Furthermore, requirements for\r\noperational simplicity have led many of these MSDCs to converge on\r\nBGP as their single routing protocol for both fabric routing and Data\r\nCenter Interconnect (DCI) routing. This document describes extensions\r\nto BGP for use with BGP Link State (BGP-LS) distribution and the\r\nShortest Path First (SPF) algorithm. In doing this, it allows BGP to\r\nbe efficiently used as both the underlay protocol and the overlay\r\nprotocol in MSDCs.","pub_date":"July 2025","keywords":["IDR"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9815","errata_url":null}
