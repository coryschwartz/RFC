UCCS enables the use of CWT claims in environments where\r\nprotection is provided by other means, such as secure communication\r\nchannels or trusted execution environments. This specification\r\ndefines a CBOR tag for UCCS and describes the UCCS format, its\r\nencoding, and its processing considerations. It also discusses\r\nsecurity implications of using unprotected claims sets.","pub_date":"May 2025","keywords":["Secure Channel","RATS","Conceptual Message Conveyance","Privacy","Confidentiality","CDDL","EAT","UJCS"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9781","errata_url":null}
