Although the registries for PCEP messages, objects, and\r\nTLV types have sub-ranges assigned for Experimental Use, the registry\r\nfor PCEP Error-Types and Error-values currently does not. This\r\ndocument updates RFC 5440 by designating a specific range of PCEP\r\nError-Types for Experimental Use.","pub_date":"March 2025","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC5440","RFC8231","RFC8233","RFC8281","RFC8623","RFC8664","RFC8685","RFC8697","RFC8733","RFC8745","RFC8779","RFC8780","RFC8800","RFC8934","RFC9050","RFC9059","RFC9168","RFC9357","RFC9504","RFC9603","RFC9604"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9756","errata_url":null}
