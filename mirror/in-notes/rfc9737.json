When the MDS is restarted, the client can\r\nstill modify the data file component. During the recovery phase of\r\nstartup, the MDS and the DSs work together to recover state. If the\r\nclient has not encountered errors with the data files, then the state\r\ncan be recovered and the resilvering of the data files can be\r\navoided. With any errors, there is no means by which the client can\r\nreport errors to the MDS. As such, the MDS has to assume that a file\r\nneeds resilvering. This document presents an extension to RFC 8435 to\r\nallow the client to update the metadata via LAYOUTRETURN and avoid\r\nthe resilvering.","pub_date":"February 2025","keywords":["NFSv4"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9737","errata_url":null}
