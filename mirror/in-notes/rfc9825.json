Previously, OSPFv2 and OSPFv3\r\nwere relegated to a single tag and only for Autonomous System (AS)\r\nExternal and Not-So-Stubby-Area (NSSA) prefixes. With the flexible\r\nencodings provided by OSPFv2 Prefix\/Link Attribute Advertisement and\r\nOSPFv3 Extended Link State Advertisements (LSAs), multiple\r\nadministrative tags may be advertised for all types of prefixes.\r\nThese administrative tags can be used for many applications including\r\nroute redistribution policy, selective prefix prioritization,\r\nselective IP Fast Reroute (IPFRR) prefix protection, and many others.","pub_date":"July 2025","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9825","errata_url":null}
