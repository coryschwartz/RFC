In particular, this document\r\ndiscusses an XR application that can run on devices having different\r\nform factors (such as different physical sizes and shapes) and needs\r\nedge computing resources to mitigate the effect of problems such as\r\nthe need to support interactive communication requiring low latency,\r\nlimited battery power, and heat dissipation from those devices.  This\r\ndocument also discusses the expected behavior of XR applications,\r\nwhich can be used to manage traffic, and the service requirements for\r\nXR applications to be able to run on the network. Network operators\r\nwho are interested in providing edge computing resources to\r\noperationalize the requirements of such applications are the intended\r\naudience for this document.","pub_date":"December 2024","keywords":["low-latency","managed-cloud","offload"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9699","errata_url":null}
