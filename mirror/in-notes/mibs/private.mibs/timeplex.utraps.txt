"INTRODUCTION"





        This document describes the SNMP Trap messages that are currently being
        sent by Timeplex network devices to the Element Management Station (EMS).
        The SNMP Trap messages are divided into 2 groups: generic and specific. Generic
        traps are those defined in RFC 1067. Timeplex network devices comply with
	the standard as well as providing additional information to further clarify
	the generic trap. Specific traps are used to identify events that are
	specific to Timeplex network devices. Here again, additional information is
	provided to clarify the specific trap.
        


"GENERIC TRAPS"


                
        An SNMP Trap message as defined in RFC 1067 contains a field named 'generic'.
        The value of this field indicates the type of generic trap. Timeplex network 
        devices use the field named 'specific' to convey additional information 
	clarifying the generic trap. RFC 1067 does not restrict the use of this field
        for generic traps. There are 32 bits available in the 'specific' field. The
        following defines the generic traps together with the values of their respective
        'generic' and 'specific' fields:


                COLDSTART TRAP 
                
                        Cause: issued upon power-up.
                          Generic field:   0
                          Specific field:  0


                WARMSTART TRAP 

			Cause: issued after a network device has reset due to some unrecoverable
				error condition.
                          Generic field:   1
                          Specific field:  process ID (bits 8-15) 
					   error code (bits 0-7)
 
                LINKDOWN TRAP 

			Cause: issued after a network link interface (LAPB) has been declared down.
                          Generic field:   2
			  Specific field:  reason (bits 30-31)
						0 = scheduled
						1 = link error
						2 = indeterminate
						3 = frame reject
						      state information (bits 0-23)
 
                LINKUP TRAP 

			Cause: issued after a network link interface (LAPB) has been declared up.
                          Generic field:   3
			  Specific field:  initial UP (bit 31)
						0 = TRUE
						1 = FALSE

		AUTHENTICATION FAILURE TRAP

                        Cause: issued whenever SNMP receives an SNMP request message that
                               is not from the EMS or has an invalid community name.
                          Generic type:  4
                          Specific type: IP address in network byte order of the source
					 of the invalid SNMP request


		EGP NEIGHBOR LOSS TRAP

                        Cause: issued whenever EGP detects that one of his neighbors is 
                               no longer responsive.
                          Generic type:  5
                          Specific type: IP address in network byte order of the EGP neighbor
					 that is mo longer responsive

"SPECIFIC TRAPS"



        The specific trap type is meaningful only when the generic trap type is SPECIFIC (=6).
        In other words, if an SNMP Trap message contains a 'generic' value of 6, them the 
        'specific' value identifies the specific trap type. The lower 8 bits identify the
	specific trap type; the upper 24 bits contain information to further clarify the
	specific trap. The following defines the specific trap types:


	FDDI SCM STATE CHANGE TRAP

		Cause: issued when a station wraps or unwraps
		  Lower 8 bits:   151
		  Upper 24 bits:  Station state [1-4] in bits 15-8
					  1 = Isolated (will not be transmitted over the network)
					  2 = Wrap A
					  3 = Wrap B
					  4 = Thru
					  6 = Cleave A (wrap A for Dual Home
					      operation)
					  7 = Cleave B (wrap B for Dual Home
					      operation)


	FDDI UPSTREAM NEIGHBOR CHANGE TRAP

		Cause: issued when a station detects a new upstream neighbor
		       has been connected to the ring.
		  Lower 8 bits:   152
		  Upper 24 bits:  not used


	FDDI DOWNSTREAM NEIGHBOR CHANGE TRAP

		Cause: issued when a station detects that a new downstream neighbor
		       has been connected to the ring.
		  Lower 8 bits:   153
		  Upper 24 bits:  not used


	FDDI CONNECT REJECTED TRAP

		Cause: issued when the station PHY rejects a neighbor PHY connection.
		  Lower 8 bits:   154
		  Upper 24 bits:  PHY resource index [1-10] in bits 23-16
				  reject code [2-6] in bits 15-8
					  2 = Neighbor Station Reject
					  3 = Connect Ports Incompatible
                                          4 = Exceesive Bit Errors on link
                                          5 = Neighbor Station Detected
                                              Excessive Bit Erros
                                          6 = Master Port to Master Port
                                              Connect Reject

					
	DUPLICATE MAC ADDRESS
		Cause: issued when a station detects when another station on
		       the ring has the same physical(MAC) address as the this
		       issuing station.
		  Lower 8 bits:   155
		  Upper 24 bits:  not used
		

	UNA DUPLICATE MAC ADDRESS
		Cause: issued when this station's upstream neighbor station
		       detects that it has a duplicate MAC address.
		  Lower 8 bits:   156
		  Upper 24 bits:  not used
		

	FDDI TWISTED RING
		Cause: issued when a station detects that its PHY A/B is
		       connected to a matching PHY A/B causing the ring to twist back on itself.
		  Lower 8 bits:   157
		  Upper 24 bits:  not used
		

	SLAVE LINK ERROR TRAP
		Cause: issued when a concentrator detects that one of its slave
		       links has exceed its CRC error rate threshold.
		  Lower 8 bits:   158
		  Upper 24 bits:  Slave port [1-8] in bits 15-8
