A set of profiles (ie, lists of MIBs supported) for 3Com products
as well as the MIBs themselves are available via anonymous ftp from
host ftp.3com.com (139.87.52.10) under /pub/3com-mibs/.  The
first thing to get is the file "README".  This will explain the structure
of the directories and the structure of the file names. 

The latest documents will always be available from that location.
