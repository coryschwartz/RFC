          1. INTRODUCTION                               


          This document provides  the initial version  of the Time/Lan  100
          Management  Information Base  (TL1  MIB)  for  use  with  network
          management protocols  over TCP/IP-based internets.  This document
          does not include  those managed objects  identified in RFC  1158;
          however, those objects are supported.

          2. OBJECTS

          The objects are arranged into the following groups:

               -- TL1 System Group 
               -- TL1 Interfaces Group 
               -- TL1 IP Group 
               -- TL1 TCP Group 
               -- TL1 EGP Group 
               -- TL1 SNMP Group 
               -- TL1 BRE Group 
               -- TL1 RIP Group
               -- TL1 X25 Group 
               -- TL1 FDDI Group 
               -- TL1 STAP Group 
               -- TL1 PPP Group 
               -- TL1 SRTB Group 
               -- TL1 OSPF Group 
               -- TL1 TOK Group 
               -- TL1 IPX Group 
               -- TL1 XNS Group 

          The following groups have been reserved (see Object Definitions),
          but no objects have yet been identified within these groups:

               -- TL1 AT (Address Translation) Group 
               -- TL1 ICMP Group 
               -- TL1 UDP Group
               -- TL1 FR Group
               -- TL1 TFTP Group
               -- TL1 TELNET Group

          Definition: 
               This is the system action  flag. 'Reset' causes the  network
               device to reinitialize itself; 'shutdown' brings the network
               device to a state where it can be restarted only by manually
               resetting the device.

          Definition: 
               This is  the number of times the  system has rebooted due to
               an unrecoverable error condition.  If initialized to -1, the
               system will not reboot following an unrecoverable error.

               INTEGER

          Definition: 
               This is the error code for  the last system reboot. It is  a
               32-bit value, where the upper 16 bits contain the process ID
               and the lower 16 bits contain the error code.

          Definition: 
               This is a  list of the TL1 interface entries.  Each entry is
               instantiated by logical interface number (1..ifNumber).

               and timers  are reset.  A value  of 255  ensures that all  errors
