                         ODS Second Generation MIB Document

            This document specifies the Management Information Base
            (MIB) for SNMP agents residing in local area network
            equipment manufactured by Optical Data Systems.  As
            indicated by the title, the MIB described here is the second
            generation of SNMP implemented at ODS.  The second
            generation MIB retains compatibility with the first
            generation MIB while greatly expanding the information
            available within ODS equipment for network management.

            The specification that follows includes only the enterprise
            branch of the MIB.  However, the MIB does include full
            support of the applicable groups in the SNMP standard MIB.
            This includes the following groups: system, interfaces,
            address translation, ip, icmp, udp.  The TCP and EGP
            protocols are not included in ODS SNMP agents and therefore,
            the tcp group and the egp group are not supported in the ODS
            MIB.

            The enterprise branch includes branches to manage ethernet
            concentrators (enc), ethernet bridges (enBridge), token ring
            concentrators (tokenRing), and token ring bridges
            (trBridge).  Currently, only the ethernet concentrators
            branch is fully specified.  The other branches will be
            specified as the SNMP agents become available.

            The MIB described here conforms to RFC 1156 (also known as
            "MIB 1").  Support for the additions found in the newly
            released RFC 1158 ("MIB 2") will be available shortly.

            2.        ODS First Generation Mib

            The ODS first generation mib is presented here for the sake
            of completeness.  It should be treated as obsolete and all
            SNMP management of an ODS agent should be performed on the
            second generation mib (section 3).

            The interface group contains information pertaining to the
            box's physical connections including global box
            configuration and specific port information.  This
            information is available more clearly and completely as a
            subset of the second generation mib in section 3.

            3.0       ODS Second Generation MIB

            The second generation MIB includes two major groups of
            objects divided between "interfaces" and "administration".
            The interfaces objects contain information for controlling
            the configuration of the concentrator and monitoring the
            traffic passing through it.  The administration objects
            contain management-related configuration information for the
            concentrator.



            3.1       Interfaces

            The interfaces on an ODS concentrator are divided in three
            groups: the box group, the card group, and the port group.
            The box group contains objects of information and control
            that are global to the concentrator.  The card group
            contains objects specific to a particular card in the
            concentrator.  The port group contains objects specific to a
            particular port on a card in the concentrator.



            3.1.1     Box Group

            The box group contains information specific to the entire
            concentrator.  It differs from the card and port groups by
            presenting information independant of where in the
            concentrator the events are occurring.  Contained in the box
            interfaces section are counters that keep statistics on the
            traffic and errors occurring throughout the concentrator.
            Also, there are gauges that are used to trigger global
            concentrator alarms.  In the box address table section, the
            entire address database is available for monitoring.



            3.1.1.1   Box Interfaces

            The box interfaces section contains counters and gauges used
            in traffic and error monitoring.  Also included are
            variables that identify the type of concentrator hardware
            and its general configuration.

            Object:  boxId { encBox 1 }

            Syntax:        INTEGER {

            Definition:    This value is a box identification code.  In
                           single card systems, the boxId is the same as
                           the cardId for the card in slot 1 (which is
                           the only card in a single-slot system).  In
                           multi-slot systems, the boxId is a chasis id
                           code and the box's hardware is further
                           defined by the cardId's found in the
                           cardTable.

            Definition:    This is a "human readable" text string
                           corresponding to the boxId and describes the
                           box's hardware.  In single-slot systems, the
                           boxDescr is the same as the cardDescr for the
                           card in slot 1.  In multi-slot systems, the
                           box's hardware is further described by the
                           cardDescr's found in the cardTable.

                           }

            Definition:    This value indicates the connection mode of
                           the network interface on the concentrator.
                           In general, this indicates if the network
                           port in the box is connected to the network.
                           More specifically, if in network mode, this
                           box is cascaded off of another ODS
                           concentrator.  In local mode, this box is
                           either the top of a cascaded configuration or
                           the only ODS concentrator in the
                           configuration.

            3.1.1.2   Box Address Table

            The box address table is a table of address-related data
            accessed by physical source address.  This table represents
            the global database of traffic history aquired by the agent.
            There is an entry in the table for every physical source
            address seen by the agent in a packet that passed through
            the concentrator.  The maximum size of the table is given by
            boxAddressCapacity.  The current size of the table is given
            by boxAddrsThru.  The database always reflects the most
            current addresses, i.e. when the table contains the maximum
            number of addresses and a new address is seen, the entry in
            the table that has seen the least recent activity is deleted
            to make room for the new address entry.

            Definition:    This is the ethernet physical source address
                           seen by the agent in a packet(s) that passed
                           through the concentrator.  This is the object
                           used to access (instantiate) a table record.
                           Using the SNMP "getnext" operation, the table
                           can be accessed in increasing address order.
                           The rest of the fields in a table entry
                           indicate information pertaining to this
                           address.  Assigning a value of NULL (via the
                           SNMP "set" operation) to this object will
                           delete the record from the database.  The
                           first time that this address is seen by the
                           agent, a NewAddressAlarm will be sent to the
                           network manager(s) via an SNMP trap.  (This
                           alarm is only reported to a manager if it has
                           enabled this type of alarm in the

            3.1.2     Card Group

            The card group presents much of the same information that is
            available in the box group but sub-divides the information
            by which card it pertains to.  The card group contains a
            card interfaces section and no card address table. (A card
            address table is not presented here since the box address
            table is also presented in the port group subdivided by card
            and port.)



            3.1.2.1   Card Interfaces

            The card interfaces section includes a few variables
            describing the sizing (number) of the cards in the
            concentrator and a card table presenting information on each
            specific card in the concentrator.



            3.1.2.1.1 Card Sizing

            The sizing information presented here includes the size of
            the chasis in slots and the current number of slots that are
            populated.

            Object:        cardCapacity { encCards 1 }

            Syntax:        INTEGER

            Definition:    This value is the number of slots in the

                           will be one.  For multi-slot systems, this
                           value will indicate the maximum number of
                           cards than be populated in the chasis.

                           value will indicate the number of slots that
                           are populated with I/O cards.  This value can
                           be zero since the network management card and

            3.1.2.1.2 Card Table

            The card table contains information for each possible slot
            in the concentrator chasis.  The table is indexed by slot
            number using cardIndex.  Unpopulated slots will still have
            an entry in the table, and all information associated with
            that slot will reflect its empty state.

            Object:        cardTable { encCards 3 }

            Syntax:        SEQUENCE OF CardtEntry

            Definition:    The card table contains an entry for each

            3.1.3     Port Group

            The port group is a further division of the global
            concentrator information into groups of information specific
            to a card/port combination.  It contains interface
            information similar to the card interface information but at
            a port level.  The port group also includes another
            representation of the address database in the form of the
            port address table.  The important distinction in this table
            is the capability to view the traffic history specific to a
            single port or combination of ports.



            3.1.3.1   Port Interfaces

            The port interfaces information is presented in the form of
            the port table.  This table includes counters and gauges
            similar to those found in the box and card groups with the
            added capability of disabling any port.



            3.1.3.1.1 Port Table

            The port table contains an entry for every port on every
            card in the concentrator.  It is indexed by a slot/port
            combination given by portSlot and portIndex.

            3.1.3.2   Port Address Table

            The port address table is a table of address-related data
            accessed by a combination of card, port, and physical source
            address.  This table represents the global database of
            traffic history aquired by the agent divided by slot and
            port.  In each division of the table (specified by slot and
            port), there is an entry in the table for every physical
            source address seen by the agent in a packet that passed
            through the specified port of the concentrator.  The maximum
            size of the table is given by boxAddressCapacity.  The size
            of all of the divisions of the table combined is equal to
            the size of the entire table.  The current size of each
            slot/port division of the table is given by the
            portAddrsThru value for the specified slot/port.  The
            database always reflects the most current addresses, i.e.
            when the table contains the maximum number of addresses and
            a new address is seen, the entry in the table that has seen
            the least recent activity is deleted to make room for the
            new address entry.  Because of this, a new address seen on
            one port of the concentrator can cause an entry to be
            deleted from a division of the database associated with a
            different port.

            3.2.1     Out-of-band Configuration

            The out-of-band configuration objects are used to determine
            the specifics of the serial connection.  Also, the time and
            date objects are used to set the real-time-clock used by the
            agent when reporting statistics through the serial
            connection.

            3.2.2     Community Strings Table

            The community strings table is used to restrict different
            levels of access to a concentrator agent by a network
            manager(s).  Different community strings can be entered into
            the table with assigned access priveleges.  By restricting
            the knowledge of these community strings, a network
            administrator can control which management stations can
            manage the concentrator.  There are five levels of privelege
            that can be assigned to a community string: none - no access
            to the concentrator agent is allowed, read-only - monitoring
            of the concentrator agent is permitted, read-write -
            monitoring and control of the concentrator agent is
            permitted, super - read/write access to restricted areas of
            the MIB are permitted.  The restricted areas of the MIB
            include the community string table and the trap table.
            Without super priveleges, neither reading or writing of
            these objects is permitted.

            3.2.3     Trap Table

            The trap table is used to assign trap receiving levels and
            their associated community strings to network managers.  A
            table record includes the IP address to report traps to, the
            community string used when reporting the trap, and several
            enables that can be used to selectively filter which types
            of traps are reported to that IP address using that
            community string.  This provides the capability for the same
            network manager or different network managers to receive
            different types of traps using whatever community strings
            they might require.
