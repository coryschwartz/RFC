          1.  Status of this Memo

          This document is a private extension to the SNMP MIB.
          Distribution of this memo is unlimited.  Please send comments

          2.  Abstract

          This memo defines a private portion of the Management
          Information Base (MIB) for use with network management
          protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.  In particular, it
          defines objects for managing Threshold Crossing Alert
          information for managed interfaces. An interface can for
          example be an SMDS Subscriber-Network Interface or Inter-
          Carrier Interface (SNI/ICI), Frame Relay User-Network
          Interface or Inter-Carrier Interface (UNI/ICI), or ATM-based
          CRS User-Network Interface or Inter-Carrier Interface
          (UNI/ICI).

          This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet
          community.

          3.  The Network Management Framework

          The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework consists of four major
          components.  They are:

           o    RFC 1442 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
                describing and naming objects for the purpose of
                management.

           o    RFC 1213 defines MIB-II, the core set of managed objects
                for the Internet suite of protocols.

           o    RFC 1445 which defines the administrative and other
                architectural aspects of the framework.

           o    RFC 1448 which defines the protocol used for network
                access to managed objects.

          The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the
          purpose of experimentation and evaluation.

          4.  Object Definitions

          Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
          termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the
          MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation
          One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object
          object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an
          administratively assigned name.  The object type together with
          an object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific
          instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we often
          use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the
          object type.

          5.  Overview

          These objects are used in the context of a SNMP-based Customer
          Network Management (CNM) service and Exchange Access
          Operations Management (XA-OM) that can be provided by networks
          supporting SMDS, Frame Relay Service, and Cell Relay Service.
          See references [5] - [8].

          This MIB provides Threshold Crossing Alert (TCA) information
          to a CNM or XA-OM subscriber.  A Threshold Crossing Alert is a
          message that is sent from a switching system to an OS (e.g.,
          SNMP agent) whenever a counter value crosses a predefined
          threshold.  The switching system collects information over a
          15-minute interval, and the threshold value is an absolute
          value for the counter over that 15-minute interval.
          Therefore, each counter value can only cross a threshold once
          over a 15-minute period. This MIB represents what TCAs have
          been received for each interface sublayer.  An interface
          sublayer can be the protocol sublayers of an SMDS Subscriber-
          Network Interface or Inter-Carrier Interface (SNI/ICI), Frame
          Relay User-Network Interface or Inter-Carrier Interface
          (UNI/ICI), or ATM-based CRS User-Network Interface or Inter-
          Carrier Interface (UNI/ICI).  See References [5] - [8] for the
          definitions of the protocol sublayers for each service
          interface.  Capturing TCA information in this MIB is
          necessary, because many Fast Packet Switching Systems are not
          capable of meeting the data currency objective of 180 seconds
          as described in the Bellcore Technical Advisories/References.
          However, the Switching Systems are capable of alerting the
          SNMP agent when a counter value exceeds a predefined threshold
          via the TCA mechanism.  These TCAs can be translated into SNMP
          objects that can be provided to the CNM or XA-OM subscriber.





          Tracy A. Brown, Kaj Tesink (editors)                  [Page 3]






          Bellcore       Threshold Crossing Alert Objects      June 1994


          Therefore, even though CNM or XA-OM subscribers do not have
          access to current counter values, they will have access to
          information regarding what counters have crossed a threshold
          within a 15-minute interval.  Therefore, threshold crossing
          information provides these subscribers with a timely fault
          detection/isolation capability.  A CNM subscriber may use this
          information for multiple network management functions and
          capabilities.  In addition to TCAs, this MIB module allows the
          definition of other thresholding conditions that are unrelated
          to 15 minute intervals.

          There are two mechanisms in which a CNM and XA-OM subscriber
          receives TCA information.  One mechanism is by polling the
          objects defined in this TCA MIB (primarily the tcaCounts
          object), and the other is by being asynchronously alerted of a
          TCA via an SNMP trap message called the fyiTrap. See Reference
          [10] for a description of the fyiTrap.  However, to control
          the potential flood of traps being sent to a CNM and XA-OM
          subscriber, some TCA information may not cause a trap to be
          automatically generated.  See the tcaTrapEnabler object.  This
          object is read-write.  However, initially the object has a
          minimum access of read-only.  It is envisioned that in the
          future, the CNM and XA-OM subscriber may change the value of
          the tcaTrapEnabler, thus requesting what TCAs should generate
          traps.

          The counters being thresholded are defined in the following
          Bellcore documents:

          --  TR-TSV-001062, SMDS CNM Service

          --  GR-1371-CORE, Frame Relay PVC CNM Service

          --  GR-1117-CORE, CNM Service for Exchange PVC Cell Relay Service

          --  TA-TSV-001237, SMDS XA-OM Service

          --  TA-NWT-001430, Frame Relay PVC XA-OM Service

          Each document will also specify a default value for the
          tcaTrapEnabler object for each counter.

          When the service is defined, this MIB may also be used for
          XA-OM service for Exchange Access PVC Cell Relay Service.

                          alarm may be triggered when the value has
                          risen a delta amount within a sample period.
                      (b) IntervalCounter values can only rise within an
                          interval and are reset at the end of the
                          interval. An alarm may be triggered when
                          the value has exceeded an absolute value.
                      (c) A Gauge value may rise and fall. An alarm
                          may be triggered when the value has risen or
                          fallen a certain amount.
                      (d) An INTEGER may assume values in any sequence.
                          An alarm may be triggered when the value
                          does equal or doesnot equal a certain
                          specified value.
                      (e) A bitmap may assume values that represent
                          one or more bits to be set. An alarm may be
                          triggered when the value does include or not
                          include the combined value of certain bits.
                          Note that for (c), (d), and (e) only one alarm
                          needs to be generated, i.e., at first detection
                          of this event."
