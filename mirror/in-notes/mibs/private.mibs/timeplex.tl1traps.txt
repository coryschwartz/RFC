   1. INTRODUCTION





    This document describes the SNMP Trap messages that are currently being
    sent by TIME/LAN network devices to a Network Management Station (NMS).
    The SNMP Trap messages are divided into 2 groups: generic and specific.
    Generic traps are those defined in RFC 1157. TIME/LAN network devices 
    comply with the standard as well as providing additional information 
    to further clarify the generic traps. Specific traps are used to identify
    events that are germane to TIME/LAN network devices. Here again, 
    additional information is provided to clarify the specific traps.
        


    2. GENERIC TRAPS


                
    An SNMP Trap message as defined in RFC 1157 contains a field named 
    'generic'. The value of this field indicates the type of generic 
    trap. TIME/LAN network devices convey additional information through
    the 'variable binding list' (VBL).


    COLDSTART TRAP 
        Cause: issued upon power-up or reset.
        Generic field:   0
        VBL: NULL


    WARMSTART TRAP 
        Cause: issued after a network device has reset due to 
                some unrecoverable error condition.
        Generic field: 1
        VBL: TL1 MIB variable 'tl1snmpLastTrapMessage'

    LINKDOWN TRAP 
        Cause: issued after a network link interface has 
                been declared down.
        Generic field: 2
        VBL: MIB II variable 'ifIndex'          


    LINKUP TRAP 
        Cause: issued after a network link interface 
                has been declared up.
        Generic field: 3
        VBL: MIB II variable 'ifIndex'          


    AUTHENTICATION FAILURE TRAP
        Cause: issued whenever SNMP receives an SNMP request
                message that is not from a valid NMS or has
                an invalid community name.
        Generic type: 4
        VBL: TL1 MIB variable 'tl1snmpLastTrapMessage'


    EGP NEIGHBOR LOSS TRAP
        Cause: issued whenever EGP detects that one of his neighbors 
                is no longer responding.
        Generic type:  5
        VBL:  MIB II variable 'egpNeighAddr'     


    3. SPECIFIC TRAPS



    The specific trap type is meaningful only when the generic trap type 
    is SPECIFIC (=6). In other words, if an SNMP Trap message contains a
    'generic' value of 6, them the 'specific' value identifies the specific
    trap type. The following defines the specific trap types:


    3.1. FDDI Traps


    PC TRACE FDDI RESET 
     Cause: issued when the FDDI interface is reset as
                part of the 'ring trace' recovery process.

        VBL: MIB II variable 'ifIndex'
