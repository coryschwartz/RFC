The entire topology is continually in motion, with links\r\nfar less reliable than what is common in terrestrial networks. Some\r\nchanges to link connectivity can be anticipated due to orbital\r\ndynamics.\r\n\r\nThis document proposes a scalable routing architecture for satellite\r\nnetworks based on existing routing protocols and mechanisms that is\r\nenhanced with scheduled link connectivity change information. This\r\ndocument proposes no protocol changes.\r\n\r\nThis document presents the author's view and is neither the product\r\nof the IETF nor a consensus view of the community.","pub_date":"January 2025","keywords":["IS-IS","MPLS","Segment routing"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9717","errata_url":null}
