Unfortunately, both RFCs\r\ncontradict each other regarding how recording metadata is to be\r\nlabeled. In addition, neither RFC registered the new media type. This\r\ndocument updates RFC 7866 to align with RFC 7865 when labeling\r\nrecording metadata and also registers the media type.","pub_date":"June 2025","keywords":["siprec","errata"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC7866"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9806","errata_url":null}
