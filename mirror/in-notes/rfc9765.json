The extensions allow the negotiation of a transport\r\nprofile where the RADIUS shared secret is no longer used, and all\r\nMD5-based packet authentication and attribute obfuscation methods are\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nThis document updates RFCs 2865, 2866, 5176, 6613, 6614, and 7360.","pub_date":"April 2025","keywords":["RADIUS","ALPN","MD5","FIPS 140","TLS"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC2865","RFC2866","RFC5176","RFC6613","RFC6614","RFC7360"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9765","errata_url":null}
