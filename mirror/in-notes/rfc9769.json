These new modes improve the accuracy of time\r\nsynchronization by enabling the use of more accurate transmit\r\ntimestamps that are available only after the transmission of NTP\r\nmessages. These enhancements are intended to improve timekeeping in\r\nenvironments where high accuracy is critical. This document updates\r\nRFC 5905 by defining these new operational modes.","pub_date":"May 2025","keywords":["NTP","interleaved mode"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC5905"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9769","errata_url":null}
