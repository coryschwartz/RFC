It is most useful when media is encrypted and essential when\r\nthe middlebox or node has no access to the media decryption keys. It\r\nis also useful for codec-agnostic processing of encrypted or\r\nunencrypted media, while it also supports extensions for\r\ncodec-specific information.","pub_date":"March 2025","keywords":["Scalable video","H.264","H.265","VP9","layered video"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9626","errata_url":null}
