MLD is used by an IPv6 router to discover the\r\npresence of multicast listeners on directly attached links and to\r\ndiscover which multicast addresses are of interest to those\r\nneighboring nodes.  MLDv2 is designed to be interoperable with MLDv1.\r\n MLDv2 adds the ability for a node to report interest in listening to\r\npackets with a particular multicast address only from specific source\r\naddresses or from all sources except for specific source addresses.\r\n\r\nThis document updates RFC 2710 and obsoletes RFC 3810.","pub_date":"March 2025","keywords":[],"obsoletes":["RFC3810"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC2710"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["STD0101"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9777","errata_url":null}
