However, all the OSPFv3 Prefix\r\nOptions bits have already been assigned, and only a few bits remain\r\nunassigned in the Flags field of the OSPFv2 Extended Prefix TLV.\r\n\r\nThis document solves this problem by defining a variable-length\r\nPrefix Extended Flags sub-TLV for OSPF. This sub-TLV is applicable to\r\nOSPFv2 and OSPFv3.","pub_date":"June 2025","keywords":["Prefix attributes","IGP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9792","errata_url":null}
