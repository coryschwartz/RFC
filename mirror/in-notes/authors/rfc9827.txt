   Renaming the Extended Sequence Number (ESN) Transform Type in the
            Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2)

Abstract

   This document clarifies and extends the meaning of Transform Type 5
   in Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2).  It updates RFC
   7296 by renaming Transform Type 5 from "Extended Sequence Numbers
   (ESN)" to "Sequence Numbers (SN)".  It also renames two currently
   defined values for this Transform Type: value 0 from "No Extended
   Sequence Numbers" to "32-bit Sequential Numbers" and value 1 from
   "Extended Sequence Numbers" to "Partially Transmitted 64-bit
   Sequential Numbers".

1.  Introduction

   The IP Security (IPsec) Architecture [RFC4301] defines a set of
   security services provided by the Authentication Header (AH)
   [RFC4302] and Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [RFC4303].  One of
   these services is replay protection, which is referred to as "anti-
   replay" in these documents.  In IPsec, the anti-replay service is
   optional; each receiver of AH and/or ESP packets can choose whether
   to enable it on a per Security Association (SA) basis.  The replay
   protection in AH and ESP is achieved by means of a monotonically
   increasing counter that never wraps around and is sent in each AH or
   ESP packet in the Sequence Number field.  The receiver maintains a
   sliding window that allows duplicate packets to be detected.

   Both AH and ESP allow use of either a 32-bit counter or a 64-bit
   counter.  The latter case is referred to as Extended Sequence Numbers
   (ESN) in AH and ESP specifications.  Since the Sequence Number field
   in both AH and ESP headers is only 32 bits in size, in case of ESN
   the high-order 32 bits of the counter are not transmitted and are
   determined by the receiver based on previously received packets.

   The receiver decides whether to enable the anti-replay service based
   only on the receiver's local policy, so the sender, in accordance
   with the specifications for AH ([RFC4302], Section 3.3.2) and ESP
   ([RFC4303], Section 3.3.3), should always assume that the replay
   protection is enabled on the receiving side.  Thus, the sender should
   always send the increasing counter values and should take care that
   the counter never wraps around.  AH and ESP specifications also
   discuss situations in which replay protection is not possible to
   achieve, even if senders do all as prescribed -- like in multicast
   Security Associations with multiple unsynchronized senders.  Both AH
   and ESP specifications allow the sender to avoid maintaining the
   counter if the sender has been notified that the anti-replay service
   is disabled by the receiver or is not possible to achieve.

   AH and ESP Security Associations are usually established using IKEv2
   [RFC7296].  The process of SA establishment includes calculation of a
   shared key and negotiation of various SA parameters, such as
   cryptographic algorithms.  This negotiation in IKEv2 is performed via
   transforms (see Section 3.3.2 of [RFC7296]).  The type of transform
   determines what parameter is being negotiated.  Each Transform Type
   has an associated list of possible values (called Transform IDs) that
   determine the possible options for negotiation.  See [IKEV2-IANA] for
   the list of Transform Types and associated Transform IDs.

   Transform Type 5 ("Extended Sequence Numbers (ESN)") is used in IKEv2
   to negotiate the way sequence numbers for replay protection are
   generated, transmitted, and processed in the context of an SA.  There
   are two values are defined for this Transform Type -- "No Extended
   Sequence Numbers" and "Extended Sequence Numbers".

   This document updates the IKEv2 specification [RFC7296] by renaming
   Transform Type 5 and the two associated Transform IDs.

2.  Problem Description

   IKEv2 currently has no means to negotiate the case when both peers
   agree that replay protection is not needed.  Even when both peers
   locally disable anti-replay service as receivers, they still need to
   maintain increasing sequence numbers as senders, taking care that
   they never wrap around (see [ANTIREPLAY]).

   There is also no way to inform receivers that replay protection is
   not possible for a particular SA (for example in case of a multicast
   SA with several unsynchronized senders).

   Future IPsec protocols may provide more options for the handling of
   anti-replay counters, like sending full 64-bit sequence numbers or
   completely omitting them in packets (see [EESP]).  These options will
   require means to be negotiated in IKEv2.

   Transform Type 5 is the best candidate for addressing these issues:
   it is already used for negotiation of how sequence numbers are
   handled in AH and ESP, and it is possible to define additional
   Transform IDs that could be used in the corresponding situations.
   However, the current definition of Transform Type 5 is too narrow --
   its name implies that this transform can only be used for negotiation
   of using ESN.

3.  Extending the Semantics of Transform Type 5

   This document extends the semantics of Transform Type 5 in IKEv2 to
   the following definition.

   Transform Type 5 defines the set of properties of sequence numbers of
   IPsec packets of a given SA when these packets enter the network.

   This definition requires some clarifications.

   *  By "sequence numbers" here we assume logical entities (like
      counters) that can be used for replay protection on receiving
      sides.  In particular, these entities are not necessarily the
      content of the Sequence Number field in the IPsec packets, but may
      be constructed using some information, that is not necessarily
      transmitted.

   *  The properties are interpreted as characteristics of IPsec SA
      packets rather than the results of sender actions.  For example,
      in multicast SA with multiple unsynchronized senders, even if each
      sender ensures the uniqueness of sequence numbers it generates,
      the uniqueness of sequence numbers for all IPsec packets is not
      guaranteed.

   *  The properties are defined for the packets just entering the
      network and not for the packets that receivers get.  This is
      because network behavior may break some of these properties (e.g.,
      packet duplication would break sequence number uniqueness).

   *  The properties of sequence numbers are interpreted in a broad
      sense, which includes the case when sequence numbers are absent.

   Given this updated definition, Transform Type 5 in the "Transform
   Type Values" registry [IKEV2-IANA] has been renamed from "Extended
   Sequence Numbers (ESN)" to "Sequence Numbers (SN)".

   It is expected that new Transform IDs will be defined for this
   Transform Type in the future (like in G-IKEv2 [G-IKEv2] for the case
   of multicast SAs).  Documents defining new Transform IDs should
   include descriptions of the properties the sequence numbers would
   have if the new Transform ID was selected.  In particular, the
   descriptions should include discussion of whether these properties
   allow replay protection to be achieved.

   Some existing protocols (like Implicit IV in ESP [RFC8750] or
   Aggregation and Fragmentation for ESP [RFC9347]) rely on properties
   that are guaranteed for the currently defined Transform IDs; however,
   this might not be true for future Transform IDs.  When a new
   Transform ID is defined, its description should include discussion
   about the possibility of using the Transform ID in protocols that
   rely on some particular properties of sequence numbers.

   The two currently defined Transform IDs for Transform Type 5 define
   the following properties of sequence numbers.

   *  Value 0 defines sequence numbers as monotonically increasing
      32-bit counters that are transmitted in the Sequence Number field
      of AH and ESP packets.  They never wrap around and are guaranteed
      to be unique, thus they are suitable for replay protection.  They
      can also be used with protocols that rely on sequence number
      uniqueness (e.g., [RFC8750]) or their monotonic increase (e.g.,
      [RFC9347]).  The sender and the receiver actions are defined in
      Sections 3.3.2 and 3.4.3 of [RFC4302] for AH and in Sections 3.3.3
      and 3.4.3 of [RFC4303] for ESP.

   *  Value 1 defines sequence numbers as monotonically increasing
      64-bit counters.  The low-order 32 bits are transmitted in the
      Sequence Number field of AH and ESP packets, and the high-order 32
      bits are implicitly determined on receivers based on previously
      received packets.  The sequence numbers never wrap around and are
      guaranteed to be unique, thus they are suitable for replay
      protection.  They can also be used with protocols that rely on
      sequence number uniqueness (e.g., [RFC8750]) or their monotonic
      increase (e.g., [RFC9347]).  To correctly process the incoming
      packets on receivers, the packets must be authenticated (even when
      the replay protection is not used).  The sender and the receiver
      actions are defined in Sections 3.3.2 and 3.4.3 of [RFC4302] for
      AH and in Sections 3.3.3 and 3.4.3 of [RFC4303] for ESP.

   Given the descriptions above and the new definition of Transform Type
   5, the two currently defined Transform IDs are renamed to better
   reflect the properties of sequence numbers they assume.

   *  Transform ID 0 is renamed from "No Extended Sequence Numbers" to
      "32-bit Sequential Numbers".

   *  Transform ID 1 is renamed from "Extended Sequence Numbers" to
      "Partially Transmitted 64-bit Sequential Numbers".

   Note that the above descriptions do not change the existing semantics
   of these Transform IDs, they only provide clarification.  Also note
   that ESP and AH packet processing for these Transform IDs is not
   affected, and bits on the wire do not change.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not affect security of the AH, ESP, and IKEv2
   protocols.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes changes to registries within the "Internet Key
   Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) Parameters" registry group [IKEV2-IANA].

   The "Transform Type Values" registry has been updated as follows:

   *  renamed Transform Type 5 from "Extended Sequence Numbers (ESN)" to
      "Sequence Numbers (SN)".

   *  added as a reference to this RFC for Transform Type 5.

   *  added the following note:

      |  The "Sequence Numbers (SN)" Transform Type was originally named
      |  "Extended Sequence Numbers (ESN)" and was referenced by that
      |  name in a number of RFCs published prior to [RFC9827], which
      |  gave it the current title.

   The "Transform Type 5 - Extended Sequence Numbers Transform IDs"
   registry has been updated as follows:

   *  renamed the registry from "Transform Type 5 - Extended Sequence
      Numbers Transform IDs" to "Transform Type 5 - Sequence Numbers
      Transform IDs" and added this document as a reference.

   *  split the "Reserved" (2-65535) range of numbers as shown below.

            +============+==========================+===========+
            | Number     | Name                     | Reference |
            +============+==========================+===========+
            | 2-1023     | Unassigned                           |
            +------------+--------------------------+-----------+
            | 1024-65535 | Reserved for Private Use | [RFC9827] |
            +------------+--------------------------+-----------+

                                   Table 1

   *  renamed Transform ID 0 from "No Extended Sequence Numbers" to
      "32-bit Sequential Numbers".

   *  renamed Transform ID 1 from "Extended Sequence Numbers" to
      "Partially Transmitted 64-bit Sequential Numbers".

   *  added a reference to this RFC for Transform ID 0 and Transform ID
      1.

   *  added the the following registry notes:

      |  This registry was originally named "Transform Type 5 - Extended
      |  Sequence Numbers Transform IDs" and was referenced using that
      |  name in a number of RFCs published prior to [RFC9827], which
      |  gave it the current title.

      |  The "32-bit Sequential Numbers" Transform ID was originally
      |  named "No Extended Sequence Numbers" and was referenced by that
      |  name in a number of RFCs published prior to [RFC9827], which
      |  gave it the current title.

      |  The "Partially Transmitted 64-bit Sequential Numbers" Transform
      |  ID was originally named "Extended Sequence Numbers" and was
      |  referenced by that name in a number of RFCs published prior to
      |  [RFC9827], which gave it the current title.

      |  Numbers in the range 2-65535 were originally marked as
      |  "Reserved" and were reclassified as "Unassigned" and "Reserved
      |  for Private Use" by [RFC9827].
