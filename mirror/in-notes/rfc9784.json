These solutions offer advanced\r\nmultihoming capabilities. Specifically, they support Single-Active\r\nand All-Active redundancy modes for an Ethernet Segment (ES), which\r\nis defined as a collection of physical links connecting a multihomed\r\ndevice or network to a set of Provider Edge (PE) devices. This\r\ndocument extends the concept of an ES by allowing an ES to be\r\nassociated with a set of Ethernet Virtual Circuits (EVCs), such as\r\nVLANs, or other entities, including MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs)\r\nor pseudowires (PWs). This extended concept is referred to as virtual\r\nEthernet Segments (vESes). This document lists the requirements and\r\nspecifies the necessary extensions to support vES in both EVPN and\r\nPBB-EVPN.","pub_date":"June 2025","keywords":["vES","Virtual ES"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9784","errata_url":null}
