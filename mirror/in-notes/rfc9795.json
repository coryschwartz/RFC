This framework is intended\r\nto include and extend caller- and call-specific information beyond\r\nhuman-readable display name, comparable to the \"Caller ID\" function\r\ncommon on the telephone network. It is also enhanced with an\r\nintegrity mechanism that is designed to protect the authoring and\r\ntransport of this information for different authoritative use cases.","pub_date":"July 2025","keywords":["Identity"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9795","errata_url":null}
