Some BIER-specific information and states, which\r\nare only in proportion to the number of BIER routers but not\r\nper-tree, do need to be advertised, calculated, and maintained. This\r\ndocument describes BGP extensions for advertising the BIER\r\ninformation and methods for calculating BIER states based on the\r\nadvertisements.","pub_date":"June 2025","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9793","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc9793"}
