It specifies which\r\nfields within the COSE Key structure are included in the\r\ncryptographic hash computation, the process for creating a canonical\r\nrepresentation of these fields, and how to hash the resulting byte\r\nsequence. The resulting hash value, referred to as a \"thumbprint\",\r\ncan be used to identify or select the corresponding key.","pub_date":"December 2024","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9679","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc9679"}
