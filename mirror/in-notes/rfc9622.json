This API enables\r\nfaster deployment of new protocols and protocol features without\r\nrequiring changes to the applications. The specified API follows the\r\nTransport Services Architecture by providing asynchronous, atomic\r\ntransmission of Messages. It is intended to replace the BSD Socket\r\nAPI as the common interface to the transport layer, in an environment\r\nwhere endpoints could select from multiple network paths and\r\npotential transport protocols.","pub_date":"January 2025","keywords":["Happy Eyeballs","Transport Selection"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9622","errata_url":null}
