This document specifies the requirements and provides a\r\nframework for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) in\r\nGeneve networks. It outlines the OAM functions necessary to monitor,\r\ndiagnose, and troubleshoot Geneve overlay networks to ensure proper\r\noperation and performance. The document aims to guide the\r\nimplementation of OAM mechanisms within the Geneve protocol to\r\nsupport network operators in maintaining reliable and efficient\r\nvirtualized network environments.","pub_date":"May 2025","keywords":["OAM"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9772","errata_url":null}
