Dear CSNET Liaisons and Users,

CSNET will reach an important milestone in 1984.  After a successful three-year
development effort, the network will become a fully operational utility,
offering telephone and high-speed public data network access for CSNET members
and an online database of user information.  Since 1981, membership in CSNET
has grown from a handful of institutions to nearly 100, representing many of
the major academic and corporate research centers in the United States.

From its inception, CSNET was intended to become a self-financing and
self-managing organization based on member support.  To this end, the National
Science Foundation has awarded a new contract to the University Corporation for
Atmospheric Research (UCAR) in Boulder, Colorado to assume the management of
CSNET.  UCAR was chosen in part because of its long experience with and
commitment to member-run organizations: it is a non-profit corporation which
for 25 years has managed a major scientific facility, the National Center for
Atmospheric Research, on behalf of a consortium of more than 50 universities.

One of UCAR's first tasks will be to establish an Executive Committee, made up
of representatives of the CSNET user community, to oversee the operation of the
network and plan future directions.  Plans also call for UCAR to hire an
Executive Director for CSNET (we will be soliciting your suggestions about
this) and to organize the network to be self-supporting within three years.
Dr. Leonard Romney, Executive Officer of UCAR, will assume the director's
responsibilities until that position is filled.  If you have any questions
about UCAR's new role, you may contact him by sending netmail to
romney@csnet-sh or by calling his office, (303) 497-1662.

As part of the management transition, network operations will be centralized at
Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc. (BBN), currently the host of the CIC.  This means
that all of the network computing facilities -- the two relays and the Service
Host -- will be moving to BBN in the coming months.  The shifts have been
planned to minimize disruptions in your service; a complete schedule is below.

We do know that some inconvenience to you will be unavoidable.  We'll do all we
can to prepare you for these changes and to assist you if you have problems.
And to keep you posted about upcoming events, we will be sending you a series
of Bulletins like this one.  In addition, liaisons at sites where technical
revisions will be necessary will receive detailed, specific information about
those changes.  If you have any questions during the transition, please contact
the CIC by sending a message to cic@csnet-sh or by calling (617) 497-2777.

CSNET is the product of thousands of hours of work by the project sponsor
(NSF), the project contractors (Delaware, Wisconsin, Purdue, Rand, and BBN),
and volunteer professionals representing many different organizations who have
contributed their advice and guidance.  Many of you are among the latter.  We
look forward to working with you to keep CSNET a vital and viable organization.

Sincerely,

CSNET MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE
