INTERNET MONTHLY REPORTS
------------------------

The purpose of these reports is to communicate to the Internet Research
Group the accomplishments, milestones reached, or problems discovered by
the participating organizations.

Each organization is expected to submit a 1/2 page report on the first
business day of the month describing the previous month's activities.
These reports should be submitted via network mail to "IMR-ED@ISI.EDU".

The Internet Monthly Report mailing list is now managed by MajorDomo at
ISI.EDU.  The announcements of new issues on the Internet Monthly Report
are sent to the IETF-Announce list and to this IMR list.

Requests to be ADDED or DELETED from the Internet Monthly report list
should be sent to "majordomo@isi.edu" with the message body either
"subscribe imr" or "unsubscribe imr".

Details on obtaining the current IMR, or back issues, via FTP or EMAIL
may be obtained by sending an EMAIL message to "rfc-info@ISI.EDU" with
the message body "help: ways_to_get_imrs".  For example:

        To: rfc-info@ISI.EDU

                   IETF Monthly Report for November, 1996

     1. The IETF returns to San Jose, California on December 9-13, 1996.
        Our local host will be cisco Systems. The Secretariat will open
        for registrations the first part of October. The IETF opens 1997
        in Memphis, Tennessee where Federal Express will be the host.
        This meeting will be held April 7-11, 1997. Following Memphis,
        the IETF is we returning to Europe and will met in Munich,
        Germany August 11-15, 1997, hosted by Digi/ISOC.DE. The
        Secretariat is still working on the final meeting of 1997.

        Once all the arrangements have been made, notifications will be
        sent to the IETF Announcement list. Remember that information
        on future IETF meetings can be always be found in the file
        0mtg-sites.txt which is located on the IETF shadow directories.
        This information can also be viewed from the IETF Home Page on
        the Web. The URL is:

                             http://www.ietf.org


     2. The minutes of the IESG teleconferences have been publicly
        available on the IETF Shadow directories since 1991. These
        files are placed in the /ftp/iesg directory.

        The following IESG minutes have been added:

     REGISTRATION SERVICES


     I.  Significant Events

     Help Desk Support

     * The Call Center Manager is now on call 24 hours a day
     via pager.
     * As part of the selection process for a new PBX/ACD system,
     three customer site visits were made by Tim McLain and Debbie
     Fuller to view installed and operational systems.
     * The Call Center reconfiguration was completed and Billing
     CSRs moved downstairs from the third floor into the newly
     configured Call Center on the first floor.

     Name Registration Support

     * The Processing Center Manager is now on call 24 hours a
     day via pager.
     * Approximately 96% of the total new domains registered in
     October were processed automatically.

     Billing Support

     * Record amounts of payments were received in November, causing
     significant challenges in processing payments in a timely manner.
     * A plan was developed to perform a large volume of problem
     reconciliation tasks related to customer payments; many of these
     involve payments submitted without a copy of the invoice or other
     identifying documentation stating to what name a payment should
     be applied.
     *Work space was freed up in the Receivables area to provide work
     space for temporary hires to work on the elimination of the
     payment data entry backlog and the reconciliation tasks.
     * The process of outsourcing most fulfillment services was
     started; this includes printing, folding, inserting, bar-coding,
     and mailing of invoices and 15-Day Deactivation Letters;
     previously, just the folding, inserting, and mailing tasks were
     outsourced.

     INTERNIC DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES


     In July, InterNIC Directory and Database Services took over
     generation of the Netfind seed database.  We have recently changed
     the procedure used to build that database and future versions will
     contain a great deal more data than the previous versions (the new
     database contains over 760,000 entries).  The new database is also
     substantially larger (about 4 times larger) than the previous
     version, so sites that are running Netfind servers may need to
     allocate more space to the database.

     These changes do NOT affect Netfind users.  Users can continue to
     use Netfind the same way.  The additional data should improve the
     accuracy of Netfind searches but users should see no major
     differences in the way they use the system.

     Sites running Netfind servers should check

                http://ds.internic.net/wp/netfind-seeddb.html

     for information on the new seed database and the new version of
     Netfind that supports it.  The old seed database and older version
     of Netfind remain available and can also be accessed through the
     above URL.

     THE US DOMAIN REGISTRY

     The US Domain online line registration form may be found at
     http://www.isi.edu/us-domain/.

     The US Domain administrator no longer makes direct registrations of
     hosts, and only makes delegations of third or fourth level domain
     names (such as localities).

     Some of the processing of the requests to the third level domain
     name is now automated. In particular, most requests to register
     names in localities already delegated are automatically forwarded
     to the administrator for that locality.

     A limit has been added to the criteria for delegating domain names
     under the US Domain:

         It is the intention that the delegation of third level (for
         example, locality) domain names be wide spread to many
         registries.  It is undesirable for one person or organization
         to manage a large part of the third level names in any
         particular geographic or logical area.

         No individual or organization shall have more than 500
         delegations total in the US Domain as a whole, or more than 50
         delegation in any particuilar second level (for example, a
         state).

     The special domains under the state codes:

         The K12, CC, TEC, LIB, STATE, DST, COG and GEN domain under
         each state are established for special purposes (see RFC 1480).







IMR Editor                                                     [Page 21]

Internet Monthly Report                                    November 1996


         In addition to the constaint to use them only for the defined
         purpose, each of these special domains is also to delegated
         only to a manager  within the state, and the operation of the
         delegated registry should be non-profit.

         The LIB domain should be managed by a govermental or
         educational library organization.

         Further, it is most appropriate for the K12, CC, and TEC,
         domains to be managed by an educational organization (for
         example, a university or a department of education), or a state
         government agency.

         The STATE domain is most appropriately managed by an agency of
         the state government.  DST and COG should be managed by a
         goverment agency.

         The GEN domain may be delegated to any organization that will
         provide the registration service for free (and remember the
         purpose of the GEN domain is to register statewide non-profit
         organizations).

     To obtain a copy of the list of other delegated localities and
     subdomains not administered by the US Domain Registrar, get the

MERIT INTERNET ENGINEERING
--------------------------

     This report summarizes November 1996 activities of Merit's Internet
     Engineering group on behalf of the Routing Arbiter (RA) service and
     other projects.

     Jerry Winters, Xin Liu, and Craig Labovitz are developing a
     distributed version of RAWhoisd, the RADB whois server.  Known as
     Trawhoisd (Trivial rawhoisd), the new server will allow users to
     cache any or all of the databases in the Internet Routing Registry
     on local workstations, giving users complete, local administrative
     control of their own registry.  The streamlined Trawhoisd code is
     easy to install and run, and will be ported to a variety of
     platforms.  Users can select a subset of the registries to be
     locally cached--only AS objects, Route objects, or Maintainer
     objects, for example.  This kind of flexibility brings considerable
     savings in cache storage requirements--a major concern for users
     maintaining their own copies of the IRR.

     Trawhoisd supports data caching in two ways:  by FTP and by
     mirroring.  When cached data is mirrored, users can choose to
     update the cache every few minutes, providing near real-time
     accuracy for the data.  The RIPE NCC currently supports mirroring,
     and Merit will soon support its own database mirroring site.  This
     will mean that other IRR organizations, such as MCI, CA*net, and
     RIPE, can update their database copies with new RADB data as
     frequently as every five minutes, rather than every 24 hours.

     Trawhoisd will serve compute-intensive users, such as those using
     RAToolSet to generate router configurations.  The requirements of
     this community of users have not been well served in the past
     because of RAWhoisd's performance problems.  We are pleased to
     report, however, that recent testing has shown Trawhoisd to be
     nearly two orders of magnitude faster than RAWhoisd! This
     performance speedup is realized by avoiding network delays, and by
     the fact that Trawhoisd is written is C rather than Perl, in which
     RAWhoisd is implemented (the database management scheme used in
     Perl is extremely slow).

     The current, centralized RAWhoisd server will remain available,
     with the ability to answer router configuration queries and support
     whois-type browsing of the IRR.  A beta version of Trawhoisd will
     be available soon; if you are interested in being a beta-tester,
     please send e-mail to merit-ie@merit.edu.  We appreciate your
     contribution!

     User consulting continues to be a priority for the RADB staff, with
     e- mail and telephone questions ranging from queries about RIPE
     syntax to requests for information about the RADB and its role in
     the Internet Routing Registry.  The database support team routinely
     provides step-by- step instructions for registering user policy in
     the RADB, writes scripts that allow users to accomplish desired
     routing registry tasks, offers online tutorials on key topics such
     as CIDR addressing and PGP encryption, and coordinates efforts
     among providers and other registries to ensure that appropriate
     policies are registered in the database.  To contact the RADB
     staff, send e-mail to db-admin@ra.net.

     Bill Norton has been named manager of Merit's Internet Engineering
     group.  In this role, he oversees evolving Routing Arbiter
     services, NANOG activities, and Merit's developing for-fee Route
     Server operational activities.  Norton also heads Merit's NetSCARF
     (Network Statistics Collection And Reporting Facility) project.  He
     came to Merit in 1988 to join the NSFNET project staff, and became
     the lead architect of network management solutions for the NSFNET
     and the Routing Arbiter Project.  On behalf of the Routing Arbiter,
     he led the initiative to deploy the first SNMPv2 agent in a
     production environment.

     Additional Internet Engineering projects include the GateD
     Consortium, which is led by Sue Hares, and a short-term project to
     provide routing engineering consultation for the Interim Defense
     Research and Engineering Network's (IDREN) new national backbone.
     This effort is led by Craig Labovitz.  Norton, Hares, and Labovitz
     now serve as the Internet Engineering group's leadership team.

     Labovitz and Masaki Hirabaru attended the 7th Maryland Workshop on
     Very High Speed Networks, sponsored by the Maryland Center for
     Telecommunications Research and the Department of Computer Science
     and Electrical Engineering at the University of Maryland Baltimore
     County.  The workshop brought together technical experts to discuss
     progress and research issues in the design and implementation of
     very high speed communication networks.  In October, Sue Hares
     taught sessions on host- based and backbone internetworking
     technology at a NATO Advanced Networking Workshop in St.
     Petersburg, Russia.

UCL
----

     UCL had a very interesting time running the Mbone and
     SoftwareVision transmission of the IEEE Globecom Conference - we
     made use of RAT and some novel tricks for linking up high bandwidth
     parts of the Internet (we were transmittign over IP on SMDS, ATM
     and while this was happing the London Internet exchange was
     upgraded to fast ether switching, which improved connectivity
     between the academic sites and the commercial ones enourmously). A
     report on the Mbone event (technology and setup and debugging mbone
     quality) is available from ftp://cs.ucl.ac.uk/darpa/GLOBECOM96-
