INTERNET MONTHLY REPORTS
------------------------

The purpose of these reports is to communicate to the Internet Research
Group the accomplishments, milestones reached, or problems discovered by
the participating organizations.

Each organization is expected to submit a 1/2 page report on the first
business day of the month describing the previous month's activities.
These reports should be submitted via network mail to "IMR@ISI.EDU".

The Internet Monthly Report mailing list is now managed by MajorDomo at
ISI.EDU.  The announcements of new issues on the Internet Monthly Report
are sent to the IETF-Announce list and to this IMR list.

Requests to be ADDED or DELETED from the Internet Monthly report list
should be sent to "majordomo@isi.edu" with the message body either
"subscribe imr" or "unsubscribe imr".

Details on obtaining the current IMR, or back issues, via FTP or EMAIL
may be obtained by sending an EMAIL message to "rfc-info@ISI.EDU" with
the message body "help: ways_to_get_imrs".  For example:

        To: rfc-info@ISI.EDU
        Subject: getting imrs

     IETF Monthly Report for May, 1996

     1. Let me remind everyone that the next IETF meeting will be in
     Montreal, Quebec, Canada from June 24-28, 1996. Logistic
     information has already been sent to the IETF announcement list and
     is, of course, available from the IETF Web Page and the IETF Shadow
     directories.

     Note that this is the same date as INET '96! While not a "joint"
     meeting per se, both meetings will be held in the Montreal
     Convention Center, and the IETF and INET'96 will permit attendees
     to attend each others' sessions (assuming space is available). See
     the IETF or ISOC Web Pages for more information.

     Closing out the year, the IETF will be returning to San Jose,
     California on December 9-13, 1996. Our local host for the San Jose
     meeting is Cisco Systems. We begin 1997 in Memphis, Tennessee where
     Federal Express will be the host. This meeting will be held April
     7-11, 1997. We are currently working on returning to Europe in
     August, 1997.

     Once all the arrangements have been made, notifications will be
     sent to the IETF Announcement list. Remember that information on
     future IETF meetings can be always be found in the file 0mtg-
     sites.txt which is located on the IETF shadow directories.  This
     information can also be viewed from the IETF Home Page on the Web.
     The URL is:

                      http://www.ietf.cnri.reston.va.us
                           or http://www.ietf.org

     2. The minutes of the IESG teleconferences have been publicly
     available on the IETF Shadow directories since 1991. These files
     are placed in the /ftp/iesg directory.

     I.  Significant Events

     During May 1996, InterNIC Registration Services assigned the
     following network addresses, and registered domain names to include
     top-level country domains:

                              Assigned    Registered   Country Domain(s)

     Network Addresses           4,126

     Domain Names Registered                  48,954

     Top-level Country Domain(s)                   2     LA - Vientiane
                                                         DJ - Djibouti

     Tom Newell attended Internet World in Los Angeles to meet with
     various agencies.  He collected information for an InterNIC trade
     show plan.

     Two CuSeeMe Focus Group meetings were conducted with members of the
     Research and Education (R&E) community.

     Completed the domain name Lame Delegation Policy issues.

     Completed the "NOTIFY" program to inform registrants that their
     domain name(s) were being deactivated.

     Updated Guardian/PGP on the internal/external World Wide Web (WWW)
     sites.

     In support of Guardian, the domain, host and contact registration
     template revisions were completed.

     Debbie Fuller was installed as the Manager of our Customer
     Complaints Research and Reports Section.

     Doug Armentrout was installed as the Domain Registration Section
     Manager.

     Voice phone lines and telephones have been installed for support
     staff to handle the increased calls to the InterNIC Receivables
     Section.  Increases are due to the distribution of the 15-day final
     domain name invoices.

     Completed and distributed the "15-Day Deactivation Notice" to over
     25,000 domain name holders.

     Completed testing the InterNIC's Receivables Section program for
     generating domain name renewal invoices.

     INTERNIC DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES

     As the number of information resources available on the Internet
     continues to increase, there has also been a substantial growth in
     the search tools available to help users find the particular
     information that interests them.  In May, InterNIC Directory and
     Database Services set up an online listing of search tools
     organized by type of search.  The listings include tools that help

     the net, tools that search for people by name, and various other
     search categories.

     THE US DOMAIN REGISTRY ======================

     Some of the processing of requests to the US Domain administrator
     is now automated.  In particular, most requests to register names
     in localities already delegated are automatically forwarded to the
     administrator for that locality.

     The US Domain administrator no longer makes direct registrations of
     hosts, and only makes delegations of third or fourth level domain
     names (such as localities).

     A new policy has been added to the criteria for delegating domain
     names under the US Domain:

             It is the intention that the delegation of third level
            (for example, locality) domain names be wide spread to
             many registries.  It is undesirable for one person or
             organization to manage a large part of the third level
             names in any particular geographic or logical area.

             No individual or organization shall have more than 500
             delegations total in the US Domain as a whole, or more
             than 50 delegation in any particuilar second level
             (for example, a state).

MERIT INTERNET ENGINEERING- May
-------------------------------

     This report summarizes May 1996 activities of Merit's Internet
     Engineering group on behalf of the Routing Arbiter (RA) service and
     other projects.

     Merit invites your participation in a new project--a continuation
     of the Internet data collection efforts initiated by Vern Paxson of
     Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.  In 1994-95, Paxson
     collected a large set of network endpoint measurements by running
     Network Probe Daemons (NPDs) at sites in the U.S., Asia, and
     Europe.  Traceroutes initiated by the probes revealed pathologies
     such as fluttering, midstream changes, loops, duplicate hops,
     premature hops, erroneous routing, and infrastructure failures.
     Merit's effort, which is being led by Dun Liu, will repeat Paxson's
     methodology for 1996.  The data will then be used to model Internet
     dynamics, identify portions of the network with high latency and

     packet loss, and measure the characteristics of Internet paths.
     Sites participating in the project will be asked to run the NPD
     software, which runs on any standard Unix system.  If you are
     interested in participating, please send e-mail to dunl@merit.edu.
     The NPD software is available from
     ftp://nic.merit.edu/routing.arbiter/tools/npd-1.0.tar.Z.  Your help
     is greatly appreciated!

     As a result of April and May's efforts to identify, check, and
     delete duplicated Route objects from the Routing Arbiter Database
     (RADB), more than 9,000 records have now been removed from the
     registry.  The deleted objects were either duplicated in another
     Internet Routing Registry database or covered by a shorter (less
     specific) aggregate object in the RADB.  Approximately 31,000 Route
     objects remain in the database.

     The Commercial Internet eXchange (CIX) hosted the seventh North
     American Network Operators' Group (NANOG) meeting in Washington,
     D.C. on May 30- 31.  Stan Barber of Academ Consulting Services has
     kindly made available a complete set of notes and slides from the
     meeting; they will soon be available through Merit's Web site,
     http://www.merit.edu/~nanog/.  Bill Norton of Merit moderated the
