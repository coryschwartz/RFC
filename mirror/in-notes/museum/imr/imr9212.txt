INTERNET RESEARCH REPORTS

INTERNET ENGINEERING REPORTS
----------------------------

     1. The next IETF meeting is scheduled for Columbus, Ohio from March
        29th through April 2, 1993 (yes, this does mean that the IESG
        Open Plenary will be held on April first). The meeting is being
        co-hosted by OARNet and The Ohio State University. There will be
        a registration reception on Sunday, March 28. Logistic and
        registration information will be forthcoming from the IETF
        Secretariat.

        The 27th meeting of the IETF, scheduled for July of 1993, will
        be held in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and will be co-hosted by
        SURFnet and RARE. This will be the first time an IETF meeting
        has been held outside of North America. Negotiations are still
        in progress for the meeting facilities and catering
        arrangements, and there will be a higher fee for this meeting
        (estimated to be at least $200). More information will be
        provided as it becomes available.

     2. After reviewing the increased intertwining of OSI activities
        with the work in the other areas, the IESG has decided to adjust
        the area boundaries to integrate most of the current OSI
        activities with the Applications and Internet areas. Dave
        Piscitello will join Phil Almquist and Stev Knowles as a co-
        director of the Internet Area, and Erik Huizer will join Russ
        Hobby as a co-director of the Applications Area. All of the
        current work in progress is continuting unchanged.

     3. The IESG issued 12 Last Calls to the IETF during the month of
        December, 1992:

           a. FTP-FTAM Gateway Specification <draft-slaski-ftpftam>

INTERNET PROJECTS
-----------------

BOLT BERANEK AND NEWMAN INC.
----------------------------

     InterDomain Policy Routing (IDPR)
     ---------------------------------

     During the past couple of months, we have been preparing the gated
     software for the IDPR pilot Internet installation planned for early
     1993.  This pilot installation involves three transit domains
     (including NSF and NASA) and four source domains.  Transit policies
     will be set by the participating transit domains.

     During the pilot installation, only that traffic designated as IDPR
     will be handled by IDPR.  Regular production traffic traversing the
     participating domains will not be affected by the pilot
     installation.  Moreover, none of the existing routers within any of
     the participating domains requires IDPR software.  Sun workstations
     will act as policy gateways for the participating domains.  Each
     source domain will have at least one policy gateway associated with
     it, and each transit domain will have two policy gateways
     associated with it.

     The pilot installation will have both an experimentation component
     (reconfiguration of policies and observation of the resulting
     effect on the IDPR traffic) and a field trial component (allowing
     IDPR to run uninterrupted for several weeks).  At the conclusion of
     the pilot, we will be publishing the results as an Internet Draft.

     Preparation for the pilot involves modifying the gated software in
     three ways:

     (1) Add support for source policies, so that sources can request
         routes with specific characteristics and so that route servers
         can generate such routes.

     (2) Permit multiple policy gateways to reside in a single router.
         The policy gateways acting on behalf of the three transit
         domains will reside on the FIXes.  There will be one router per
         FIX, which will act as a set of policy gateways on behalf of
         the three participating transit domains.

     (3) Add the ability to collect selected protocol trace information
         for post-processing.  The pilot installation will be in place
         for several weeks, and hence we need to be able to accurately
         track its performance.

     BBN and SRI together have already added the source policy
     capabilities to the gated software.  We, at BBN, have successfully
     tested the new source policy software on a set of workstations in
     our test lab.  Currently, we are in the process of making the
     necessary software modifications to permit multiple policy gateways
     to coexist in a single router.

     Scaleability Project (aka Project 10^4)
     ---------------------------------------

     Over the past months, BBN has been examining the problems and
     possible solutions associated with large-scale geographically-
     distributed real-time simulations.  To date, such simulations have
     been limited to approximately 1000 simulated entities by the
     network load imposed by the current method of data distribution to
     simulation sites, which involves all traffic being sent to every
     participant.  The simulation community wishes to handle 10^4 entity
     real-time simulations by 1995, and 10^5 entity simulations by the
     year 2000.  The gap between current practice and these goals led to
     the creation of this project.

     The project is developing a toolset for investigating application
     and networking behaviors, and for evaluating new algorithms and
     techniques for better utilizing the long-haul network.  The toolset
     includes a simulation simulator, which uses a modified SAF (Semi-
     Autonomous Forces) simulator to generate simulation traffic
     representing 10,000 entities at a variety of sites, over the course
     of a several-hour exercise; a "scaler" component, which serves as a
     test harness to evaluate various compression and data distribution
     techniques; and a modular, medium-resolution, flow-level network
     simulator, which allows evaluation of various multicast
     technologies, network topologies, and routing and congestion
     algortihms, as well as the evaluation of the effects of application
     scaling algorithms on network traffic and performance.

     Several successful demos of the preliminary scaleability toolset
     were given during November, using a network topology based on the
     current Defense Simulation Internet (DSInet), and a hypothetical
     future DSI based on T3 backbones.

CONCERT
-------


     MCNC held it's second Packet Video Workshop on December 9th and
     10th.  This was a workshop intended for those involved with Packet
     Video from product development, planning, installation, management
     and analysis points of view.  Over 125 representatives of industry,
     government, and research institutions from around the Internet
     attended. The workshop was sponsored by the Packet Video
     Consortium, the National Science Foundation and MCNC. The workshop
     was broadcast over the Internet using IVS and NV for video and VAT
     for audio.

     CONCERT staff members participated with staff from the NSF, LBL,
     ISI and Xerox PARC in giving a demonstration to a representative of
     the Clinton-Gore transition team showing the current capabilities
     of videoconferencing over the Internet.  A multipoint
     videoconference among the above groups was held using VAT and NV.

CSUNET (THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY NETWORK)
-----------------------------------------------

     In November, the California State University Network (CSUNET)
     agreed with the San Diego SuperComputer Center Network (SDSCNET) to
     install a T-1 multiplexer at the SDSC center to enable the
     institutions to share SDSC's nationwide supercomputer center
     videoconferencing channel.  SDSCNET has a 384 Kbps fractional T-1
     from MCNC in North Carolina to San Diego.

     The existing T-1 between CSUNET and SDSCNET will carry both video
     and TCP/IP Internet bound traffic.  As part of the agreement,
     CSUNET will be installing a gateway at SDSCNET to peer with the
     ENSS at San Diego.

     In December, CSUNET improved its dialup CSUNET access ports (CAPS)
     software.  The new features allow better call monitoring and
     control.  The gateway from X.25 to TELNET has also been upgraded
     for better security and call tracking.

     Because of the improvements to CAPS, CSUNET has connected AppleTalk
     Remote Access (ARA) servers which are available for use by CSU
     Chancellor's office staff.  CSU campuses are investigating
     installation of similar services to provide their faculty with
     remote access at their homes.

     A new SLIP service using the CAPS dialup service has been installed
     which allows remote IP access from any CSU campus CAPS dialup pool.
     The service uses SLIP software on CSUNET's Telematics X.25 network
     to route the SLIP connection to an X.25/IP router.

NSFNET/ANSNET BACKBONE ENGINEERING
----------------------------------

     Network Status Summary
     ======================

     Following the T1 backbone disconnection on Dec. 2nd, the T3 is now
     supporting all NSFNET services.  A 2nd ethernet interface was
     installed in ENSS136 to support interim connectivity to the MAE-
     East facility.  The former T1 backbone class B address (129.140)
     was returned to the NIC.  CA*Net peer router hardware
     reconfigurations will be completed in January to allow direct T3
     network peering.  A plan has been developed to dismantle and remove
     the RT routers at regional sites.

     Following the software changes resulting from instabilities
     observed during the MBONE multicasts in November, the T3 backbone
     routing stability has been very good in December.  Daily reports
     are now generated on internal and external peer network routing
     stability.

     Seven new RS960 FDDI interfaces were installed on ENSS nodes in
     December.  Reliability and performance of the FDDI hardware has
     been very good.

     Backbone Traffic and Routing Statistics
     =======================================

     The total inbound packet count for the T3 Backbone (measured using
     SNMP interface counters) was 22,009,352,089 up 5.0% from November.

     As of December 31, the number of networks configured in the NSFNET
     Policy Routing Database was 8561 for the T3 backbone. Of these,
     1760 were never announced to the T3 backbone.  The maximum number
     of networks announced to the T3 backbone during the month (from
     samples collected every 15 minutes) was 6187.  Average announced
     networks on 12/31 were 6154.

     Previously when the T1 Backbone was operational the overall average
     number of networks announced via the primary configured AS path was
     around 88%. Since the T1 Backbone was dismantled this average has
     gone to around 95%. Graphs of this information are available for
     anonymous ftp on merit.edu, in pub/nsfnet/offnet, as postscript
     files.

     Routing Software and Stability on the T3 Network
     ================================================

     Higher than usual MBONE activity in November resulted in exterior
     routing instabilities and routing instability internal to ANSnet.
     Following the immediate corrective actions that were taken in
     November, a number of software changes were made in December.
     Changes to the RS960 microcode and efficiency improvements in the
     routing software have resulted in improved ANSnet internal routing
     stability (regardless of the presence of external route flapping).
     The MBONE participants have made changes to route MBONE traffic
     over the T3 backbone whenever possible, resulting in improved
     routing stability within certain US regional networks.

     Detailed reports of internal ANSnet and external peer network
     routing instabilities are now generated on a daily basis.  The
     ANSnet internal report attempts to summarize outages based on
     number and duration of the IBGP disconnects.  The program that
     generates this report looks at IBGP disconnects in a short time
     window.  It tries to assign the outage to the node with the most
     disconnects, and then eliminate all disconnects on other machines
     associated with that router.  If after eliminating disconnects
     related to the router assigned to the outage, more disconnects
     remain in the same time window, the process is repeated, assigning
     secondary and tertiary responsibility for the outage and so on
     until all disconnects are accounted for.  The time window is
     extended to cover all disconnects that are not separated by more
     than a five minute period in which there is no change to internal
     routing in the network.

     Using this method, data sufficient to generate reports on internal
     ANSnet routing stability has been collected continuously since
     October reported 99.0% internal routing stability (no changes to
     internal routing).  These two nodes reported 98.9% stability,
     mostly due to a problem early in December.  Most nodes reported
     99.0% to 99.5% stability.  Two reported better than 99.5%
     stability.  The vast majority of this instability is due to the
     regular configuration updates and scheduled maintenance.  With the
     dismantling of the T1 backbone, activities are underway to reduce
     the duration of time required to process the bi-weekly router
     configuration runs, and scheduled maintenance.

     Similar data on external routing stability has been collected
     continuously since December '92.  The external routing stability
     reports will record an external route which is withdrawn from the
     ANSnet due to: (1) an EGP route timing out (not being advertised by
     an external peer), (2) an explicit BGP unreachable received from an
     external peer, (3) the loss of an external EGP or BGP session that

Internet Monthly Report                                    December 1992


     is not accompanied by loss of internal IBGP sessions.  Excluded are
     the following cases: (1) we do not observe changes in the next hop
     at the ENSS, (2) the route is replaced by another route on the same
     ENSS, (3) a route is lost and backed up by another route on the
     same ENSS, (4) connectivity is lost due to ANSnet internal problems
     (e.g.  configuration runs or other).  Some of this data has already
     been shared with specific regional networks to get feedback.  In
     January, these reports will be fully automated and distributed to
     peer networks which are advertising networks that are withdrawing
     reachability excessively (e.g. exhibiting great instability).

     After the recent FIX-East reconfiguration, a bug in rcp_routed was
     observed that would result in an ENSS installing a route locally
     that had previously been advertsized by a peer, where the route was
     rejected on the ENSS due to policy constraints (no NACR request).
     Such a route would incorrectly be installed on the ENSS (but not
     advertised) when the destination becomes completely unreachable.
     On ENSS136, the existence of multiple peers coupled with the use of
     default routing by some peers could form a routing loop when this
     occurs.  This problem in the rcp_routed software has been corrected
     and is deployed on ENSS136.  Deployment of the same changes across
     the rest of the ANSnet is scheduled for early January.

     Another planned change to rcp_routed in January involves fixing the
     metric_in function for EGP.  This will allow regional peer routers
     to be able to have an EGP session with the same ENSS on two
     different interfaces (FDDI and ethernet) and prefer the FDDI via
     metrics.

     RS960 FDDI Deployment Status
     ============================

     During the month of December, we installed RS960 FDDI adapters at
     the following 7 locations: Boston (E134), Argonne (E130), FIX-E
     (E145), Houston (E139), Ithaca (E133), FIX-W (E144), Seattle
     (E143).

     Domain Name Service for ANSnet
     ==============================

     In December, ANS made two adjustments to the DNS administration of
     the ANS backbone.  First, the "t3.nsf.net" domain was renamed to
     "t3.ans.net", and second, we added geographical designators to all
     CNSS nodes.  ENSS names were not changed other than in being moved
     to the "t3.ans.net" domain. The following excerpt of a traceroute
     from ANS Elmsford to Merit in Ann Arbor illustrates the ANSnet DNS
     conventions.

     While every effort was taken to ensure the accuracy of the DNS
     data, typos and glitches may have crept in.  If you notice any
     problems, please report them by sending mail to hostmaster@ans.net.

     OSI Support on T3 Backbone
     ==========================

     In early December, OSI CLNP forwarding over the T3 backbone was
     configured via encapsulation of CLNP over IP packets using the EON
     method (RFC1070) until native CLNP switching services are available
     on the T3 routers.

     One RT from the T1 NSS node at each midlevel/peer site is being
     used for the EON encapsulation function. It is our intention to
     keep this RT and one other for statistics collection purposes
     running at each site.

     CA*Net Reconfiguration Status
     =============================

     CA*Net is working with Merit and ANS to complete their plan to
     change their connections to the US (at Seattle, Ithaca and
     Princeton) so that the US nodes will run the CA*Net RT kernel and

     become logically part of the Canadian routing domain. This project
     has not yet been completed, and so currently the three NSS nodes
     from the T1 Backbone (but without the T1 circuits) are being used
     to route traffic between CA*Net and NSFNET. Once the software
     installation is complete the circuits will be moved over to these
     RTs and the full NSS noes will be disabled.

     AIX 3.2 Migration Plan
     ======================

     System testing continued in December for the new AIX 3.2 operating
     system for the RS/6000 routers.  This software will be installed on
     the T3 test network in January for final system testing prior to
     deployment in early February.

     GATED Routing Software Development
     ==================================

     Work continued on the development of GATED as replacement for
     rcp_routed software on the T3 backbone.  The same Interior Gateway
     Protocol (IGP) used by rcp_routed will be supported initially on
     GATED as a transitional measure to simplify the deployment of
     GATED.  Full IS-IS integrated routing will follow in GATED, along
     with BGP4 with CIDR routing capability.

     Cisco PROM Upgrade on ANSNET
     ============================

     We are finalizing tests that will allow us to upgrade the software
     level on all ANSnet Cisco routers to 9.0(3).  This will fix several
     bugs that currently exist on the current 8.3.X that is installed
     across the network.

NSFNET/INFORMATION SERVICES
---------------------------

     The Merit/NSFNET Regional Techs meeting will be held in Boulder,
     Colorado, January 21 and 22.  The conference will convene at US
     WEST's Advanced Technologies Conference Center in the University of
     Colorado's Research Park.  NCAR and WestNet will also be hosting
     sessions and activities.  The focus of the seminar is operational
     planning over the next 6-8 months: CIDR implementation will be
     discussed by Vince Fuller of BARRNET and Dan Long of NEARNET will
     give an overview of CIDR address allocation strategies; GIX, NAPS,
     and Route Servers will be presented by Elise Gerich of Merit to
     increase the understanding of the Internet routing implications of
     Network Access Points (NAPS) technology as proposed by NSF.  The
     current status of the NSFNET network and the transition to the
     "Next Generation NSFNET" will also be addressed.  Requests for the
     detailed agenda and additional information may be sent to nsf-
     seminar@merit.edu.

     "Making Your Internet Connection Count: Technology, Tools &
     Resources" will be held in San Francisco, CA, March 15-16.  Hosted
     by BARRNET, the Merit Networking Seminar is a comprehensive forum
     intended for beginning and intermediate network users focusing on
     issues of interest to educators, librarians, campus computing
     leaders, information systems and networking administrators, and
     educational liaisons.  Nationally known experts will discuss
     network resources, getting connected, and how the network is
     effectively being used today by universities, research
     organizations, libraries, and public schools.  An overview of the
     Internet, its tools and resources, and the national policies that
     affect its growth will also be presented.

     A three-hour hands-on tutorial will be held in conjunction with the
     seminar at Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA.  Merit staff will

     activities were reviewed, acknowledging the increasing awareness
     and role of user services in the Internet world.  The CAUSE 92
     Preconference, sponsored by the Coalition for Networked Information
     (CNI) was held December 1 in Dallas, Texas.  With emphasis on
     "Navigating and Navigators: Research and Development in
     Navigational Tools and Services for the Internet," Laura Kelleher
     of Merit/NSFNET Information Services, presented a study on what is
     being used on the Internet as well as participating in several
     discussions of Internet tools and resources.  Kelleher also
     "cruised" the Internet with the members of the Southeastern
     Michigan Library Association at Oakland University, MI.

PITTSBURGH SUPERCOMPUTING CENTER
--------------------------------

     Since our last report, the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center
     accepted delivery of the CRAY Y-MP C90, the newest and most
     powerful supercomputing system produced by Cray Research, Inc., the
     Minnesota-based firm that has supplied most of the supercomputing
     systems in use around the world. The PSC is the first non-
     government site in the U.S. to receive the new system.  The C90
     features 16 connected processing units, each of which is capable of
     performing a billion calculations a second, so that peak speed is
     16 billion calculations a second -- six times faster than Cray's
     current top-of-the-line system, the Y-MP/8, which the C90 will
     replace. It comes configured with 256 million words, (2 billion
     bytes) of memory, eight times that of the Y-MP/8, and will be
     upgraded to 512 million words sometime this year.

     Under the proposal for the National Machineroom Metacenter, the
     National Science Foundation Centers are specializing within the
     general class of massively parallel processors in order to provide
     both large machines and good vendor coverage for use by the
     community.  We at the PSC are planning our major activity with the
     CRAY MPP: T3D, while NCSA will make a major thrust with the
     Thinking Machine Corporation's CM-5.  TMC found a need for the CM-5
     that we have had for the past year; and because of this, we have
     taken it out of service. To that end, we have already begun to work
     on applications using the T3D Emulator Software.

     In November, Matt Mathis and Gene Hastings of our communications
     group attended the IETF meetings in Washington, DC.  Matt chairs
     the BGP Deployment working group and Gene chairs the Network Status
     Reports and Network Joint Management groups.

SAN DIEGO SUPERCOMPUTER CENTER
--------------------------------

     SDSC Network Activities
     =======================

     During the month we made two major changes to our LAN.  The DMZ
     Ethernet was changed from a subnet of our Class B address (132.249)
     to its own Class C address (198.17.47.) At the same time, the
     Center's FDDI ring was split in two.  This gives us an FDDI DMZ.
     Its Class C address is 198.17.46.
