     submitter.

Each organization is expected to submit a 1/2 page report on the first
business day of the month describing the previous month's activities.

These reports should be submitted via network mail to:

     Ann Westine Cooper (Cooper@ISI.EDU)

     NSF Regional reports - To obtain the procedure describing how to
     submit information for the Internet Monthly Report, send an email
     message to mailserv@is.internic.net and put "send imr-procedure" in
     the body of the message (add only that one line; do not put a
     signature).

Requests to be added or deleted from the Internet Monthly report list
should be sent to "imr-request@isi.edu".

     Details on obtaining the current IMR, or back issues, via FTP or
     EMAIL may be obtained by sending an EMAIL message to "rfc-
     info@ISI.EDU" with the message body "help: ways_to_get_imrs".  For
     example:

                   IETF Monthly REPORT for January, 1994

     1. The 29th meeting of the IETF will be held in Seattle, Washington
        from March 28 through April 1, 1994. This meeting is being
        hosted by NorthWestNet and the University of Washington. The
        registration reception will be held Sunday evening, March 27th,
        beginning at 6 PM. The first wave of announcements have already
        been sent out by the IETF Secretariat.

        Information on future IETF meetings can be always be found in
        the file 0mtg-sites.txt which is located on the IETF shadow
        directories.

     2. There is a new question on the IETF Meeting Registration Form.
        As an experiment, the Secretariat will be working on an
        electronic version of the meeting proceedings in addition to the
        printed version. Meeting attendees must explicitly state whether
        they want to receive a hardcopy version of the proceedings.
        REMEMBER: This is an EXPERIMENT (the first time an electronic
        version is being attempted).

     3. The IESG approved or recommended the following five Protocol
        Actions during the month of January, 1994:

        o  RFC 1408 (Telnet Environment Option) has been reclassified
           as Historic.

        o  The OSPF NSSA Option as a Proposed Standard.

        o  TN3270 Current Practices be published as an Informational
           RFC.

        o  Extensions to RIP to Support Demand Circuits as a Proposed
           Standard.

        o  Protocol Analysis for Extensions to RIP to Support Demand
           Circuits be published as an Informational RFC.


     4. The IESG issued five Last Calls to the IETF during the month of
        January, 1994:

        o  Definitions of Managed Objects for the SONET/SDH Interface
           Type <draft-ietf-atommib-sonet-04> for consideration as a

INTERNET PROJECTS

ANSNET/NSFNET BACKBONE ENGINEERING
----------------------------------


     Network Status Summary
     ======================

     Routing software changes were made to work around problems due to
     increased memory utilization associated with forwarding table
     growth on ANSnet.  This is a temporary workaround pending the
     deployment of gated routing software on ANSnet in early February.
     Following the completion of the phase-5 upgrade in December,
     overall T3 network stability increased to a 12 month high in
     January '94.  Overall Internet stability (as measured by external
     route flapping) continued to decrease in January.


     January Backbone Traffic and Routing Statistics
     ===============================================

     The total inbound packet count for the T3 network (measured using
     SNMP interface counters) was 45,786,027,182 on T3 ENSS interfaces,
     down 0.5% from December.  The total packet count into the network
     including all ENSS serial interfaces was 53,834,709,296 up 2.9%
     from December.  The maximum number of destinations announced to the
     T3 network during January was 16,281 up 9.9% from December.  The
     number of network destinations configured for announcement to the
     T3 network but were never announced (silent nets) during January
     was 5,462.


     Rcp_routed Routing Software Changes
     ===================================

     Paging problems experienced due to memory used for route computa-
     tion began to appear on other ENSS.  Previously this problem had
     only been observed on ENSS136 (11 external peers).  Changes to
     rcp_routed software were deployed to reduce memory usage and avoid
     a problem where router memory allocation for route download spooling
     could cause page thrashing.  Release notes are available for
     anonymous ftp at ftp.ans.net:/pub/info/t3-rcp_routed/Release-Notes.

     Routing Stability Measured on the T3 Network
     ============================================

     Internal routing stability measurements are made by monitoring
     short term disconnect times (disconnects of five minutes duration
     or less).  This is intended as a measure of overall system
     stability rather than complete connectivity.  January showed a
     considerable improvement over past months:

            August               97.5%                      97.9%
            September            98.1%                      98.5%

            January              98.7%                       N/A

     The node that contributed to the most instability in January was
     ENSS134 due to two consecutive days in which that node suffered
     from memory page thrashing (rcp_routed problem discussed above).
     This was followed by E205, a customer site which agreed to be used
     for early deployment of gated routing software.  This node was
     switched between rcp_routed and gated software a number of times to
     test gated.  The node ENSS177 had numerous power problems and one
     other node, ENSS133, experienced over one hour of instability.  For
     most nodes, January was very stable, with only 13 nodes reporting
     more than 30 minutes of instability and 28 nodes reporting over 15
     minutes.  This histogram of overall stability recorded by each node
     over the last 12 months is as follows:

     There has been steady increase in route flaps associated with
     external networks over the course of the last 12 months.  The
     measurement method is described in:

     This report measures overall Internet stability associated with the
     number of times networks are announced as unreachable.  The
     following represents the monthly totals in terms of number of
     networks declared unreachable per hour during the last 12 months.

     External Internet route flapping increased to a new monthly high in
     January.  Three destinations were announced as unreachable over
     5,000 times (1 US).  Another 8 destinations were announced as
     unreachable over 1,000 times (4 US).  Another 179 destinations were
     announced as unreachable over 500 times (72 US).  Another 1045
     destinations were announced as unreachable 100 times or more (250

     Destinations announced through multiple peer networks are usually
     counted once for each peer AS over which it is declared unreachable
     when connectivity is lost (this is generally the case except when a
     single peer transit provider loses connectivity).

     There were 31 AS paths announcing over 5,000 networks as
     unreachable and 29 AS paths sending over 1,000 updates containing
     unreachables.  These were:

     Gated BGP4/CIDR Deployment Update
     =================================

     We are expecting to deploy gated/BGP4 on the first AS690 router
     (ENSS205) in early February.  The BGP code is quite stable and has
     been running on AS1133 routers since early December and we do not

Internet Monthly Report                                     January 1994


     expect many problems with it.  The IGP interoperability between the
     two routing daemons (rcp_routed and gated) has been harder to get
     working correctly.

     Once the ENSS205 router is stabilized on gated, our next step will
     be to deploy gated/BGP4 on ENSS160, ENSS131 (Ann Arbor) and a CNSS
     (yet to be chosen) that supports HSSI interfaces and FDDI.  We plan
     to burn the code in for a few days and if successful, deploy this
     further on ENSS136, and possibly ENSS139.

     Once we have the gated code deployed on these AS690 routers that
     represent the most complex configurations we need to support, the
     rest of the AS690 deployment should go quickly.  Once the AS690
     deployment is complete, we could expect BGP4 peers of AS690 to
     start to withdraw the more specific routes which are represented by
     the aggregates that they are announcing.

     We are working with Merit on a tool that would allow us to monitor
     which more specific class-based routes (that are represented by
     announced aggregates) are getting withdrawn on a weekly basis.  We
     hope this will allow us to debug any connectivity problems that are
     reported, which may be correlated to CIDR transition.

     Defense Simulation Internet

     The Defense Simulation Internet (DSI) has grown to over 80 sites.
     All operational user sites are now running the ST-II protocol on
     the unclassified side of the network.  ST 1.5 is being phased out
     of the secure side of the network as well.

Internet Monthly Report                                     January 1994


     An upgrade to the backbone is planned for February.  Capacity will
     be doubled to 3 Mbps.

     The DSI supported a major demonstration at the end of November at
     the Interservice/Industry Training Systems and Education Conference
     (I/ITSEC).  At this conference, simulators in the United States
     interacted with simulators from Britain using the DSI and ISDN
     circuits to connect the three sites in Britain.  In addition, four
     Department of Defense Dependent Schools (in Germany, Korea, and the
     United States) were connected into the DSI and ran a number of
     demonstrations, using both the ST-II and IP protocols.

     Inter-Domain Policy Routing

     During the month of December, we continued our laboratory testing
     of IDPR multicast and multipath routing.  We also integrated the
     IDPR kernel with mrouted so that we can use IP multicast for
     intra-domain multicasting and IDPR for inter-domain multicasting.
     During January, we moved our testing onto DARTnet.

     Scalability

     Under its Defense Simulation Internet (DSI) Engineering contract
     from ARPA (ASTO), BBN is tasked to study the issue of "scalability"
     from the perspective of network performance and functionality.  The
     Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) user community has
     ambitious goals for dramatically increasing the scale of simulated
     war-fighting exercises.  While the largest exercises to date have
     involved less than 1000 "entities" (tanks, planes, ships, etc.),
     planned future exercises may involve as many as 100,000.  Changes
     to both the DIS applications and the supporting network(s) will be
     necessary to accommodate this growth.

     During December and January, work progressed on two fronts.
     Statistics were collected at two Synthetic Theater of War (STOW)
     Engineering Demonstrations and in combination with statistics from
     demonstrations at November's Industry/Interservice Training,
     Simulation and Education Conference (I/ITSEC) are being analyzed in
     order to characterize DIS network traffic and DSI performance.
     Significant progress was made in enhancing the DSI network
     simulator.

     In December, network traffic and performance statistics were
     collected during the first of several Synthetic Theater of War
     (STOW) Engineering Demonstrations.  The DSI statistics collection
     was coordinated with the STOW participants in order to enable
     correlation between performance measurements and events within the
     virtual battle.  High frequency collections were done at several

     points.  First, for measurement of raw throughput, SNMP was used to
     collect counts of packets and bytes entering and leaving router
     interfaces on both the secure and unclassified subnets.  Similar
     statistics were collected from trunk interfaces on the Wideband
     Packet Switches that make up the wide area backbone of the DSI.
     Secondly, for measurement of performance specific to participating
     hosts and war-fighting entities (multiples of these can be
     generated by a single host), TCPdump was run on site-resident
     workstations to collect full traces of simulator update traffic.
     Thirdly, a special-purpose ping-like program was run among NTP-
     synchronized, site-resident hosts to measure LAN-to-LAN delay every
     second.  The simulation participants at NRaD also collected
     statistics, and it is likely that we will be combining our data
     with theirs for cooperative analysis.  In January, another small-
     scale STOW exercise was held involving only constructive
     simulators, and statistics were collected during this experiment,
     as well. The data are currently being analyzed, and preliminary
     results should be available soon.  Unfortunately, much of the data
     is classified, but the possibility of declassification is being
     explored.

     It is expected that initial analysis will consist primarily of
     traffic characterization and network performance measurement.  More
     advanced analysis will follow, whose objectives will include
     estimation of the benefits to be gained by various approaches to
     multicast routing when combined with sophisticated application-
     level filtering algorithms.

     The DSI network simulator is part of the Scalability Toolset being
     built in cooperation with Loral Advanced Distributed Simulation
     (LADS).  The network simulator is operational and is being used to
     model network loading that would result from sample STOW scenarios
     being generated at LADS.  During December and January, we added
     real-time statistics display and menu options for file handling.
     The simulator is also being equipped with a graphical user
     interface for easy editing and configuration of the topology of the
     modeled network.  In January, an interim release was provided to
     the "beta test site," Lincoln Lab.  This release includes real-time
     display of network statistics and a load/save feature for ease in
     bringing up previously stored topologies.  Additional progress has
     been made since then on various cosmetic attributes of the display
     and tool palette.

     Real-Time Multicast Applications and Communications

     In the fall, we reported on the development of several new network
     services -- anycast, multi-level data flows, shared streams, and
     resource coordination objects.  During the past few months,

       o A paper describing Resource Coordination Objects was distributed
         to the community and made available for anonymous FTP from
         clynn.bbn.com as pub/docs/RCOs.ps).

       o Some of the multicast features developed under this project have
         been passed on to ISI for integration into the standard DARTnet
         kernel.  This includes low-level features supporting resource
         coordination objects (RCOs) and multi-level data flows.

       o We have modified the Video Information Server (VIS) to use three
         of new network services developed under the Multipoint/Realtime
         Communications project -- anycast, shared streams (built using
         Resource Coordination Objects (RCOs), and multi-level data flows.

     The bulk of recent efforts have been involved in the last task.
     BBN's Video Information Server (VIS) can operate over wide-area
     networks using only standard TCP and UDP mechanisms plus IP
     multicasting.  Part of the work involved considering how these new
     services affect the design and efficiency of wide-area network
     multimedia applications.  We have compared the use of traditional
     and novel network services in two areas related to the VIS: use of
     distributed catalogs of video information, and digital delivery of
     audio and video data.

     ANYCAST
     -------

     Introduction

     Anycasting provides a way to locate one of a set of supposedly
     equivalent network resources.  It differs from multicasting in that
     a multicast datagram is delivered to *every* listener, while an
     anycast datagram is delivered to *typically one* of a group of
     listeners: the "best" one according to some criterion.

     The Video Registry

     The Video Registry is an anycast-based service through which video
     applications can locate video resources.  It consists of a trivial
     relational database with a TCP-based query interface, a location
     server that responds to anycast requests for the nearest registry,
     and a multicast-based mechanism for redistributing locally-known



Cooper                                                         [Page 15]

Internet Monthly Report                                     January 1994


     resources to other registries.

     A video resource (for example, a catalog server that lists
     available video clips) sends an anycast UDP datagram to locate the
     nearest video registry.  At most one registry responds with a
     unicast UDP datagram containing the registry's IP address.  Said
     resource then opens a TCP connection to that address and sends a
     request to register itself.  Every 5 minutes or so, each registry
     multicasts to all other registries all of the resources it knows
     from local registration requests.  It also immediately announces
     newly registered resources.  Remotely registered resources not
     heard about for 20 minutes are dropped.

     A client application locates a registry in the same way, connects
     to it, and issues a query for all the video resources of a certain
     class.  The registry returned locally-registered resources first,
     followed by remotely registered ones.  New functions in VideoLib
     make it relatively simple for both client and server applications
     to use the registry.

     Vlens Without Anycasting

     One client application that uses the video registry is vlens, which
     displays a list of video clips that match supplied keywords, then
     allows the user to view any clip in the list.  The search itself is
     performed on behalf of vlens by various video servers; vlens can
     locate these servers using two methods: multicast-based or
     anycast-based.

     Each video server has a WAIS server that exports one or more video
     catalogs (BBN's video server currently exports 11 catalogs).  In
     addition, each video server has a multicast catalog-query manager.

     By default, vlens uses IP multicast queries.  Each time the user
     enters some keywords, vlens sends out a couple of multicast query
     datagrams containing the keywords plus a globally-unique
     identifier.  The catalog-query managers receive these datagrams and
     forward the query to their corresponding WAIS server (running on
     the same host).  If a WAIS server returns any valid matches, the
     catalog-query manager sends a response datagram to the multicast
     originator saying, in effect, "I have a valid response to your
     query ID #<such-and-such>."  Queries are idempotent; subsequently
     received query datagrams with the same identifier elicit an
     immediate retransmission of the above reply.

     After transmitting its queries, the client application sits back
     and awaits replies.  After a time, it iterates through the list of
     replies, opening a TCP connection to each of the responding query



Cooper                                                         [Page 16]

Internet Monthly Report                                     January 1994


     managers and saying, "Send me your responses to my query ID
     #<such-and-such>."  Each response takes the form of a one-line EDL
     file, which vlens simply concatenates for display to the user.

     Vlens With Anycasting

     The above scheme is simple to implement, and takes good advantage
     of the parallelism inherent in multiple catalog servers.
     Nevertheless, it is obviously non-deterministic, and in practice
     tends to be noticeably unreliable.  The alternative anycast-based
     search mechanism, enabled by running "vlens -anycast", works rather
     differently.

     When first started in anycast mode, vlens uses anycast to locate
     the nearest Video Registry.  It then opens a TCP connection to the
     registry and gets a list of all resources of class "WAIScatalog".

     Vlens then iterates through this list, contacting each WAIS server
     at the given address and port.  It forms a query to the INFO
     database asking for all ".src" files, which in turn identify all
     available databases; it retrieves these into a subdirectory of
     /tmp.  At this point vlens is ready for user input; it then takes
     each user query and sends it in turn to each of the available
     databases, collecting up to 250 total responses.

     SHARED STREAMS
     --------------

     Introduction

     A Shared Stream is a bandwidth reservation shared by multiple
     transmitters.  A conventional bandwidth reservation is made when a
     single transmitter requests absolute priority use of a specified
     number of bits per second between two specified network endpoints
     (Note that "absolute priority use" is not the same thing as
     "exclusive use.")  If another transmitter makes a similar request,
     it receives a separate allocation from that of the first
     transmitter.

     Nevertheless, in some circumstances (such as a floor-controlled
     videoconference) the second transmitter doesn't really need a
     separate allocation, because it will never transmit at the same
     time as the first transmitter.  Shared Streams are a way for other
     transmitters to request access to the same stream already allocated
     for the first transmitter, with the promise that their total
     combined transmitted bandwidth will somehow be limited to the
     original allocation.

Internet Monthly Report                                     January 1994


     Registering a Shared Stream

     BBN's implementation of Shared Streams works as follows:

     - The first transmitter sends the Resource Reservation Daemon
       (RRD) a FlowSpec detailing its bandwidth requirements.
     - If the reservation succeeds, the RRD returns a Resource
       CoordinationObject (RCO) ID, which consists of an IP address
       followed by 32 additional bits.
     - Subsequent transmitters send their local RRDs the same
       FlowSpec plus the RCO ID returned to the first transmitter.

     Video clients that use shared streams first agree on an alias by
     which the RCO ID will be known when it becomes available.  The
     first client to obtain the RCO ID registers it in the video
     registry under the agreed-upon alias.  Later clients retrieve it
     under the same alias.  When the originator closes down its stream,
     it unregisters the alias.

     Shared Streams in XIO

     We modified the XIO program, which transmits and receives JPEG-
     compressed video and mu-law audio, to support shared streams.  When
     invoked as "xio -t -ptt -join <stream name>" argument, the XIO
     transmitter interacts with the RRD and video registry, as described
     above, before each connection attempt.  To create a suitable
     FlowSpec, XIO derives a conservative estimate of its bandwidth
     requirements from the initial settings for picture size, inter-
     frame delay, and quantization factor.

     The "-ptt" flag causes the XIO transmitter to display a Push-To-
     Talk (PTT) button; it transmits audio and video only while that
     button is depressed.  For our demonstration, we run XIO at three
     separate DARTnet sites with at least one common segment across
     which two streams must flow.  Videoconference participants take
     turns depressing their PTT buttons, multicasting their image and
     voice to all participants.

     MULTI-LEVEL DATA FLOWS
     ----------------------

     Introduction

     A multi-level data flow is an unreliable transmission in which the
     transmitter tags each datagram with its importance to the overall
     information transfer.  For example, in a pyramid-encoded video
     transmission the low-frequency data, which gives the overall shape
     of the image, is more important than the high-frequency data, which



Cooper                                                         [Page 18]

Internet Monthly Report                                     January 1994


     fills in details.  Faced with inadequate bandwidth, intermediate
     gateways would discard the less-important datagrams first.

     In the video server, we chose to demonstrate two-level video
     transmission.  Because we do not have a pyramid encoder, we chose
     to transmit a low-resolution image with audio, and a high-
     resolution image without audio.  A receiver requesting a low-
     bandwidth transmission would receive a complete, but small, picture
     with audio.  A receiver requesting a high-bandwidth transmission
     would receive both streams, displaying a large image from the
     high-resolution stream with the audio from the low-resolution
     stream.

     Multi-level Flows in XIO

     We modified the XIO program to support multi-level flows.  Given
     the "-subflows" argument, XIO will transmit and receive audio and
     video in one or two hierarchical subflows.  For example, "xio -t
     -subflows 01" will set up a transmitter that sends two subflows
     numbered 0 and 1, while "xio -r -subflows 0" will set up a receiver
     that only subscribes to Subflow 0.

     Our demonstration of multi-level flow support consists of
     Workstation A multicasting a two-subflow digital video stream from
     a continuous audio+video source (such as a television channel) in
     which Subflow 0 contains audio and low-quality compressed video
     (JPEG quantization factor of 500), and Subflow 1 contains high-
     quality compressed video (JPEG quantization factor of 100) only.
     Workstation B receives both streams, playing the audio but
     discarding the video from Subflow 0 while showing the video from
     Subflow 1.  Workstation C receives only Subflow 0, from which it
     plays both the audio and video data.

CONCERT

     In December, the HPCC research group began evaluating the resource
     requirements for incorporating the Compressed Video
     Interoperability Protocol concept from Viewpoint Systems Inc. into
     a general interoperability framework for packet-based video
     conferencing.  This intention was conveyed through the following
     statement:

     "MCNC, in Research Triangle Park, N.C., intends to incorporate the
     Compressed Video Interoperability Protocol concept into a general
     framework being developed that will foster interoperability among



Cooper                                                         [Page 19]

     different video coding schemes. Supporting interoperability is
     consistent with the objectives of MCNC's existing Packet Video
     Project and associated Packet Video Forum. A detailed estimate of
     the scope of the effort and the required implementation resource is
     underway."

     In January, the ATM testing group and the HPCC research group
     successfully tested interoperation between 2 Fujitsu SMX-6000
     broadband service multiplexors and the Fore ASX-100 switch, at OC3c
     link speed.  A lesson learned was that applications should not use
     VCIs 14,15, and 65535 to avoid conflict with with internal use by
     the switch (software version 2.2.5).

CSUNET
------

     CSU was awarded a CALREN grant from Pacific Bell.  The grant will
     provide Pacific Bell ATM services at no charge for a two year
     trial.  The trial will be a joint venture between the California
     State University and University of California systems.  San Jose
     State University is the only university in the state of California
     now offering a Masters in Library Science.  The trial will exploit
     ATM services for transfer of video images and JPEG (2Mb-8Mb) video
     between three CSU campuses.  Instructional facilitators and
     cirriculum designers from CSU and UC will be collaborate to form a
     new M.S. in Library Science to be taught anywhere in California.

     On the new connections front, CSUnet continues to attract new
     education, research, and state agencies for connection to the
     Internet.  The focus remains on districts, libraries, county
     offices of education and community colleges rather than individual
     high schools because it is often the case that administrative
     systems connecting the high schools can be re-used for instruction.
     Latest members include:

     The County of Riverside (the entire county system will provide
       connections to county and city agencies)
     East Side Unified School District (San Jose area)
     Ventura County Superintendent of Schools
     Butte College (Chico area)
     City College of San Francisco
     Yosemite Community College District
     CSU Stanislaus Off-site Center
     San Joaquin Valley Library system
     Sonoma County Library system
     California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office

     CSUnet has installed a frame-relay hub in Los Alamitos and has
     contracted GTE to provision yet untariffed services.  Pacific Bell
     also is providing new frame-relay connections.  The "public" net is
     being used instead of our private net for these new 56K connections
     because of the low pricing by the RBOCs.

     TRAINING RESIDENTS OF THE GLOBAL VILLAGE
     The InterNIC Seminar Series
     ----------------------------------------

     The InterNIC Seminar Series "Training Residents of the Global
     Village" was unveiled January 20-21, 1994, at the Houghton-Mifflin
     Company in Boston, Massachusetts.  Employees of the company
     participated in two InterNIC seminars, "Using Network Tools
     Effectively" and "Building an Electronic Network Information
     Center", taught by Chris Weider of Bunyip Information Systems, Inc.
     Both programs were well received by the participants.

     Below is the Seminar Schedule for Feburary 1994.

     1.   Using Network Tools Effectively

     This seminar will demonstrate to new and experienced users how to
     effectively utilize current network tools to identify and locate
     valuable network resources.  Topics will include FTP, telnet, WAIS,
     WorldWideWeb, gopher, archie, X.500 and Whois++.

     x500 - Provides access to an X.500 client that gives access to a
     global X.500 directory tree.  The tree includes organizations that
     are participating in the Paradise project (worldwide, but primarily
     in Europe) and the White Pages Project in the US.

     All of these logins are available through telnet on our host,
     ds.internic.net.  No password is required for any of the logins.

     A reminder - if you would like to help the Internet community find
     a resource that you offer, send mail to admin@ds.internic.net and
     we will send information about listing your resource in the
     Directory of Directories.

     REGISTRATION SERVICES

     Significant Events
     ------------------

     InterNIC Registration Services received 2,320 calls in January,
     mainly as a result of an article in _USA Today Weekend_ magazine
     January 23, 1994.  The majority of these calls requested
     information on connecting to the Internet.

     A number of service providers have begun to implement inverse
     addressing on their existing CIDR blocks. Registration Services is
     working with each of these providers in transistioning inverse
     addressing so no customers are inconvenienced.

     NEWS FROM RARE (Reseaux Associes pour la Recherche Europeenne)

     CEENet

     A new international networking association has recently been
     established: CEENet, of which the members are at the moment: ACONET
     (Austria), UNICOM (Bulgaria), CARNet (Croatia), CESNET (Czech
     republic), NASK (Poland), SANET (Slovakia) and UARNet (Ukraine).
     More CEEC members are expected to join shortly. The members are
     networking organizations that represent their country with
     authorization from their government. CEENet's role is to coordinate
     international aspects of academic and research networking in the
     CEEC region.

     CEENet was admitted as International Membership of RARE. CEENet has
     chosen RARE as the umbrella body for networking for research in
     Europe. A planning group has been set up to discuss how best to
     coordinate infrastructure planning and to function as a point of
     reference.

     RARE/EARN merger

     With the overall target of strengthening user representation in
     Europe the Executives of EARN and RARE are progressing a merger
     between the two Associations.

     RARE Signatory of ICT MoU

     RARE has signed the Memorandum of Understanding on Partnership in
     Information and Communication Technology (ICT), a EC initiative
     targeting enhancing user involvement in ICT.

     Elections Executive Committee

     Committee takes office on 1 May 1994.

     RARE Technical Programme

     RARE will establish a project involving maintenance of the
     reference implementation of World Wide Web and will seek funding
     for this project.  The activity will be coordinated with Mosaic.

     The RARE Technical Committee is planning a Europe wide effort to
     coordinate the INIX and D-GIX activities and will raise the funding
     for this coordination effort.

     RARE  Publications

     RARE has published its seventh in its series of Technical Reports:
     "RTR7 (RFC1502) has appeared: X.400 use of Extended Character
     Sets".  The report was written by Harald Alvestrand from UNINETT,
     Trondheim in Norway.  The author believes that this specification
     can easily accomodate the use of any character set in the ISO
     registry . Also the guidelines given for choosing character sets
     will help interworking.

     This is the second Technical Report to be published as RTR and
     Internet RFC at the same time.  Paper copies of RARE publications
     are available from the RARE Secretariat. Electronic versions can be
     obtained from the RARE document server.

     Conferences and seminars

     INET'94/JENC5 Conference The annual Joint European Networking
     Conference (JENC) will be held in conjunction with the INET'94
     conference in Prague this year. This event will take place on 13-17
     June in Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic.  The conference
     committee of INET'94/JENC5 is chaired by Geoff Manning (UKERNA,
     responsible for JNT programme), while Bernhard Plattner (ETH,
     Zurich) again chairs the programme committee. Local arrangements
     are in the hands of Jan Gruntorad (Czech Technical University).

     At the moment the organizers are in the process of composing the
     programme for the conference which will become available in March.

     EARN is organizing a Network Services Conference in London, from 28
     to 30 November, subsequent to which a large RARE Working Group
     meeting will take place.

     The final report on the NATO Advanced Networking Workshop on
     Research Networking in Central and Eastern Europe that took place
     in Budapest last Autumn will be available from the fileserver,
     soon. The Workshop was very well attended and regarded as very
     useful by several countries.

     HIGH SPEED NETWORKING SYMPOSIUM

     The 3rd Symposium on High Speed Networking for Research in Europe
     was held on 2 February 1994.  The regis tration process for this
     symposium already showed a large interest with 148 participants
     from 24 countries, 2 even from Japan, but even more experts
     attended during the day.  The attendees' comments were full of
     praise of this unique opportunity to exchange and review High Speed
     Networking issues.

     Presentations

     There were 14 high-level presentations on various subjects such as:
     - engineering trans-oceanic 44 MBs TCP/IP networks
     - high speed services plans applied to backbone technology
     - coordinated ATM testing and services within Europe
     - multimedia experiments in SGN, the Stockholm Gigabit Network
     - LARA, an Interconnection of ATM products
     - ATM experiments for High Rate Space Telemetry Transportation
       and more.

     General

     The symposium was especially of interest to experts in the field of
     ATM. It brought together the practical experience of ATM from the
     research, PNO and service communities, as well as the experience
     from major commercial user organizations.

     Examples of on site, intersite and even international testing with
     ATM were covered, as well as research work related to supporting
     ATM at higher speed. Some of the current gaps in ATM
     implementations were identified, but it was noted that technical
     specifications in these areas had been, or were being, produced.

     An overview of some of the presentations

     Dr Leslie Clyne reported on the work of the RARE ATM Task Force
     which is coordinating ATM developments between RARE organizations,



Cooper                                                         [Page 38]

     and is acting as a forum for exchange of information and
     experience.  Coordination of input to the proposed European ATM PNO
     pilot is also being carried out.

     Dr Guy Almes described some of the network engineering issues
     associated with the deployment of a Trans-oceanic DS3 link between
     mainland USA and Hawaii.

     Dr Juha Heinanen presented the FUNET project which links ATM sites
     in Finland and is providing pilot services. He identified both the
     potential of ATM, and some of the technical shortcomings in areas
     such as agreement on protocol stacks, implementation of traffic
     policing and dynamic signalling.

     Dr Leslie Clyne reported on the national UK SuperJANET project
     which is using a combination of networking services and
     technologies including SMDS, and ATM over PDH/SDH, to provide high
     speed networking to over 50 sites. During the 1st half of 1994 some
     50 sites are getting SMDS connections at 10 Mbps, and at least 12
     sites will have ATM switches connected to the 100+ Mbps WAN
     bandwith.

     Prof. Bjorn Pehrson described the Stockholm SDH Gigabit testbed
     which is facilitating research into new multimedia experiments
     requiring 100's of Mbps of intersystem bandwith.

     Dr Jaques Prevost presented previous work on ATM in the French
     research community and the recently approved plan for national ATM
     testing and deployment.

     Mr Jalal Samain descri bed the BETEL project which in 1993
     transferred ATM cells between France and Switzerland. LAN's were
     connected using an ATM switch and Virtual Paths between routers.

     Mr Kees Neggers described the plan for SURFNet 4, which is an ATM-
     based technology pilot to connect 2, then 9 sites in the
     Netherlands.

     Ms Jocelyne Lemagnen described the extensive work done by the LARA
     consortium in France on LAN and WAN ATM testing. In particular the
     LAN environment used ATM switches from many vendors, and a variety
     of hosts were connected. Some of the technical gaps in
     specifications were identified.

     A presentation by Alcatel explained the current research trends on
     development of optical ATM switches which would allow use of the
     technology above the current limitation of Gigabit speed for access
     ports.

     Mr Rumeau described the use of ATM for the support of high speed
     (50 Mbit/sec) Constant Bit Rate services to interconnect ground
     sites and transfer bulk data from satellite experiments.

     Fourth Symposium on High Speed Networking

     The announcement of a fourth symposium on High Speed Networking for
     research in Europe in 2 or 3 years' time was warmly welcomed by
     all.  The proceedings will be published in the next issue of CNRE.
