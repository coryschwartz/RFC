INTERNET ARCHITECTURE MESSAGE

     IAB POSITIONS

     The Internet Activities Board (IAB) has selected Christian Huitema
     as its chair for the coming year.

     Other IAB positions are as follows:

       * Chair of Internet Research Task Force (IRTF): Jon Postel
       * RFC Editor: Jon Postel
       * Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA): Jon Postel
       * Executive Director: Bob Braden
       * Liaisons to IESG: Christian Huitema, Yakov Rekhter
       * Representative to CCIRN: Barry Leiner

     LIAISON WITH ISO AND ITU

     At its Tuesday evening open IAB meeting at Columbus in March, there
     was a discussion of possible liaisons between the IETF standards
     making activities and ISO, and between IETF and ITU.

     According to its charter, the IAB is responsible for liaison
     arrangements between the Internet standards process and other
     standards agencies.  The IAB has agreed that detailed negotiations
     with ISO and CCITT may be conducted by the ISOC President Vint
     Cerf, in consultation with the IAB.  If agreement is reached,
     liaison would be effected by a formal agreement between that
     standards body and the Internet Society, the legal entity that
     would represent the IAB/IESG/IETF for this purpose.

     The IAB, selected by the IETF membership under the new process,
     intends to be fully responsive to the needs and desires of the IETF
     and the Internet community.  The IAB wishes to strongly affirm
     that:

     (1) No agreement should or will be made with another standards
         body that will in any way impede progress or change the style
         of operation of the IETF.

     (2) The primary purpose of any such relationship, if it were to be
         established, would be to benefit the Internet through official
         recognition of the reality that the IETF is an important
         source of international computer communication standards.

     (3) The outcome of the IPng discussions should in no way be
         tied to the progress of such relationship.

Internet Monthly Report                                       April 1993


     Detailed negotiations on these matters are being conducted by the
     ISOC President Vint Cerf, on behalf of the IAB/IESG/IETF.  Two
     different liaison relationships with ISO are possible for the ISOC,
     Category A and Category C.  Category A would simply recognize that
     the ISOC/IAB/IETF is "another source of international standards",
     while Category C would allow liaison at the working group level.

     With the advice and consent of the IAB, the ISOC Board of Trustees
     previously initiated a request for category A liaison with ISO, and
     this request is pending.  In an unrelated action, Jack Holdsworth
     brought an offer from ISO/IEC JTC1/SC6 for Category C liaison.

     Since the Columbus meeting, it has been erroneously reported in
     parts of the trade press that the IAB agreed to pursue Category C
     liaison with ISO.  This is not correct.  The IAB has decided to
     delay action on the ISO category C liaison offer until negotiations
     on Category A are concluded.  Furthermore, there were many issues
     and concerns raised by IAB and IETF members attending the Columbus
     meeting.  Before Category C liaison could proceed, these issues
     must be settled to the satisfaction of the Internet community, and
     there must be general agreement that such liaison is in the best
     interests of the IETF.

     The IAB is preparing a more complete statement about these issues.

INTERNET PROJECTS
-----------------

ANSNET/NSFNET BACKBONE ENGINEERING
----------------------------------

     Network Status Summary
     ======================

     The deployment of the AIX 3.2 operating system on the T3 routers began
     on April 30th.  The deployment will continue through May 21st.  This
     software will increase the on-card forwarding table capacity to
     support 12,000 destinations, and the subsequent release of AIX 3.2
     software scheduled for summer '93 will increase the forwarding table
     capacity to support 25,000 destinations.

     Backbone Traffic and Routing Statistics
     =======================================

     The total inbound packet count for the network (measured using SNMP
     interface counters) was 36,527,140,345 on T3 ENSS interfaces, up 15.2%
     from March.  The total packet count into the network including all
     ENSS serial interfaces was 40,788,225,452.

     As of April 30, the number of networks configured in the Merit Policy
     Routing Database was 11248 for the T3 backbone.  Of these, 2846 were
     never announced to the T3 backbone (e.g. silent nets).  The maximum
     number of networks announced to the T3 backbone during the month (from
     samples collected every 15 minutes) was 8239, up 6.1% from February.
     Average announced networks on 4/30 were 8181.

     AIX 3.2 Migration Plan Status
     =============================

     The T3 backbone software upgrade to support the AIX 3.2
     operating system began on April 30th.  A revised postscript file
     illustrating the phased deployment at each POP CNSS and adjacent
     ENSS is located on ftp.ans.net in /pub/info/aix32dpmap.ps and may
     be summarized as follows:

     Phase I    (April 30) - Washington D.C.
     Phase II   (May 7)    - Seattle/Denver, San Francisco/Los Angeles
     Phase III  (May 14)   - Greensboro/Atlanta, Houston/St. Louis
     Phase IV   (May 21)   - Hartford/New York City, Cleveland/Chicago

     Rcp_routed Routing Software Changes
     ===================================

     During April two versions of the T3 router software daemon,
     rcp_routed, were deployed.  The first entitled "Third Party Routes"
     primarily addressed problems handling third party routes advertised
     by peer routers.  Deployment of this began in March and ended in
     early April.  A second version called "AIX 3.2 Multipath" addressed
     multipath routing in AIX 3.2, generated third party routes, and
     fixed some memory leaks.  Release notes are available in:

         ftp.ans.net:/pub/info/t3-rcp_routed/Release-Notes

     FDDI Problem
     ============

     During April, there were a few problems experienced at ENSS sites
     that use FDDI interfaces.  There was a problem identified on E145
     (also observed on E133) where packets are blocked from traversing
     an ENSS FDDI->Ethernet path.  The problem has occurred three times
     during April.  We are working on a fix for this, and the an
     automatic FDDI interface reset has been instrumented in the
     interim.

     Routing Stability Measured on the T3 Network
     ============================================

     Internal routing stability measurements are made by monitoring
     short term disconnect times (disconnects of five minutes duration
     or less).  During February the overall stability approached 99% (no
     internal disconnects in any part of the network 99% of the time)
     and all individual nodes reported 99.8% stability or better.
     Overall stability in March was down to 97.5% or 99.1% excluding
     instability during the configuration windows.  Overall stability in
     April was 96.1% or 97.2% excluding instability during the
     configuration windows.

     E206 (CERN - Geneva, Switzerland) remained the most unstable node
     due to recurring T1 circuit problems.  CERN was only stable 97.9%
     of the time which accounted for much of the overall 96.1% figure.
     Of the 15 hours, 10 hours was outside the config window (9:58 98.6%
     stable).  Much of the remaining time was during the config window
     when the circuit was taken for testing.

     E130 (Argonne) and E128 (BARRnet) each experienced instability due
     to a memory paging problem (described below).  E130 experienced
     5.25 hours of instability (5:28 99.2% stable) of which 4 hours was
     outside of the config window (4:02 99.5% stable).  E128 experienced

Internet Monthly Report                                       April 1993


     3.5 hours of instability (3:35 99.5% stable) with 2.5 hours outside
     the config window (2:38 99.7% stable).

     A new installation, E229, saw 2.5 hours of instability, mostly
     early in April just prior to the production activation of the node.
     A few nodes suffered adapter hardware or microcode problems.  These
     were E133 (Cornell) with 1:35 (99.78% stable), E145, (Fix-E) with
     1:04 (99.85% stable), E136 (College Park) with 1:03 (99.85%
     stable), and E168 (OARnet) with 0:56 (99.87% stable).  E133 only
     experienced 0.5 minutes of instability outside the config window,
     since the outage fell within the window.  E145 had 0:18, E136 had
     0:20, E168 had 0:25 minutes of instability outside the config
     windows.  These are all better than 99.9%.  The outages time
     incurred when replacing a failing interface is generally much
     longer than the outage that the failing interface causes,
     consequently the bulk of the instability is during the config
     window.

     Of the remaining routers, 24 reported between 15-60 minutes of
     outage time.  The remaining 57 reported under 15 minutes of
     instability (better than 99.97%).  If the config windows are
     excluded, only 4 routers, E206, E130, E128, and E229 reported over
     26 minutes of outage.  There were 9 routers that reported 10-26
     minutes of instability.

     Paging Problem at E130 (Argonne) and E128 (Barrnet)
     ===================================================

     On April 6th-9th, E130 experienced intermittent routing
     instability.  Most of this outage occurred during weekend hours. On
     April 17-20 E128 (BARRnet) experienced similar problems.  There
     were a number of problems occurring which in combination caused AIX
     software memory paging problems.

     One problem on E128 had to do with the FDDI ring going down.  A
     larger than normal number of internal buffers (mbufs) used by the
     networking code were consumed while this condition existed.  This
     reduces the amount of memory available for normal processes such as
     the routing daemon and network management programs, etc.  This was
     addressed by reducing the requirement for mbufs for TCP buffering
     for BGP sessions, and by correcting problems with the FDDI ring.
     This improved but did not solve the problem.

     The next problem involved flapping FDDI peers which caused a great
     deal of logging that resulted in a very large system messages file
     created on April 17.  The reading of the system messages file by
     another process induced routing daemon memory paging problems on
     the node.  The solution to the problem involved both reducing the

     routing daemon memory size (since the problem was associated with
     paging), and the splitting of the large log file.  A new version of
     the routing software will be deployed in mid May.

     Notable Outages in April '93
     ============================

     E132 (Pittsburgh) lost T3 connectivity due to power problems on
     4/11.

     E168 (OARnet) suffered an extended outage to hardware failure on
     4/23.

     E173 (ITESM) suffered extended outages due to power problems on
     4/5, 4/11, and due to radio fade on 4/16.

     E206 (CERN) suffered extended circuit outages on 4/13, 4/16, 4/23.

     Xlink (Germany) suffered an extended circuit outage on 4/6.

     C11 (San Francisco) became unreachable on 4/3 causing an outage to
     E159, E178, E187, E229.

     C17 (Los Angeles) suffered an HSSI card hang on 4/10 causing an
     outage to E156, E170, E215, E216.

     Defense Simulation Internet (DSI)

     The DSI supported three demonstrations this month as well as
     ongoing testing for a major demonstration in May.  These were all
     successful.

     The ST2 software release is in beta test.  Some bugs still exist,
     but these are being fixed as the beta test period continues.  More
     sites will be added to the beta test over the next couple of weeks.

     Several WPSen were relocated to different sites to help reduce
     backbone circuit costs.  In addition, a second WPS was added to the
     D.C. area and another was installed in Norfolk, VA to support the
     large number of sites in this area.

     A new release of Wideband Packet Switch (WPS) code to support ST2
     was deployed on all 11 WPSen.

     Increased usage on the network is exceeding the capacity of the T1
     backbone.  The planning process for increasing the backbone
     capacity has begun.

     Scaleability

     Work is progressing on adding statistics collection to the flow-
     level network simulator, and we are working on an analysis
     environment for analyzing simulation results.

     (See December '92 Internet Monthly Report for more details about
     this project and the toolset being developed.)

     Real-time Multicast Communications and Applications

     We are currently implementing the shared streams service, using the
     Fair Share resource reservation code as a basis for resource
     enforcement.  An initial version of Resource Coordination Objects
     (RCOs) is being designed and implemented to support user-level
     reservation for shared streams.

     We are also looking at additional applications for the four real-
     time multicast services in this project (anycasting, multi-level
     flows, shared streams, RCOs).  One possibility is the use of RCOs
     for network-wide resource reservation, a need that has become
     apparent in some DARTnet experiments.

     During the month of March, we also worked on improvements to the
     video server in two areas.  First, we substantially improved the
     interface between the workstations that control the Parallax codecs
     used to convert analog video to digital video, transmit the digital
     video across a wide area network, and receive and display the video
     in a window on a workstation.  This work provides the basis for two
     new capabilities.

     First, the video server can make use of multicast communications to
     support multiple people viewing the same video simultaneously.  In
     earlier versions of the video server, if multiple people requested
     the same video, a separate unicast data connection was initiated
     for each user.  In the new version of the video server, if a user
     requests the same video (for example, a broadcast channel) as is
     being transmitted to another user, then the initial unicast data
     connection is broken and a multicast data connection is established
     to the two or more users who have requested the same video.

     Second, multicast digital video streams can now be broken into
     multi-level (i.e. multi-bandwidth) encodings.  The multi-level data
     stream capability will allow multiple users to receive the same
     video stream over different bandwidth connections; one user may
     receive a high quality, high bandwidth video stream over high
     bandwidth network connections, while another user can
     simultaneously view the same video at a lower quality over lower

Internet Monthly Report                                       April 1993


     bandwidth network connections.  One network mechanism that can be
     used to support this work is the multi-level flows communications
     service that we are developing as part of this project.

     In the past month, we have also made improvements to the video
     catalog service, a distributed service which catalogs text
     information used to index video.  In earlier versions of the video
     server, the host name of all video catalogs was stored at a well
     known host, referred to as the catalog of catalogs.  The video
     applications used unicast communications to contact the catalog of
     catalogs and obtain the names of hosts that contained video
     catalogs.  In the new catalog service, workstations that contain
     video catalogs join the video catalog multicast group; thus, the
     information as to where video catalogs are located resides with the
     servers and not with the applications.  Applications send queries
     to locate video information directly to a video catalog multicast
     address and the applications receive responses from all servers
     that contain video information relevant to the request.

     The use of multicast for this service provides an important
     capability for wide area video information servers.  The multicast
     capability allows video server sites to change the machines hosting
     catalog services, and it allows sites to add and remove video
     servers (and their associated catalogs) without having to modify
     video applications and without having to update a centralized
     database of video service locations.

     (See January '93 and March '93 Internet Monthly Reports for more
     details about the application and communications services being
     developed.)

     Inter-Domain Policy Routing

     During the month of April, we completed the IDPR pilot
     installation.  Many thanks to Brad Passwaters, Shehzad Merchant,
     Walt Prue, Tony Ballardie, and Jeff Burgan for assistance in
     providing and booting machines and installing software.

     The IDPR pilot demonstration will run through May 1993.  We will
     provide an informational RFC on the pilot and the perceived
     results, at the conclusion of this time period.

Internet Monthly Report                                       April 1993


     We have also been proceeding with the design of multicasting in a
     policy-based environment.  In particular, we have been making
     modifications to both the route generation procedure and the path
     control protocol portions of IDPR, in order to accommodate
     multicast.  We plan to experiment in the DARTnet this summer with
     prototype software and to release an Internet Draft describing the
     modifications necessary to do multicasting in the context of IDPR.

CONCERT
-------

     The number of accounts connected to the CONCERT network grew by 21
     percent during the first quarter of 1993.

     CONCERT is currently testing the LARSE Mega-T inverse multiplexer
     to deliver a 4Mbs V.35 link using three T1s between the UNC-
     Charlotte campus and the CONCERT hub at Research Triangle Park.

     For the past several weeks CNIDR (Clearinghouse for Networked
     Information Discovery and Retrieval) has provided an alternate
     server site for the popular Veronica resource discovery software
     developed at the University of Nevada-Reno by Steve Foster and Fred
     Barrie.  Veronica (very easy rodent-oriented net-wide index to
     computerized archives) is an "archie for gopher." The CNIDR server
     receives approximately 5000 queries daily from people searching
     gopherspace menus.

     On April 9, 1993, CNIDR released freeWAIS 0.1, the first upgrade to
     WAIS in over 6 months. freeWAIS incorporates many of the
     enhancements such as Boolean searching, phrase searching, stemming,
     access control, and better document relevance scoring, and a
     redundant directory-of-servers.  freeWAIS-0.1 is designed to be a
     "backwards compatibility" module for freeWAIS-1.0, which will
     provide full Z39.50-92 support and is nearing completion. freeWAIS
     0.1 is available via anonymous ftp from ftp.cnidr.org.  For general
     information and timely announcements about CNIDR, send e-mail to

     During the month of April, VISTAnet (one of the five testbeds
     sponsored by CNRI) achieved partial connectivity over an
     experimental Broadband ISDN network operating at 622Mbps.

     The VISTAnet network operates between the CRAY-YMP at the North
     Carolina Supercomputing Center, the Pixel Planes-5 graphics
     processing engine at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,
     and a medical workstation at UNC Memorial Hospital Radiation

     Oncology department.  Networking services are provided by Bell
     South and GTE. The driving application for VISTAnet is real-time
     radiation therapy planning.

     The VISTAnet network connects the three computational resources
     using HiPPI to a Network Terminal Adapter (NTA). The NTA acts as a
     HiPPI-to-ATM/SONET modem at SONET rates of OC-12c (622Mbps). Two
     switching nodes will provide switched services, a Fast Circuit
     Switch provided by GTE and an ATM switch provided by Bell South.

     Only partial connectivity was achieved since the GTE circuit switch
     must still be added to the network. Using HiPPI test equipment and
     the endpoint hosts, data was transmitted and received data at rates
     of up to 400Mbps with an acceptable quality of service. For
     VISTAnet the target quality of service is less than 4 lost/errored
     HiPPI packets in 1 hour of operation.

     Also experimented with were the ability and limitations of a BISDN
     network to handle very high speed burst data traffic in tandem with
     low speed traffic. These experiments gave some insights into the
     limitations of statistical multiplexing of ATM networks. We also
     developed some guidelines for traffic shaping for both high speed
     and low speed traffic.

     MULTIMEDIA CONFERENCING

     This month, the Real-time Tranport Protocol (RTP) was integrated
     into PVP, ISI's packet video program.  Now implemented in several
     real-time packet audio and video programs, RTP has allowed
     interoperation among different implementations of these tools.  A
     parameter -N was added to PVP to allow a name to be transmitted in
     the RTP protocol so nv will display it when PVP and nv
     interoperate.  In addition, enhancements were made to PVP to make
     it more readily configurable to work with a Bolter codec or a
     PictureTel codec.

     Steve Casner gave a talk "Internet Video -- Meltdown or the Next
     Email?" at the National Net '93 conference in Washington, D.C.

MERIT/NSFNET ENGINEERING
------------------------

     During April, the set of major activities included use of the Informix
     database system for all NSFNET configuration services; changes to the
     international IP network registration process; progress on automating
     the submission of database update requests from midlevels; further
     analysis of active and inactive network routing announcements;
     progress in implementation of IDRP; and progress in testing and
     implementation of TUBA.

     Informix Database System in Production
     ======================================

     Full production for the new Policy Routing Database (PRDB) and NSFNET
     Configuration System began with the configuration run on April 2. The
     system is used for registration of network routing announcements as
     well as topology configuration for the ANSNET.  A set of tools for
     parsing and automatically entering database updates from e-mail
     templates is now in production.

     Automated Submission of Network Announcement Change Requests
     ============================================================

     Requests for network numbers to be added to the NSFNET PRDB have
     traditionally been handled by submitting templates via e-mail to the
     Merit staff. Recently we have significantly improved the productivity
     of configuration operators by automating much of the handling of the
     requests and subsequent database entry process.

     Our current focus is on the submission process. We are working on a
     tool which will allow a midlevel network engineer to interactively
     generate a template. Initially it will available as a 'login' style
     service on a host at Merit, as a server that allows the information
     fields for network information to be filled in.

     The interactive program will perform some of the validation and
     advance lookups of information to avoid manual cross-checking by
     operators. For example, the InterNIC has provided a machine- parsable
     output format for whois queries, which can be used to allow the
     organizational or point-of-contact information to be directly copied
     from whois into the Merit database. The program will also query
     Merit's PRDB server to present the current routing configuration
     relevant to the reqest being built.

     We expect the first release of the interactive process to be available
     in early May.

     Changes to International IP Network Registration
     ================================================

     Merit's "IPREGISTER" service is provided to network operators and
     administrators in countries which are becoming connected or need
     assistance in connecting to the Internet and NSFNET. The goal is to
     assist in achieving connectivity to the NSFNET as quickly and
     efficiently as possible within contraints of agency policies.

     The service was orginally established when IP numbers were allocated
     with a "connected" or "unconnected" flag. At that time, NSF had to
     sponsor an organization in order for them to receive an IP number with
     the "connected" flag. It was important for non-domestic networks to
     receive this classification if they desired to communicate with
     scientists and researchers via the NSFNET backbone.  "Connected"
     status was a requirement for routing traffic on the NSFNET backbone.

     Since NSF was unable to know the appropriateness of sponsoring each
     and every non-domestic network, and there was not a consolidated
     European, Asian, South American, and other regional networking
     organization to consult, NSF established reciprocal agreements with
     designated representatives within countries.  This action translated
     into a procedure which was implemented by Merit.  One of the steps of
     the procedure was to delay addition of non-domestic networks into the
     NSFNET routing database until the designated representatives from that
     country acknowledged and confirmed this addition.

     While this procedure served us well during the days when "connected"
     status existed and when the IEPG (Intercontinental Engineering
     Planning Group), the RIPE NCC, and the EBONE were non-existant, the
     procedure was out-dated and delayed the desired connectivity.

     Merit has revised its procedure so that we eliminate the requests for
     concurrence to designated representatives of foreign countries when
     configuring the NSFNET routing tables.  We no longer need to delay
     routing of non-domestic networks into the NSFNET routing database
     while waiting for responses to such requests.

     At the same time, it is no longer necessary for NSF to preapprove
     access on a network by network basis. Except for a list of specific
     countries, all non-US routing requests are handled without any
     approval delay.  A bi-weekly report is now produced listing all of the
     non-US networks added during the configuration run. This works nicely
     with the automated processing of routing announcement change templates
     that has been added recently.

     One important task of IPREGISTER has not changed, and that is in
     helping non-domestic networks obtain various network services.  Among

Internet Monthly Report                                       April 1993


     these are submitting requests to the InterNIC or RIPE for IP numbers,
     and making sure the whois entry is updated and that it corresponds to
     what is in the Merit Policy Routing Database as well as the RIPE
     entry, if appropriate.

     Further Analysis of Active/Inactive Routing Announcements
     =========================================================

     Known as "silent nets", a substantial population of networks in the
     configuration database are not announced to the backbone. While we are
     confident that the backbone router tables will not overflow due to
     growth in announced networks, it is our goal to limit the set of
     networks in the backbone configuration files to those which are
     actually expected to be announced by midlevels to the backbone.

     A similar goal has been to analyze the routing tables over time and
     determine whether the configuration of Autonomous System path
     preference for each network matches the actual announced preference.
     In response to our messages to AS administrators, we have received
     requests to delete over 400 silent nets. We have also been able to
     reconfigure the announcement preferences for many networks to bring
     the number of primary network announcements matching the configured
     path to 99%.

     The "OFFNET" database process collects routing table dumps every 15
     minutes from the backbone for analysis. A summary of reports and
     information generated from this database follows. Graphs showing
     growth of configured networks as compared to actual announcements, and
     the AS path preference comparison, can be found via anonymous FTP from
     the directory merit.edu:pub/nsfnet/offnet.

     protocols, including TUBA (TCP and UDP over CLNP) and IDRP.  The
     IDRP implementation is progressing well, and a demonstration was
     given to the FAA and Mitre staff on April 20. Merit will
     participate in the European JENC conference demo of TUBA in May.
     Mark Cochran of IBM visited Merit to assist in AIX 3.2 kernel
     development for TUBA, IDRP and CLNP.

MERIT/NSFNET/INFORMATION SERVICES
---------------------------------

     During the month of April, Romania and Bulgaria were the most
     recent nations to begin routing traffic over the NSFNET Backbone
     Service, as a result of their reclassification to favored nation
     status by COCOM.

     The text of the report "Review of NSFNET" by the Office of
     Inspector General of the National Science Foundation, followed by
     the text of NSF's response to the OIG report, is available for
     Anonymous FTP from the host nic.merit.edu as /nsfnet/ig.report  .

NEARNET (NEW ENGLAND ACADEMIC AND RESEARCH NETWORK)
---------------------------------------------------

     During the week of April 12, NEARnet held a semi-annual security
     test.  The test involved calling the designated security contacts
     at all NEARnet sites to confirm our readiness in the event of a
     Network Security Emergency.  The test went very well with
     approximately 87% of the sites contacting NEARnet personnel in
     response to the test.

     As part of the FARNET "Service Excellence" program, two groups of
     NEARnet liaisons participated in a focus group which analyzed their
     perspectives of NEARnet/Internet services and concentrated on
     suggested areas for improvement.

     The NEARnet User Services staff has distributed a copy "The Whole
     Internet User's Guide and Catalog" by Ed Krol, free of charge, to
     the information liaison at every NEARnet member organization as

OARNET
------

     IETF Meeting in Late March

     The 26th Internet Engineering Task Force meeting was held at
     Columbus, OH, hosted by OARnet and The Ohio State University. The
     conference was very well attended, and went off excellently. The
     terminal room was stocked with 25 PCs, running software donated by
     FTP Software, Inc. In addition, there were terminal server ports,
     ethernet and appletalk connectors for people bringing in their own
     laptops. As an experiment, dialup IP access was provided for all
     who requested so. A total of 45 hours of async PPP access, and 11
     hours of async SLIP access were logged by the attendees.

Internet Monthly Report                                       April 1993


     In keeping with the IETF tradition, all the plenaries, and at least
     two of each session was simulcast to the Internet using packet
     audio and video. Cameras and a VCR for this purpose were donated by
     the Ohio Visualisation Laboratory.

     To provide reliable access, LCI International, and Ohio Bell
     telephone company donated a total of 3 T1 circuits for the IETF.
     One of the T1s was used to carry multicast traffic for the
     simulcast exclusively, and connected the terminal room directly to
     the OARnet POP at Cleveland, while another one carried unicast
     traffic from the terminal room to the nearest OARnet backbone POP;
     the third T1 was used to interconnect the OARnet POP at Cleveland
     to the ANS POP at North Royalton.  At peak periods, OARnet offered
     approximately 400Kb/sec of IETF audio and video traffic to the ANS
     backbone and about 100Kb/sec of IETF terminal room traffic, or
     about 500Kb/sec in total.

     At this IETF, most of the major "IPv7" contenders, PIP, TUBA, and
     SIP/IPAE also demonstrated current implementation status.

UCL
----

     1. The INRIA Video Conferencing System Software has been merged
     with our CODEC software so we can now generate video from a sparc
     or SGI and send over IP (multicast) and receive, encapsulate in
     H.221 (with CRCs!) and hand to a CODEC, and vice versa. Currently,
     this is working at 64kbps and 128 kbps - we will move to higher
     speeds as and when.

     2. We hosted one of the schools for the Global Schoolhouse
     Project's first video class over the Internet on April the 26th
     succesfully (after a number of successful demos where the first hop
     was running over our campus FDDI, on the day, this broke and we had
     to fallbacvk to a copper voicegrade line (driven at 256kbps!) from
     UCL to the UK international gateway with some clever last minute
     re-routing. Details reports no doubt will appear elsewhere. Many
     thanks to the Cornell people for introducing us to CUSeeMe (yet
     another neat conferencing program!). J Crowcroft now knows more
     about MACs than he cares to admit.

     3. We hosted the first SuperJANET demonstration day on te 28th - as
     reported before, this net is now being bought up, and many high
     speed applications were shown to the various sponsors.
