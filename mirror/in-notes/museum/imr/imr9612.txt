INTERNET MONTHLY REPORTS
------------------------

The purpose of these reports is to communicate to the Internet Research
Group the accomplishments, milestones reached, or problems discovered by
the participating organizations.

Each organization is expected to submit a 1/2 page report on the first
business day of the month describing the previous month's activities.
These reports should be submitted via network mail to "IMR@ISI.EDU".

`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

The Internet Monthly Report mailing list is now managed by MajorDomo at
ISI.EDU.  The announcements of new issues on the Internet Monthly Report
are sent to the IETF-Announce list and to this IMR list.

Requests to be ADDED or DELETED from the Internet Monthly report list
should be sent to "majordomo@isi.edu" with the message body either
"subscribe imr" or "unsubscribe imr".

Details on obtaining the current IMR, or back issues, via FTP or EMAIL
may be obtained by sending an EMAIL message to "rfc-info@ISI.EDU" with
the message body "help: ways_to_get_imrs".  For example:

                  IETF Monthly Report for December, 1996


     1. The IETF meeting, hosted by cicso Systems, met in San Jose,
        California on December 9-13, 1996. As has been noted, it was the
        largest IETF meeting to date with just under 2000 registered
        attendees. The IETF opens 1997 in Memphis, Tennessee where
        Federal Express will be the host. This meeting will be held
        April 7-11, 1997. Following Memphis, the IETF is we returning
        to Europe and will met in Munich, Germany August 11-15, 1997,
        hosted by Digi/ISOC.DE. The Secretariat is still working on the
        final meeting of 1997 (probably located in Washington, DC).

        Once all the arrangements have been made, notifications will be
        sent to the IETF Announcement list. Remember that information
        on future IETF meetings can be always be found in the file
        0mtg-sites.txt which is located on the IETF shadow directories.
        This information can also be viewed from the IETF Home Page on
        the Web. The URL is:

                            http://www.ietf.org


     2. The minutes of the IESG teleconferences have been publicly
        available on the IETF Shadow directories since 1991. These
        files are placed in the /ftp/iesg directory.

        The following IESG minutes have been added:

           November 21, 1996 (iesg.96-11-21)

     3. The IESG approved or recommended the following three Protocol
        Actions during the month of December, 1996:

     INTERNIC DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES

     The latest version of the Netfind seed database has over 950,000
     entries.  The database continues to expand at a rapid rate (the
     November version had just over 760,000 entries).  This version of
     the seed database is in the new format, and we will continue to
     provide updates in the new format, which requires Netfind source
     code version 5.0.2.  There is a copy of the old format of the
     October/November seed database available on our site, but we will
     no longer update the old format.

     Sites running Netfind servers should check

                http://ds.internic.net/wp/netfind-seeddb.html

     THE US DOMAIN REGISTRY

     The US Domain has an online line registration form (see
     "http://www.isi.edu/us-domain".

     The US Domain administrator no longer makes direct registrations of
     hosts, and only makes delegations of third or fourth level domain
     names (such as localities).

     Some of the processing of the requests for the third level domain
     names is now automated. In particular, most requests to register
     names in localities already delegated are automatically forwarded
     to the administrator for that locality.

     MAJOR SUBDOMAINS DELEGATED

     K12     CC      TEC     STATE   LIB     MUS     GEN     DST     COG
     ===================================================================

     ===================================================================

     The K12, CC, TEC, LIB, STATE, DST, COG and GEN domain under
     each state are established for special purposes (see RFC 1480).

     In addition to the constaint to use them only for the
     defined purpose, each of these special domains is also
     to delegated only to a manager  within the state, and the
     operation of the delegated registry should be non-profit.

     The LIB domain should be managed by a govermental or
     educational library organization.

     Further, it is most appropriate for the K12, CC, and TEC,
     domains to be managed by an educational organization (for
     example, a university or a department of education).

Internet Monthly Report                                   December 1996


     The STATE domain is most appropriately managed by an agency
     of the state government.  DST and COG should be managed by a
     goverment agency.

     The GEN domain may be delegated to any organization that
     will provide the registration service for free (and remember
     the purpose of the GEN domain is to register statewide
     non-profit organizations).

MERIT INTERNET ENGINEERING
--------------------------

     This report summarizes December 1996 activities of Merit's Internet
     Engineering group on behalf of the Routing Arbiter (RA) service and
     other projects.

     Merit is pleased to announce "Route Server Next Generation" (RSNG),
     a new service supported by exchange point operators nationwide.
     The project provides for continued operation of the Route Servers,
     which were developed by Merit and the University of California
     Information Sciences Institute as part of the NSF-funded Routing
     Arbiter project.  The Route Servers take over the task of
     processing routing updates for ISP routers, eliminating the need to
     establish separate peering sessions with other routers at each
     exchange point.  The Route Servers thus provide a boost in
     throughput for ISP routers and allow faster delivery of customers'
     data through the Internet. For more information about RSNG, see:

                         http://www.merit.edu/~rsng

     Route Server operations at the Network Access Points were supported
     by the National Science Foundation until January 1, 1997.  NSF made
     the decision to commercialize Route Server and Network Access Point
     operations following the 24-month review of the Routing Arbiter and
     the four NAP projects in July 1996.  NSF noted that all these
     projects had completed their basic missions ahead of schedule, and







Kennedy                                                        [Page 13]

Internet Monthly Report                                   December 1996


     stated that the Routing Arbiter and the NAPs "have now proven that
     multiple network providers can work together in a competitive
     marketplace, and so can be scheduled for transition to commercial
     operations themselves."  Routing Arbiter Database support and
     development continue to be supported by NSF, along with several
     routing engineering and statistical research projects.

     Last month's report described development work on Trawhoisd, a
     distributed version of the RADB whois server that supports data
     caching by FTP and by mirroring.  We neglected to note that the
     database mirroring mechanism was developed by David Kessens of the
     RIPE NCC.  We apologize for the omission.

     Merit staff members Sue Hares, Bill Norton, Craig Labovitz, Jerry
     Winters, and Jake Khuon attended the 37th IETF in San Jose during
     the week of December 9.  Norton gave a talk at the afternoon
     plenary session about Merit's Route Server Next Generation project.
     Winters discussed Trawhoisd at a Routing Policy System Working
     Group meeting, and Labovitz gave a presentation titled "Internet
     Routing Stability Analysis" at the IEPG meeting preceding IETF.

     IETF was also the site of a Merit GateD Consortium meeting.  The
     next release of GateD, expected in early 1996, will incorporate
     support for route dampening, the BGP Multi Exit Discriminator
     (MED), and the BGP Destination Preference Attribute (DPA). Future
     releases will provide support for multicast routing, incorporate
     several OSPF enhancements, and support the CMU-SNMP agent and SNMP
     ISODE Smux interfaces.  For more information about the GateD
     Consortium, see:

UCL
----

     Ballardie, Crowcroft, Kirstein and Perkins attended the San Jose
     IETF, and participated in rsvp, qos routeing and mmusic WGs.
     Crowcroft co-chaired the new WG on Large Scale Multicast, and
     Ballardie co-chaired the IDMR working group.

     Plans on CAIRN connectivity for UCL have now just about reached
     closure.
