     2. The next IETF meeting will be held in Stockholm, Sweden the week
        of July 17-21, 1995. Due to the meeting costs, the IETF
        attendance fee for the Stockholm meeting will be US$300. Hotel
        information has already been sent to the Announcement list, and
        attendees are encouraged to make their plane and hotel
        reservations.

        Following Stockholm, the IETF will be meeting in Dallas, Texas
        on December 4-8, 1995. Our local host for this meeting is MCI.
        Once all the arrangements have been made, notifications will be
        sent to the IETF Announcement list. Remember that information
        on future IETF meetings can be always be found in the file 0mtg-
        sites.txt which is located on the IETF shadow directories. This
        information can also be viewed from the IETF Home Page on the
        Web. The URL is:

     3. During the opening session of the IETF Meeting in Danvers, the
        IETF Chair asked for volunteers to host future IETF meetings.
        Anyone interested in hosting a meeting or obtaining information
        on what is expected of hosts should contact the IETF

     Network Status Summary
     ======================

     ANSnet total packet traffic decreased by about 34% in April '95.  A
     decrease in the ANSnet forwarding table size of 1.58% was observed
     during the month of April.  The NSFNET Backbone Service was
     terminated on April 30th, 1995.


     April Backbone Traffic Statistics
     =================================

     The total inbound packet count for the ANSnet (measured using SNMP
     interface counters) was 36,604,621,473 on T3 ENSS interfaces, down
     43.11% from March.  The total packet count into the network
     including all ENSS serial interfaces was 53,760,254,287 down 33.96%
     from March.

     NIMROD - NEXT GENERATION ROUTING AND ADDRESSING FOR THE INTERNET

     The goal of the Nimrod project is to design, specify, implement and
     test a flexible new routing and addressing architecture suitable
     for very large scale internets. The basic architecture for
     computation of routes will be based on distribution of network
     topology maps, with source-specified route selection, and local
     (i.e. not hop by hop) computation of routes.

     The architecture provides a single homogeneous framework for all
     routing, including both inter-domain and intra-domain.

     Highlights:

     - The Nimrod IETF-BOF is now a working group.

     - The following IDs have been released:

     REAL-TIME INFORMATION TRANSFER AND NETWORKING (RITN)

     RITN is the successor program of what used to be called
     "Scalability." Its goal is to provide networking support to very
     large scale distributed interactive simulations (DIS).  BBN is
     presently working cooperatively with NRL, NRaD, Lincoln Lab and
     Loral Advanced Distributed Simulation (LADS) to implement a
     prototype system for reducing the wide-area traffic load of DIS
     exercises by aggressive application of IP multicasting.  In order
     to meet the traffic reduction goals of this program, simulation
     application hosts must be provided with multicasting service that
     can accommodate 10's of thousands of concurrently subscribed groups
     with highly dynamic membership (100s of joins per second and less-
     than-.5-sec. join time).  On top of this, simulation traffic must
     be afforded quality-of-service guarantees.

     Unfortunately, currently available wide-area networking technology
     doesn't provide this degree of multicast service on a large scale.
     ARPA/ASTO has settled on an interim approach to this problem in
     order to meet impending operational requirements of the Synthetic
     Theater of War (STOW) program.  The interim approach involves a
     gateway that sits at each site between the site LAN and the WAN
     access point.  Among other traffic reduction functions like host
     throttling and selective packet dropping, this gateway provides a
     set of services called "bilevel multicast routing and QoS."  BBN is
     handling the design and implementation of the bilevel services.

     The essential idea is that a large number of highly dynamic
     multicast groups defined by the application hosts get "mapped into"
     a smaller number of relatively static multicast groups defined in
     the intersite WAN.  The gateway appears to the application hosts as
     a multicast-capable router, accepting IGMP messages from them and
     forwarding their multicast-addressed packets from site to site(s).
     To the WAN, the gateway appears as a host belonging to some

Internet Monthly Report                                       April 1995


     relatively stable number of multicast groups defined in the WAN.

     For QoS, the situation is similar.  The application hosts will be
     equipped with RSVP daemons.  The HPAG will include a QoS module
     that accepts RSVP messages from the hosts at a site.  It will then
     combine the host bandwidth requirements with the mapping of LAN-
     defined multicast groups to WAN groups to determine an aggregate
     bandwidth requirement for each WAN group.  This information will be
     provided to both the WAN (when and if it is RSVP-capable) and the
     HPAG load-leveling functions, so that they can police the locally
     generated traffic to protect it from arbitrary packet dropping in
     the WAN.

     The ultimate goal is to be able to remove the interposed gateway as
     soon as there are wide-area routers capable of providing the
     large-number-of-groups, highly dynamic multicast service required
     for large-scale DIS.  By implementing the interim solution
     described here, the hosts get an "early lesson" in how to use the
     services to maintain high-fidelity, large-scale simulations while
     sending information only to where it is needed.  Furthermore, ARPA
     gets an early empirical assessment of what kind of service is
     needed from IP multicast routing and RSVP, so they can better
     influence future enhancements of these services.

     At the end of April, BBN had completed detailed designs for the
     modules and interfaces of the bilevel routing and QoS schemes.
     Prototype implementations will be completed over the next few
     months and integrated with code being written by other RITN
     participants.  BBN has also written a traffic generator for testing
     the resulting system with traffic that authentically represents
     real DIS multicast traffic flows.  This generator is currently
     undergoing performance tuning.  A corresponding instrumented
     traffic sink will be designed and built in the next few weeks.

CHICAGO NAP
-----------

     General Status:

     The "Contingency Plan" FDDI configuration at the Chicago NAP is
     operational now. At the downtown Chicago site, AADS has purchased
     and installed routers for ANS, MCI and Sprint to support the NSFNET
     transition.  MCI and ANS are peering and exchanging production
     traffic across the local FDDI. The Routing Arbiter's route server
     is also attached to this FDDI. The Sprint circuit order is still in
     progress.  These FDDI-attached routers are also all attached to the

     single NAP-connected) providers are working on establishing transit
     agreements with national (ie.  multi-connected) providers.

     Recent Events:

     Argonne, Fermi and University of Chicago have upgraded from their
     DS3 SMDS trial to ATM NAP connections. Fermi and UOC will remain at
     DS3, while Argonne will upgrade to OC3c. In addition, University of
     Illinois at Chicago is connecting at OC3c.

     The AT&T switch has been upgraded with new port cards, for greater
     buffering capability and a new software revision.

     Next Steps:

     Many circuit installations are in progress and new orders are being
     taken. Peering agreements should allow many new ATM PVCs to be
     established.  Ongoing testing of router, DSU and switch performance
     is occuring at the AADS lab in Hoffman Estates, IL. Bellcore is
     testing the cisco DS3 AIP card. It is expected that the DS3 AIP
     will be the next upgrade step for NAP customers, as it supports
     rate shaping and eliminates the ADSU. The contingency plan routers
     and FDDI will remain in place for at least 6 months, or until the
     ATM performance is proved to be satisfactory.

     TEN-34 CONSORTIUM: TOWARDS A REAL SUPERHIGHWAY FOR EUROPEAN
     RESEARCH

     A Consortium of eighteen European research and university
     networking organisations[1], has submitted a proposal with the name
     TEN-34 in response to the joint call for proposals issued by DG III
     and DG XIII of the European Commission under the Fourth Framework
     Programme; a compatible proposal was also submitted under the ACTS
     programme. The Commission had invited organisations to collaborate
     in the preparation of bids to establish the interconnection of
     European research and university networks at 34-155 Mbps supported
     in part by EU funding. DANTE acts as the co-ordinating body in the
     Consortium, providing the main technical and financial management
     as well as assistance to the TEN-34 Steering Committee with the
     preparation of plans and proposals. A number of public network
     operators have agreed to be Associated Partners in the TEN-34
     proposal.

     The main technical goal of the TEN-34 Consortium is to establish
     and maintain a leading-edge backbone designed to interconnect the
     National Networks. This will create early opportunities for the
     research and university community to establish new pan-European
     networking applications based on new technology.

     The initial aim is the provision of a 34 Mbps IP infrastructure,
     and the establishment on a pan-European scale of an ATM-based test
     network with a clear production service specification in mind. The
     network will expand to include 155 Mbps technology and higher
     bandwidths to maintain a leading-edge capability when required and
     feasible.

     In order to establish advanced facilities, special arrangements are
     being sought with the suppliers of international communication
     links.  This involves the negotiation of special rates as part of a
     collaborative R&D activity which in turn may require constraints to
     be placed on usage, and other special measures.

Internet Monthly Report                                       April 1995


     The network is being developed in a pragmatic fashion, meaning that
     links, nodes and interconnection points are created not only to
     satisfy, as well as possible, national network requirements, but
     also as practically and financially feasible. The requirement for
     intercontinental, specifically transatlantic, connections employing
     similar technology is also being addressed.

     The proposal presents a phased plan to include initially those
     national research networks which already have high speed networking
     requirements, for which international links are available and which
     have sufficient co-funding; other National Networks will join as
     and when they meet these criteria.

     The TEN-34 proposal to the DG III and DG XIII Programme has
     received a favourable evaluation report and the Consortium is now
     working to define a detailed implementation plan with those PNOs
     which have declared their intention to cooperate.

     INTERNIC REGISTRATION SERVICES

     I.  Significant Events

     InterNIC Registration Services assigned over 12,147 network
     addresses and registered over 9,911 domains.  Five top-level
     country domains were registered during April for: Vanuatu (VU),
     Micronesia (FM), Kiribati (KI), and Uzbekistan (UZ).




Cooper                                                         [Page 13]

Internet Monthly Report                                       April 1995


     The suit that Knowledgenet has filed against Network Solutions and
     David L. Boone over the knowledgement.com domain is still pending.
     This case could establish precedence that refutes InterNIC
     Registration Service's current policy of first-come first served by
     binding trademarked names with a domain name.

     During the month of April, the increase of domain requests
     increased from an average of 400+ to 500+ new submissions per day.
     We have made adjustments in domain processing and staffing, as well
     as the implementation of additional equipment to aid in reducing
     the backlog.  At the close of April 1995, the processing time
     decreased from a high of 15 days to 10 days.

     II.  Current Status

     During the month of April 1995, InterNIC Registration Services
     received communications as shown below.  The majority of the
     correspondence concerned the assignment and re-assignment of
     network numbers and the registration or change of domain names.

          E-mail     17,867    (hostmaster@internic.net)
          Postal/Fax    304    (primarily IP number requests)
          Phone       5,462

     The Registrations Services host computer supported a large volume
     of information retrieval requests during the month of April.

                     Connections   Retrievals
          Gopher      56,515          53,675

     INTERNIC DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES

     The net-happenings mailing list is maintained by Gleason Sackman
     and is hosted on dsmail.internic.net.  After soliciting comments
     from the users of the list, Gleason has decided to modify the list
     to make it easier for users to get the information they want while
     cutting down on the overall amount of traffic received.

Internet Monthly Report                                       April 1995


     The main net-happenings list will continue to exist, but a number
     of sub-lists will be set up to address different topics within the
     list.  Users who are interested in a subset of the total list can
     subscribe to one or more of the sub-lists and reduce the amount of
     mail to be read.

     There are now sub-lists for information on new information sites on
     the Internet (net-sites); newsletters and other publications on the
     net (net-zines); conferences, seminars, training, and other events
     (net-events); and other topics (net-misc).  The net-happenings list
     is the sum of net-sites, net-zines, net-events, and net-misc.  Thus
     there is no point in subscribing to any of the sub-lists if you
     subscribe to the main list; you will just get duplicate messages.

     To subscribe to any of the sub-lists send email to
     majordomo@dsmail.internic.net with the subject line blank and with
     the line:

          subscribe <sub-list name>

          in the body of the message.

          Since all the sub-lists are included in the net-happenings
          list, only the full net-happenings list will be archived.

          A reminder - if you would like to help the Internet community
          find a resource that you offer, send mail to
          admin@ds.internic.net and we will send information about
          listing your resource in the Directory of Directories.

MERIT/NSFNET ENGINEERING
------------------------

     This report summarizes recent activities of Merit's Internet
     Engineering and Network Management groups on behalf of the Routing
     Arbiter (RA) Project and the NSFNET Backbone Service Project.

     Farewell NSFNET!  The last of the NSFNET ENSSs was shut down at
     midnight on April 30 in each respective U.S. time zone.  The final
     shutdown went without a hitch, as did most of the events leading up
     to the final dismantling of the NSFNET Backbone Service.  The
     smooth transition was due in large part to independent and
     proactive actions taken by many regional networks, several of whom
     began to terminate their NSFNET connections in March.

     Merit scheduled an initial test of the NSFNET shutdown to uncover
     any potential reachability problems.  The test was postponed for
     several days, but eventually ran successfully on Tuesday, April 25.
     Overall, the retirement of the Backbone Service was quite
     uneventful, with few networks experiencing connectivity problems.
     Many thanks to the regionals for their cooperation since 1988 and
     during the transition to the new frontier!

     Merit's venerable Policy Routing Database (PRDB) will be turned off
     at 09:00 EST on Monday, May 8.  The PRDB has been used to configure
     the NSFNET Backbone Service and ANSNET (AS690) since 1989. After
     May 8, configurations for the ANSNET backbone will be generated
     from the Routing Arbiter Database (RADB).

     The PRDB and the RADB have been running with parallel data for over
     a year.  As of May 8, the last data from the PRDB will be
     transferred to the RADB, and the PRDB will be permanently retired.
     NACRs will no longer be accepted for AS690 configurations; the way
     to submit additions or changes of route announcements for AS690
     will be to submit Route objects by e-mail to auto-dbm@ra.net.  For
     more information, see:

         http://www.ra.net (select Routing Arbiter from the Projects menu)

     Jessica Yu has helped Ameritech Advanced Data Services develop a
     Multi- Lateral Peering Agreement (MLPA) for peers at the AADS NAP.
     She also proposed a mechanism that facilitates implementation of
     the MLPA using the Route Server and the RADB.

     Craig Labovitz has been working with several Network Service
     Providers to develop routing monitoring and analysis tools to

     tools have been incorporated into Labovitz' Multi-Threaded Routing
     Toolkit (MRT), which provides a powerful collection of tools for
     developing and debugging inter-domain routing protocols and
     policies.  More information about MRT is available at:

         http://www.ra.net/routing.arbiter/RT/mrt.html

     Merit is using the bilingual SNMPv1/v2 agent to monitor the Route
     Servers at the three contingency NAPs and the MAE-East facility.
     As far as is known to the network management staff, Merit is the
     first to deploy the SNMPv2 technology in an operational
     environment.  Bill Norton outlined Merit's network management
     strategy in an "SNMP in Your Network" panel at the April
     COMDEX/Spring '95 exposition in Atlanta.
