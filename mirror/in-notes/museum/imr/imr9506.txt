     1. The summer IETF meeting will be held in Stockholm, Sweden the
        week of July 17-21, 1995. Due to the meeting costs, the IETF
        attendance fee for the Stockholm meeting will be US$300.
        Logistic information has already been posted to the IETF
        Announcement list.

        Following Stockholm, the IETF will be meeting in Dallas, Texas
        on December 4-8, 1995. Our local host for this meeting is MCI.
        Once all the arrangements have been made, notifications will be
        sent to the IETF Announcement list. Remember that information
        on future IETF meetings can be always be found in the file 0mtg-
        sites.txt which is located on the IETF shadow directories. This
        information can also be viewed from the IETF Home Page on the
        Web. The URL is:

     EUROPANET TRANSITION

     The issue currently highest on DANTE's agenda is the transition
     process to the new EuropaNET backbone network. In October 1995 a new
     contract with British Telecom for the operation of the European
     backbone will come into force. The huge project of migration to the
     new service involves many partners and DANTE is working very hard to
     coordinate all activities to ensure a smooth transition. According to
     current plans, the routers necessary for the service will be
     delivered in mid-July and most of the necessary circuits will be
     available at the end of July. Acceptance testing and migration of the
     national networks to the new service will take place during
     September. One of the issues that are currently under discussion is
     the possible integration into BT's service of a high speed link to
     the US.

     EUROPANET UPGRADES

     As a result of the ever increasing traffic load on EuropaNET two more
     customers (UKERNA and NORDUnet) have upgraded their connection
     capacity to 4 Mbps. During 1995 traffic on the EuropaNET
     backbone has seen a 30% growth already. Under the current contract
     the national networks have the obligation to increase the capacity of
     their connection as soon as the traffic load reaches a certain level.
     This is one of the ways a high quality of service on the network can
     be guaranteed to all customers. From 1 October 1995, this contractual
     obligation will no longer be in effect but DANTE will still rely on
     individual national networks to upgrade their access capacity as
     necessary in order to maintain an acceptable level of service for
     their end users.

Internet Monthly Report                                        June 1995


     A complication is now presenting itself in the fact that the original
     EMPB infrastructure (and contract) was based on 2 Mbps line and
     switching equipment. As a result an upgrade to 4 Mbps may show less
     of a quality of service improvement than expected. This will only be
     a very temporary problem, as the next contract offers connectivity to
     customer networks up to a speed of 8 Mbps.

     TEN-34 CONSORTIUM

     DANTE is continuing its efforts to finalise the TEN-34 proposal on
     behalf of the TEN-34 Consortium. The Consortium consists of national
     networks from 18 European countries and telecommunications operators
     which have submitted an implementation proposal to the European
     Commission for the linking up of high-speed national research
     networks at 34-155 Mbps. DANTE has been asked by the Commission to
     discuss the proposal with the initiators of JAMES, a PNO-driven
     proposal, which builds on the work done in the European PNO ATM
     pilot. DANTE is currently looking at ways to collaborate with the PNO
     Consortium in relation to the second element of the TEN-34 proposal
     which specifies the setting up of an international ATM test network.
     The immediate establishment of a 34 Mbps IP backbone remains a high
     priority and is being addressed separately.

     THE PHARE PROJECT

     DANTE recently completed an international connectivity plan for the
     PHARE region as part of the PHARE 1994 R&D networking contract. As
     expected, a range of solutions is needed to build a solid base for
     future networking activity in this region. As a result each country
     is being treated to a greater or lesser degree separately from all
     other beneficiaries. The connectivity plan focuses on finding a
     solution for each country which is cost effective on the one hand but
     which provides access to the high capacity and performance networking
     capabilities provided by existing R&D networks on the other.

     DANTE is concerned that progress during the first six month period of
     the contract has been relatively limited due to delays in resolving
     administrative issues in relation to the Management Contract and the
     resulting interruption in the flow of funds from the EC. The members
     of the R&D community in the PHARE countries have expressed their
     concern that a manageable transition from the PHARE/COSINE Programme
     (1991-1994) to meet the needs for R&D networking in 1995 has not been
     taken on urgently enough. As a result, some local initiatives have
     changed the networking status from the situation which existed in
     early 1994 when the Programme was approved. Due to these changes and
     to the increase in networking activity in both Western and Eastern
     Europe in 1994/5 some of the aims of the PHARE R&D Networking
     Programme have already been overtaken by events. The planned change

     of infrastructure supplier for EuropaNET from 1 October 1995 adds an
     extra layer of complication. Effort so far has been concentrated on
     preparatory work in the PHARE countries, the fruition of which DANTE
     expects to become more evident during the next six months.

     REGISTRATION SERVICES

     I.  Significant Events

     InterNIC Registration Services assigned over 5,931 network addresses
     and registered over 13,974 domains.  There were no top-level country
     domains registered during June.

     The suit that Knowledgenet has filed against Network Solutions and
     David L. Boone over the knowledgement.com domain has been dismissed.
     David Boone has agreed to relinquish the domain name to Knowledgenet,
     Inc.

     During the month of June, domain requests are averaging between 600-
     700+ for new submissions per day. Adjustments continue to be made in
     domain processing.  Additional, staffing is being acquired to
     accommodate the growth in registration requests. At the close of June
     1995, the domain processing queue had again increased from 5,000 to
     6,000 new domain registrations.

     Mark Kosters and Kim Hubbard attended the NANOG meeting in Ann Arbor,
     Michigan on June 22-23, 1995.  Mark gave a presentation on the status
     of the InterNIC and the draft IP allocation practices that has been
     created in lieu of the general ip allocation document effort,
     rfc1466bis. RFC1466bis was broken into sections and assigned at RIPE
     in Jan 1995. Both the APNIC and InterNIC portions where completed. The
     RIPE section has not yet been completed. Kim Hubbard has agreed to
     complete the unfinished work in the RIPE section and pull the document
     together for review.

     Mark Kosters attended INET95 to give a presentation on the status of
     the InterNIC.

     The Scout HQ project began at the University of Wisconsin through a
     sub-contract with NSI. Susan Calcari relocated to Madison from San
     Diego and resumed weekly production and distribution of the Scout
     Report. A new Web site for the Scout Report was established on the
     Registration Services Web site, URL:
     http://rs.internic.net/scout_report-index.html.  Computer equipment
     was ordered for the Info Scout and the Assistant Scout, including both
     desktop and laptop computers. Susan assisted NSI in the NIC Liaison
     recruitment process by reviewing approximately 40 resumes and
     recommending which applicants should be considered further.
     Interviews are expected to occur during June.

     II.  Current Status

     During the month of June 1995, InterNIC Registration Services received
     communications as shown below.  The majority of the correspondence
     concerned the assignment and re-assignment of network numbers and the
     registration or change of domain names.

          E-mail     32,350    (hostmaster@internic.net)
          Postal/Fax    309    (primarily IP number requests)
          Phone       4,383

     The Registrations Services host computer supported a large volume
     of information retrieval requests during the month of June.

INTERNIC DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES

     During the period June 19 to June 21, we moved one of our backup
     servers to a new physical location.  ds1.internic.net had been
     located in a research environment in Murray Hill, New Jersey.  It
     has moved to a computer center environment in Holmdel, NJ.  This
     change will make it possible to get more rapid response to
     problems that require physical access to the machine.

     In the new location, ds1 remains physically separated from both
     our other two servers: ds.internic.net (our primary server) in
     South Plainfield, NJ; and ds2.internic.net in Columbus, OH.  This
     physical separation has allowed us to keep at least one server
     accessible to the Internet at all times since we started
     operation.

     ds1.internic.net has retained its DNS name, but its address did
     change as a result of the move.

MERIT/NSFNET ENGINEERING
------------------------

     This report summarizes recent activities of Merit's Internet
     Engineering group on behalf of the Routing Arbiter (RA) Project.

     The Routing Arbiter Database (RADB) is now fully in production, and
     is being used to generate configurations for the ANSNET backbone
     network and the RA project's Route Servers.  Providers worldwide
     now enter data directly in the database; the RADB staff focused
     this month on providing consultation and documentation for those
     users.  Information on the RADB home page,
     http://www.ra.net/routing.arbiter/RA/RADB.tools.docs.html, now
     includes:

          * How to Delete Objects from the RADB
          * How to Query the RADB for Information on Networks, ASs, and
            Maintainers
          * PRDB to RADB Transition
          * How to Register in the RADB (IRR)
          * Updating Maintainer Objects
          * Ripe-181

     Providers now only need to register routing information in one of
     the registries in the Internet Routing Registry.  Currently, these
     include the Routing Arbiter Database and the RIPE NCC, InternetMCI,
     CA*net, and ANS Routing Registries.  User updates to the RADB are
     immediately visible through whois commands such as:

         whois -h whois.ra.net 193.101.106.0
         whois -h whois.ra.net AS800

     Users were notified early this month about two modifications to be
     made to data in the RADB.  First, Route objects without the

     required information about Origin AS (Home AS) were listed on the
     RADB Web pages and then removed from the database.  Next, Route
     objects with advisory lines specifying non-existent peers were
     identified; many of these were entries that had not been modified
     to reflect the retirement of the NSFNET Backbone Service on April
     30.  Users were given the opportunity to modify these objects.
     Data that had not been corrected by the end of June was then
     modified directly by the RADB staff.

     Merit recently modified the RIPE-181 (RFC 1786) code, which is used
     to express routing policy in the Routing Arbiter Database.  The
     code now supports syntax checking for the draft AS path regular
     expressions specified by the IETF Routing Policy System (RPS)
     Working Group.  Merit also continues to add new capabilities to
     'radbserver,' an enhanced whois server that provides information
     collected from all the registries that form part of the Internet
     Routing Registry.

     The number of peering sessions being established with Route Servers
     at the interconnection points continues to grow, as more providers
     take advantage of services offered by this state-of-the-art
     technology.  Information about the status of current Route Server
     peering sessions is available at:

         http://www.ra.net/routing.arbiter/RA/.bgp.peers.html

     CERT, in a follow-up to its security review of RA systems at Merit
     and ISI, visited the MAE-East, Sprint, AADS, and PacBell NAPs and
     MAE-West to advise the RA team on potential security issues with
     the fielded Route Servers.

     This month Jessica Yu presented a paper titled "The U.S. Internet
     Infrastructure and its Evolution" at the Eighteenth Pacific Science
     Conference in Beijing, China.  Laurent Joncheray presented a paper
     titled +A Simple Active Attack Against TCP+ at the Fifth USENIX
     UNIX Security Symposium in Salt Lake City.  Elise Gerich attended
     an NSF- sponsored "Workshop on the vBNS and the Research Agenda for
     Networking and Applications" in Washington D.C.
