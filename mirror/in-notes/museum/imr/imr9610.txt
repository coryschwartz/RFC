INTERNET MONTHLY REPORTS
------------------------

The purpose of these reports is to communicate to the Internet Research
Group the accomplishments, milestones reached, or problems discovered by
the participating organizations.

Each organization is expected to submit a 1/2 page report on the first
business day of the month describing the previous month's activities.
These reports should be submitted via network mail to "IMR@ISI.EDU".

The Internet Monthly Report mailing list is now managed by MajorDomo at
ISI.EDU.  The announcements of new issues on the Internet Monthly Report
are sent to the IETF-Announce list and to this IMR list.

Requests to be ADDED or DELETED from the Internet Monthly report list
should be sent to "majordomo@isi.edu" with the message body either
"subscribe imr" or "unsubscribe imr".

Details on obtaining the current IMR, or back issues, via FTP or EMAIL
may be obtained by sending an EMAIL message to "rfc-info@ISI.EDU" with
the message body "help: ways_to_get_imrs".  For example:

                    IETF Monthly Report for October, 1996


     1. The IETF returns to San Jose, California on December 9-13, 1996.
        Our local host will be cisco Systems. The Secretariat will open
        for registrations the first part of October. The IETF opens 1997
        in Memphis, Tennessee where Federal Express will be the host.
        This meeting will be held April 7-11, 1997. Following Memphis,
        the IETF is we returning to Europe and will met in Munich,
        Germany August 11-15, 1997, hosted by Digi/ISOC.DE. The
        Secretariat is still working on the final meeting of 1997.

        Once all the arrangements have been made, notifications will be
        sent to the IETF Announcement list. Remember that information
        on future IETF meetings can be always be found in the file
        0mtg-sites.txt which is located on the IETF shadow directories.
        This information can also be viewed from the IETF Home Page on
        the Web. The URL is:

                            http://www.ietf.org


     2. The minutes of the IESG teleconferences have been publicly
        available on the IETF Shadow directories since 1991. These
        files are placed in the /ftp/iesg directory.

        The following IESG minutes have been added:

INTERNET PROJECTS
-----------------


INTERNIC
--------

     REGISTRATION SERVICES


     I.  Significant Events

     Help Desk Support

     The following foreign language skills are now available in the
     Call/Processing Center: Spanish, French, Portuguese, Chinese
     (Mandarin), Hindu, Urdu, Punjabi, English, and Canadian; five CSRs
     are available to support the pending Latin NIC with
     Spanish/Portuguese.

     Presentations were viewed by four telecommunications vendors
     regarding available technology for a new PBX/ACD system.

     16 new staff were trained regarding Billing customer service.

     Increasing reports were received indicating that customers are
     receiving busy signals when they call or are being put on hold for
     excessively long times; this was caused by the rapid growth in
     registrations plus the large numbers of invoices and 15-Day Final
     Invoices being sent out; plans are being implemented to correct the
     problems.

     Name Registration Support

     DomReg software enhancements have reduced the number of requests
     that need to be processed manually from about 1,000 to 700 (30%
     improvement).

     The majority of registration processing work was taken over by
     night shift personnel, thereby freeing up more staff to answer Help
     Desk calls during regular business hours.

     Billing Support

     A contract was negotiated and executed to outsource printing and
     mailing of invoices to Osprey Imaging; start date is targeted for
     early November.

Internet Monthly Report                                     October 1996


     A contract was negotiated and executed to outsource the process of
     receiving telephone credit card payments to First Data Call
     Interactive; an automated voice response system will be used; start
     date is targeted for late November.

     A contract was negotiated and executed to outsource the function of
     processing credit card payments with the associated credit card
     companies.  First Data Merchant Services is the company involved;
     credit cards to be accepted are VISA, Master Card, American
     Express, Discover/NOVA, Diners Club, and JCB; start date is
     targeted for late November.

     Workloads continued to accelerate; additional temporary staff was
     added to use all available PCs on the night shift (6 p.m. to
     midnight) and on Saturdays and Sundays.

     IP Support

     Kim Hubbard met with Jon Postel (IANA), David Conrad (APNIC) and
     Daniel Karrenberg (RIPE) in California to discuss IP issues.

     Kim attended the NANOG meeting in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

     Information Services Support

     The process of notifying Admin Contacts for all domain names about
     Revision 2 of the Name Dispute Policy was completed, including a
     minimum of one attempt for each of 291,673 contacts.

     The 15-Minute Training Series was promoted at the EDUCOM 96
     conference in Philadelphia and the ACM-SIGUCCS meeting.

     Possible partners are being explored for implementing a Spanish
     version of the 15-Minute Series.

     Technical work is ongoing to implement First Virtual Two new web
     specialists were hired.

     INTERNIC DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES

     For some time, InterNIC Directory and Database Services has been
     storing the IETF sessions that are broadcast on the MBONE.  These
     sessions could be downloaded and played back at a later time.
     This helped participants who could not listen to the sessions live
     because of other commitments or because of time zone differences.

     The system was somewhat awkward to use because the VAT/RTP format
     used on the MBONE produced multi-megabyte files that had to be
     downloaded to the listener's machine and played back in full.

     We have now implemented a web-accessible version of the recordings
     using Real Audio format.  Using this format, users can listen to
     parts of a session via the web and skip over sections that are not
     of interest.  The Real Audio MBONE recordings may be found at:

                   http://ds.internic.net/mbone/mbone.html

     The current recordings were used during our testing and are from
     the March IETF meeting.  Recordings from the upcoming San Jose
     IETF will be available in December.

Internet Monthly Report                                     October 1996


     To listen to the Real Audio versions, users will have to install a
     Real Audio player.  A free version of the player is available from
     Progressive Networks for a number of different processor/operating
     system combinations at the following URL:

     THE US DOMAIN REGISTRY
     ----------------------
     The US Domain now has an online line registration form.

     Some of the processing of the requests to the third level domain
     name is now automated. In particular, most requests to register
     names in localities already delegated are automatically forwarded
     to the administrator for that locality.

     The US Domain administrator no longer makes direct registrations of
     hosts, and only makes delegations of third or fourth level domain
     names (such as localities).

     A new policy has been added to the criteria for delegating domain
     names under the US Domain:

        It is the intention that the delegation of third level (for
        example, locality) domain names be wide spread to many
        registries.  It is undesirable for one person or organization to
        manage a large part of the third level names in any particular
        geographic or logical area.

        No individual or organization shall have more than 500
        delegations total in the US Domain as a whole, or more than 50
        delegation in any particuilar second level (for example, a
        state).

Internet Monthly Report                                     October 1996


     About the special domains under the state codes.

        The K12, CC, TEC, LIB, STATE, DST, COG and GEN domain under each
        state are established for special purposes (see RFC 1480).

        In addition to the constaint to use them only for the defined
        purpose, each of these special domains is also to delegated only
        to a manager  within the state, and the operation of the
        delegated registry should be non-profit.

        The LIB domain should be managed by a govermental or educational
        library organization.

        Further, it is most appropriate for the K12, CC, and TEC,
        domains to be managed by an educational organization (for
        example, a university or a department of education).

        The STATE domain is most appropriately managed by an agency of
        the state government.  DST and COG should be managed by a
        goverment agency.

        The GEN domain may be delegated to any organization that will
        provide the registration service for free (and remember the
        purpose of the GEN domain is to register statewide non-profit
        organizations).

     To obtain a copy of the list of other delegated localities and
     subdomains not administered by the US Domain Registrar, get the
     file "us-domain-delegated.txt".

Internet Monthly Report                                     October 1996


MERIT INTERNET ENGINEERING
--------------------------

     This report summarizes October 1996 activities of Merit's Internet
     Engineering group on behalf of the Routing Arbiter (RA) service and
     other projects.

     Based on feedback from providers at the exchange points, Jake Khuon
     has developed a mechanism that gives ISPs increased control over
     their Route Server peering sessions.  Two new fields in the Route
     Server Peering Request Template, rs-in and rs-out, can be used to
     specify exactly which routes the Route Server should import and
     export on behalf of each peer.

     The new fields can also be used to enable route-flap dampening and
     specify whether the RS=92s AS number should be inserted into route
     announcements to the peer.  The new fields will eventually be
     proposed as an extension to the RIPE inet-rtr object.  Further
     details are available from:

                   http://www.ra.net/peering.template.html

     Volunteer sites are still needed for Merit's Network Probe Daemon
     (NPD) project, a study of Internet routing patterns using a global
     traceroute matrix. Sites participating in the project are asked to
     run the NPD software, which runs on any standard Unix system. For
     more information, see:

                 http://compute.merit.edu/stats/npd/npd.html

     The NPD software is available from
     ftp://nic.merit.edu/routing.arbiter/tools/npd-1.0.tar.Z.  If you
     are interested in participating, please send e-mail to Dun Liu
     (dunl@merit.edu.) Your help is greatly appreciated!

     Finally, we released the windows versions of our audio tool and
     LBL's video tool, as well as versions of sdr and nte - these last
     two were the "parting gift" from Mark Handley, who has now moved
     from UCL, to ISI (North East).
