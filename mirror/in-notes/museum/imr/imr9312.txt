                  IETF Monthly REPORT for December, 1993

     1. The 28th meeting of the IETF, co-hosted by SESQUINET and Rice
        University, was held in Houston, Texas from November 1-5, 1993.
        The first meeting of the IETF in 1994 will be held in Seattle,
        Washington from March 29 through April 1, 1994. This meeting is
        being hosted by NorthWestNet.

        Following the March 1994 meeting, it looks like the IETF will
        be in Toronto in July, and in the San Francisco Bay Area in the
        fall. Once the final arrangements have been made, notifications
        will be sent to the IETF Announcement list. Remember that
        information on future IETF meetings can be always be found in
        the file 0mtg-sites.txt which is located on the IETF shadow
        directories.

     2. Fred Baker has accepted the Chairmanship of the IAB/IESG
        Nomination Committee. This is the group that will search for
        candidates and make nominations for half of the IAB and IESG
        members. The new members are to take office following the IETF
        meeting in Seattle.

     3. The IESG approved or recommended the following 11 Protocol
        Actions during the month of December, 1993:

        o  Multiprotocol Interconnect on X.25 and ISDN in the Packet
           Mode is now a Draft Standard.

        o  Classical IP and ARP over ATM is now a Proposed Standard.

        o  PPP LCP Extensions is now a Proposed Standard.

        o  Extensions to the Generic-Interface MIB is reclassified as

ANSNET/NSFNET BACKBONE ENGINEERING
----------------------------------

     Network Status Summary
     ======================

     During December '93, the ANSnet Phase-5 T3 network upgrade was
     completed.  The first production gated systems (including the BGP4
     protocol) were installed on the RS/6000 based routers that support
     the T1 trans-atlantic link (CERN - MAE-East).  An extended fiber
     outage occurred in Michigan on December 3rd due to a fiber cut.

     December Backbone Traffic and Routing Statistics
     ================================================

     The total inbound packet count for the T3 network (measured using
     SNMP interface counters) was 46,029,222,164 on T3 ENSS interfaces,
     up 3.0% from November.  The total packet count into the network
     including all ENSS serial interfaces was 52,282,909,913 down 1.1%
     from November.  The maximum number of destinations announced to the
     T3 network during December was 14,802, up 6.6% from November.  The
     number of network destinations configured for announcement to the
     T3 network but were never announced (silent nets) during November
     was 4,978.

     T3 Network Upgrade Progress/Status
     ==================================

     On December 18th, we successfully completed the Phase 5 ANSNet
     deployment.  The major changes accomplished in this upgrade were:

     o      Upgrade of all DS3/HSSI router serial interface adapters (T3
            CNSS and ENSS) to support full DS3 bandwidth.  The router
            adapter bus interface cards were also upgraded to double the
            packet switching rates per interface.

     o      The T3 DSUs on each DS3 interface were replaced with T3Plus
            BMX45 bandwidth managers on T3 CNSS-CNSS circuits and
            Larscom Access-T45 DSUs on a T3 ENSS-CNSS circuit.

     o      The architecture for interconnection among CNSS routers at
            each MCI POP location was upgraded to a common FDDI ring
            from the original point-to-point links architecture.

     As a result of this upgrade, we now have 17 backbone links and 21
     customer attachments running at full T3:

            Seattle - Denver Backbone Link
            Seattle - San Francisco Backbone Link

     Rcp_routed Routing Software Changes
     ===================================

     Toward the end of November rcp_routed began experiencing problems
     where system paging slowed down rcp_routed causing it to allocate
     memory to defer work, which in turn causes more paging.  Several

Internet Monthly Report                                    December 1993


     new rcp_routed versions were deployed on ENSS136 to reduce the
     memory requirements.  Problems on ENSS136 have been eliminated by
     adding more memory and rcp_routed changes to avoid triggering the
     condition.  Release notes are available for anonymous ftp at:
     ftp.ans.net:/pub/info/t3-rcp_routed/Release-Notes.

     Routing Stability Measured on the T3 Network
     ============================================

     Internal routing stability measurements are made by monitoring
     short term disconnect times (disconnects of five minutes duration
     or less).  This is intended as a measure of stability rather than
     complete connectivity.  December stability dropped to levels
     observed in July and August due to problems with rcp_routed, and
     phase-5 scheduled outages.

     Due primarily to paging problems, few nodes experienced less than
     30 minutes of instability for the month.  Significant perturbations
     such as the phase 5 activity on Dec 4, Dec 11, and Dec 18 caused
     paging elsewhere and secondary instability.  On a few occasions
     core circuit link state changes triggered problems. ENSS136 was the
     most affected node, though also affected were ENSS135, CNSS11,
     CNSS65, ENSS139, ENSS131, and to a lesser extent others. There were
     also the usual site power problems.  The breakdown by sites is as
     follows (these figures include instabilities recorded during
     configuration runs):

     There has been steady increase in the external route flap over the
     course of the year.  The measurement method is described in:

       ftp.ans.net:/pub/info/routing-stats/ExternalRouteFlapReports

     The number of times networks are announced as unreachable is
     collected.  The following represents the monthly totals in terms of
     number of networks declared unreachable per hour.

     Plots of the internal routing stability, external peer session
     stability and external route flap are available as the files:

       ftp.ans.net:/pub/info/routing-stats/flap.ps

     A slight reduction in the external route flap in December, and a
     clear reduction in the size of route flap peaks is believed to be
     at least partly due to limited fixed timer based route dampening at
     the ENSSs.  The data itself is collected at a CNSS and so reflects
     the flap after dampening by the ENSS and reflects the load
     redistributed to AS 690 peers taking full routing.

     External peer stability data in December was dominated by the RIPE
     RS peer.  This peer is experimental and does not introduce any
     routes to AS 690.  It is a gated peer and has a configuration that

Internet Monthly Report                                    December 1993


     has now grown in terms of route restrictions to the point where
     gated is unable to remain stable in the presence of route flap.
     Changes to gated to address this are expected to be deployed soon.
     This peer and the ANS experimental gated peers will be removed from
     the raw data in future reports.

     Gated BGP4/CIDR Deployment Update
     =================================

     ANS has been working to meet the proposed BGP4 deployment schedule.
     We have participated on the BGP4 testbed, and in early December we
     deployed gated with BGP4 on the production AS1133 routers
     (DANTE/ANS service between CERN and MAE-East).  We continue to test
     gated with SLSP (AS690 IGP) support on the NSFNET/ANSnet testbed.

     We have had some problems with the Gated SLSP IGP protocol code due
     to performance enhancements that were made in the Gated base code
     that has been successfully deployed on the AS1133 routers.  Since
     overall network stability is the major goal, we have not yet begun
     deployment of Gated on the AS690 routers.  This version of Gated is
     designed to interoperate with the rcp_routed software (the IGP and
     internal BGP).  The SLSP support in Gated allows us to deploy Gated
     without an IGP "flag day" on AS690 routers.

     We expect to get Gated fully deployed on ANSNET/NSFNET routers in
     time for a CIDR transition (class-based routes stop getting
     announced) in mid-February.  We are exploring two contingency plan
     options to provide continued full connectivity in the event that
     other backbones cease announcing class-based routes via BGP4 and
     announce only the aggregates.  The first option is to have the
     AS690 routers point default to our AS1133 router at MAE-East, which
     supports BGP4 now.  Since Rcp_routed (current AS690 routing
     software) has never supported default, this is being added and
     tested, and should be ready in time.  The second contingency plan
     option we are exploring is to establish BGP4 peering sessions
     between AS 1133 and other BGP4 capable systems at MAE-East. AS 1133
     could accept aggregate announcements from its BGP4 peers and be
     configured to announce the class-based routes within the aggregates
     to AS 690.  Either of these contingency options could serve as an
     interim step while AS 690 completes deployment of gated.

     We hope that it will be unnecessary to resort to any contingency
     plan, but realize that some ASs are faced with overwhelming loads
     on their routers and that those AS may have to begin to only
     announce aggregates rather than the dual announcements of
     aggregates and class-based routes by the mid-February timeframe.

     Notable Outages in December '93
     ===============================

            E131 (Ann Arbor) suffered an extended outage due to fiber cut
            on 12/03 (see details below).

            E257 (Creative Cybernetics) suffered an extended power outage
            on 12/04

            E129 (Champaign), E140 (Lincoln) and E138 (Lincoln)
            underwent Phase V upgrade on 12/04

            E131 (Ann Arbor), E132 (Pittsburgh), E137 (Princeton)
            underwent Phase V upgrade on 12/11

            E133 (Ithaca), E134 (Boston), E136 (College Park), E145
            (Fix-East),

            E146 (ARPA) underwent Phase V upgrade on 12/18

            E257 (Creative Cybernetics) suffered extended downtime due to
            circuit maintenance on 12/22

            E179 (Sandia Labs) suffered extended downtime for
            maintenance on 12/27

     Michigan Fiber Cut (12/3):
     -------------------------

            A fiber cut occurred in Michigan on 12/03 fiber due to a
            contractor backhoe.  This affected 87 MCI DS3's.  The outage
            lasted from 11:45 to 17:25 EST for a total of 5 hours and 40
            minutes downtime.  While the Network Operations Center in
            Ann Arbor was isolated from the national network, network
            monitoring continued from the ANS backup NOC in Elmsford.
            There was some blockage of calls to the 1-800 number due to
            reduced capacity into the Michigan area.

            To avoid future outages of a similar nature, MCI has
            implemented a T1 restoration capability that will be
            coincident with their signalling restoration process.
            Presently this requires manual intervention, but should only
            take a few minutes to implement.  A full automated
            restoration capability will be in-place by mid July 1994.

ILAN - ISRAELI NETWORK
-----------------------

     ILAN is currently in the final acceptance stages of a 256kb
     satellite line to PSI to replace our existing 128kb.  We still
     maintain a 64kb fiber line to Europe.

     On a national scale, ILAN has outgrown its 128kb leased line
     backbone and has signed an agreement with the national PTT to be
     the first customer to use its MAN service.  The seven university
     backbone will run on 10Mb/sec Ethernet speeds via the MAN service
     (the only service offered by our PTT - no SMDS yet).

     The first two sites are expected to be operational in February
     1994, with one site following every month thereafter.

     DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES

     InterNIC Directory and Database Services recently redesigned our
     guest user login to make the menu match our Gopher menu more
     closely.  To try out this interface, telnet to our server
     (ds.internic.net) and log in as "guest" or "newuser".  No password
     is required.

     Once you have logged in, a menu will be presented.  You can choose
     the item you want by entering its number.  You should choose item 1
     (User Tutorial) if you haven't used this interface before.

     The guest login allows telnet users to do WAIS searches of our
     Directory of Directories, search for Internet documents (RFCs,
     etc.) by name (e.g. "rfc1234") or by content (using WAIS), search
     for individuals (using X.500, WHOIS, or Netfind), and search for
     specific files using archie.  You can also access a telnet-based
     Gopher client and use it to browse through the InterNIC Gopher.

     We are interested in comments on the interface and on our services;
     when you leave the guest login you will be asked if you would like
     to leave a comment.  If you would like a reply, please include your
     email address as part of your comment.

     A reminder - if you would like to help the Internet community find
     a resource that you offer, send mail to admin@ds.internic.net and
     we will send information about listing your resource in the
     Directory of Directories.

     MULTIMEDIA CONFERENCING

     The mmcc session orchestration tool was first released in October
     to run on Sun Sparcs.  It allows a caller to explictly invite
     others to participate in a point-to-point or multipoint
     teleconference, and alerts them to accept or decline.  It
     automatically spawns underlying audio, video and groupware programs
     among members of a session, then tears them down at session
     completion.

MERIT/MICHNET
-------------

     Whirlpool Corporation of Benton Harbor, Albion College, and Grand
     Rapids Baptist College and Seminary became new MichNet affiliates
     during the month of December.  Whirlpool will initially have a
     9.6Kbps direct dial-up line through Andrews University.  The Albion
     College proposal to the National Science Foundation for Connections
     grant funding was approved, and work on a 56Kbps link to the
     MichNet backbone has begun.  Grand Rapids Baptist College, an
     institution of Christian higher education serving over 1,000
     students from more than 20 states and eight countries, will also
     have a 56Kbps link to MichNet.  Activity to upgrade MichNet links
     from 56Kbps to T1 at both the University of Michigan's Dearborn
     campus and Eastern Michigan University is also underway.

     Michigan's Governor John Engler has signed Executive Orders
     entitled "Michigan Council on Telecommunications Services for
     Public Education," which address the need for educational
     telecommunications projects that will promote the development of
     integrated educational telecommunications networks, distance
     learning, video conferencing and data networks, and make such
     distance learning technologies available to Michigan students,
     educators, governmental agencies, health providers, and businesses.

     The funding for this state-wide distance learning initiative totals
     $23,230,000, plus interest, and resulted from a Michigan Public
     Service Commission order that Michigan Bell Telephone Company
     either refund $10.5 million of its ratepayers' shareable earnings
     plus interest, or match that sum with a voluntary contribution of
     $10.5 million and the sum total would be used to fund educational
     telecommunications projects.  The Commission found that such a
     settlement agreement was in the public interest, and will provide
     significant funds for such educational telecommunications projects.

     THE DIGITAL CITY (DE DIGITALE STAD)
     Amsterdam, Netherlands
     3 January 1994

     THE DIGITAL CITY

     In the Netherlands on the 15th of January 1994 a new city will be
     born, a digital city. This digital city can be visited by compu-
     ter and modem, and is connected to the worldwide computernetwork
     called Internet.

     The Digital City is an initiative of Cultural Center The Balie and
     Hacktic Netwerk and is supported by the city of Amsterdam.  The aim
     of the Digital City is to investigate the possible contribution of
     (data)communication to debates about the future of the city. The
     project runs from the 15th of January 1994 till the end of March
     and covers the period, in which local elections will be held in
     Amsterdam.

     The Digital City can be reached on phone number +31-20-6225222 (by
     modem); access is free, apart from the normal telephone costs.
     Internet address: telnet dds.hacktic.nl

     Public terminals

     Visitors can call in by their own computer, but there will also be
     a few public terminals in Amsterdam, from where you can reach the
     Digital City. These terminals will be placed in the city hall, the
     public library, the Amsterdam Medical Centre, De Balie, the
     Stedelijk Museum and other locations.

     Internet

     The Digital City explores a new territory for the Netherlands,
     while at the same time it is using the knowledge and experience
     which have been gathered in the United States during the past ten
     years. At the present moment there are some 15 million users of the
     Internet, among which most Dutch universities. The Digital City is
     constructed along the lines of the so-called 'Freenet- systems'
     that exist in the U.S. These are free information servi- ces, which
     give citizens access to various networkfacilities.

     The Amsterdam city hall 'on line'

     The Amsterdam city hall will be part of the network. Administra-
     tive information of the city council will be accessible in the
     Digital City. Various members of the city council and other
     political representatives will participate in the discussions which
     will take place in the Digital City. In the Digital City all
     parties will have their own offices, from where they can distribute
     their election programmes, positions on current issues and other
     information in digital form.

     Participation in electronic discussions

     In the Digital City the visitor can also join discussion groups,
     apart from looking through digital archives. Discussions will be
     held about Schiphol (the Amsterdam airport), cultural issues,
     building and breaking in the city, the elections, income poli-
     tics, etc.

     Exploring the Internet

     Visitors can explore the Internet. Whether you are interested in
     libraries in Japan or in Finland, or in paying a visit to the White
     House, or in the latest NASA-information: you just have to hit a
     few keys on your computer and you can travel around the world.

     Visitors can become builders

     The Digital City offers organisations and individuals the oppor-
     tunity to develop new territories. The citizens can react, bring in
     new ideas and propose changes. The Digital City will partly be
     built in cooperation with its residents and visitors.

     Information brochure

     In the second week of January 1994 an extensive information
     brochure will appear. Apart from that there will be a Dutch manual
     for the Digital City and a 'helpdesk' where you can ask questions
     during the project.

     Other activities / Smart TV

     Various activities will take place in the orbit of the project.
     Smart TV will broadcast four programmes on the local television
     channel of Salto (on the 15th of January, the 5th and the 26th of
     February and the 26th of March 1994), which will deal with the
     developments surrounding the new information technologies.  On the
     26th of March 1994 a symposium will be held in De Balie.

     Thanks

     The Digital City was made possible by (among others) the city of
     Amsterdam, the NLnet Foundation, Tornado Modems and Dataman.

     Technical data

     The Digital City will be run at Hacktic Netwerk on a Solair 10/30
     with 4.8 GB of diskvolume. 12 Tornado HighSpeed modems are
     connected to it through a terminalserver. The Solair is running
     Solaris 1.1 Unix with FreeNet software on it. A Gopher-client is
     used for the connection with the Internet, which is made possible
     by the NLnet Foundation. The modems are lent out for the period of
     the project by Tornado.

     The end of MICE 1 project demonstration featured multisite,
     multiprotocol, multimedia conferencing across a large portion of
     Europe with some input from the US (thanks to LBL). Although
     international bandwidth is still insuffiient for really good
     quality conferences, the feasiability was shown clearly enough, and
     the plans for 34Mbps and better IP and ATM connectivity will be
     boosted by such demonstrations.

     A simple tool for monitoring mbone quality for continuous media
     traffic was made available to the Internet community for trials.
     Further tools are very near completion and will be released early
     in the new year.

   1.1.1  David Hartland, University of Newcastle Upon Tyne
          "Sowing the Networking Seed: The Gardener's Experience"

      The networking world is continuing to grow at a fast rate and
      there are still a large number of disciplines in the academic and
      research community which have yet to discover and benefit from
      them.  The User Support Activities of the Networked Information
      Services Project (NISP) intends to plant the seeds of computer
      networking in some of these disciplines and nurture the seeds to

Internet Monthly Report                                    December 1993


      grow.

      One of NISP's goals is to support and encourage common training
      materials.  One way NISP is accomplishing this is to globally
      search for other materials to incorporate into their materials.
      Many groups experience frustration when the tools don't work or
      aren't available.  It is the user support groups' responsibility
      to assist in finding the right sources.

      Some common problems NISP has encountered is that computer
      literacy isn't, at times, on the highest level.  Additionally,
      some sites have poor or very poor connectivity.  Lack of
      documentation is another problem, along with support people having
      the lack of time to produce documentation.  One suggestion to this
      dilemma is that target groups should be encouraged to use mailbase
      services at all different stages and at all levels.

      The social sciences field is the best group to work with, as they
      have reference cards, documentation, networked information office
      postings, and work closely with the NISP.  The librarian community
      has the initial contact with JANET (Joint Academic Network).
      JANET is an organized, central group that concentrates on the
      training aspect.  JANET also has joint activities with NISP.  The
      higher education administration is the group that is the hardest
      to get started, basically because there are lots of suspicions to
      overcome in this community.  Security aspects are what they are
      most concerned about.

      The key features of NISP is that they do have limited resources,
      the mailbase factor, and liase with other national projects in the
      UK.  The key factors in working with groups in other disciplines
      are:

            first contact
            focal point
            publicity
            training and support

      The passport to success includes:

            good connectivity
            geographically spread
            the need to communicate
            coordinated group
            funding
            getting key people involved
            enthusiasm and persistence

   1.1.2  Margaret Issacs - University of Newcastle Upon Tyne
          "Issues in Training Users to Use the Network"

      Issues in training users to use the network and general issues in
      network training was the format of this talk, with specific
      reference to the work of the UK Network Training Materials
      Project, which is developing a generic mix and match set of
      network training materials for users in UK universities.

      The general issues include the increase in demand for training,
      various user requirements, the hazards of being on-line, and the
      effectiveness of training.  There is an enormous widening spectrum
      of users as the network grows.  The expectations of users are
      rising along with the volatility of network service, as there are
      constant changes.  The network trainer needs to address this issue
      as well as the continuous upgrades of hardware and software.  The
      main hazard of going on-line is that many things can go wrong,
      including the network, remote services, and local conditions.  In
      the effectiveness of training, a lot of resources and investment
      and the increase of community awareness make it effective.

      Within the Network Training Materials Project is the Informational
      Technology Training Initiative (ITTI).  In the UK context, the
      initiative's intent is to stimulate the use of computers,
      computing, teaching and training, and increased requirements and
      demands.  For example, The JANET IP services have come on-line,
      and dominates its use with Telnet, FTP, Gopher, WWW, etc.  In
      addressing the issues, the scope is to optimize the investment in
      network training by looking at the training materials that are
      already developed in the international community, to seek out
      community input, and then pooling this material.

      The ITTI team seeks community input and feedback, and shares the
      information.  Generic network training materials are used
      extensively by trainers at local sites.  The materials have a
      copyright, specifically for non-commercial users.  The pooling of
      on-line materials is obtained via anonymous FTP.  In regards to
      dealing with volatility issues, it is most important to keep
      current through mailing lists, conferences, and to help to keep
      the trainers up to date.  Coping with on-line hazards requires
      testing, testing, testing!  (Included in the effectiveness is to
      get feedback from users.)  Always evaluate!

      In summary, there is an increased demand for training and
      centralized production of training materials.

   1.1.3  Daniele Bovio - EARN

          "The EARN Help Desk: A Pilot in International End User
          Support"

      NETHELP is an international net-consulting Help Desk service
      accessible via email for user support personnel and end-users
      alike.  This service is available to EARN (European and Academic
      Research Network) members.  The NETHELP services filters users,
      creates tickets, ACKs receipts, and handles "help" mailings.
      There is a Network Consultation Team (NCT) that is made up of four
      consultants (IT, BE, HU, US).  Five people are on staff that work
      through LISTSERV and handle questions.  The result is that NETHELP
      fielded 200 tickets from 25 countries.  All were received and all
      were answered.  Quality of service is stressed in this endeavor.
      Each query was always answered with a dated receipt, and there was
      never an answer of, "we don't know the answer".  95% of the global
      queries were answered on the same weekday.  Most questions were
      fielded from Romania and Russia, as the large majority of ticket
      work came from countries that are still organizing their
      countries.

      The most frequently asked question was, "How do I get this
      person's email address?".  A program called, "trickle" allows you
      to receive information about PC software.  Trickle was the most
      frequently used program, and had the most queries in this pilot,
      as the EARN members have the largest ratio of PCs.  In addition,
      many users do not have full Internet access, just email services.

      The results of this pilot was that this service did not take off
      in advanced countries, as it was not advertised as much.  The
      countries who had local help services available felt that the
      EARN's NETHELP service was competition.  There was also a language
      problem from country to country, as EARN's official language is
      English.  The service was quite popular in countries that didn't
      have local help desks.  The main conclusion is that this service
      needs advertisement.  EARN published a leaflet that was available
      at this conference that explained about NETHELP and what it is.

   1.2.2  David Goodman - University College London
          "Paradise in Transition"

      X.500 towards a global directory...is this a dream or reality?
      Can it be done?  The Paradise Project shows the foundation can be
      done, but will the end result of X.500's intent be seen in our
      lifetime?  Do we really want it?  Or, does it smack of Orwell's
      "1984"?

      In the last 26 months, COSINE has provided the funding for the
      Paradise Project.  The criteria for success was the X.500 pilots
      and a market for X.500 products.  This has not yet been satisfied.
      Another project is needed, including a transition phase which
      would include:

            continuation of control services
            enhancement
            interworking testing
            international coordination

         pilots.  There is a fairly complete picture of national pilots
         in Western and Central Europe.  There is a world directory with
         47 pilots, with the US being the largest.  There are 600
         interconnected Directory Services worldwide.  50% in Europe and
         20% in the US.  The rest is scattered throughout the world.

            X.500 works
            There will be a next year continuation of Paradise
            Coordination by research networks
            Focused user oriented guidelines
            Quality control of the Directory
            Guidelines need to be given
            Look at diverse application of X.500
            Yellow Pages
            Security certification authorities

      A European Directory Forum has been established.  Therefore, a
      global directory is both a dream and a reality.  The technology
      exists, but there are still lots of problems.  Vendors are slow to
      respond.  It will take a five to ten year timeframe to provide a
      coherent directory.  This is due to cultural, not technical
      problems.  There was a question from Rolf Nordhagen (NO) about the
      differences between X.500, WHOIS and WHOIS++.  David responded
      that the two protocols haven't met face to face yet, but that
      there will be a confrontation eventually.  X.500 is slow to come
      around, and WHOIS was not considered competitive until about a
      year ago.

1.3  Network for Schools Session

   1.3.1  Panel Session - "Internet School Networking: A Global
          Perspective"

      Unfortunately, three of the four slated panelists were not at the
      conference.

   1.3.2  European School Project - Henk Sigre

      The European School Project (ESP) is a support system for
      secondary schools to explore application of educational
      telematics.  ESP wanted to use the network to enhance education,
      and started with this project.  The project started in 1989 with
      two schools, one in Amsterdam and another in a small town in
      British Columbia, Canada.  The two schools were connected to
      communicate about their schools.  Both schools are totally
      different in their environments.

      The network connection was not just made for the benefit of the
      students to just chat about the weather, etc.  "Teletrips" were
      developed in this program.  Before a Teletrip could begin, the
      teachers would communicate with each other over the network about
      the agenda for each Teletrip session.  These Teletrips were also

   Technical Implementations Included:

         Focus on email processing
         Using the Internet
         File Storage
         Local Resources
         Mail Front Ends
         Technical Support
            (Technical support is very difficult.  This type of support
            is needed in schools to help teachers with data
            communication.)

   Technical Problems Included:

            Non-ASCII Characters
            Technocentric User Interfaces
            Computer Equipment
            Restricted Format of Messages
            Data Communication
            Reliability of the Connection

      In summary, remember to be flexible and not afraid to change
      things.

      George Brett (US) mentioned in this session that in the United
      States there is an effort underway called, "The Global
      Schoolhouse", and that he was willing to discuss this project
      off-line with the session attendees.

   1.3.3  Lee Caldwell (US) from Novell provided a demonstration of the
          use of the Internet in school networking.

1.4  User Support Session 2

   1.4.1  Robert Cailliau  - CERN
          "World Wide Web (WWW)"

      Robert demonstrated WWW at various sites around the globe.  From
      Honolulu to Chicago he showed how easy it was to go around the
      world using WWW.  WWW is a general hypertext model, with the
      ability to search.  Robert used the Honolulu Community College
      site as an example.  The architecture of WWW is that it splits the
      servers from the clients.  The travel is between an SGML (Standard
      Generalized Markup Language) document.  It has a gateway to get to
      other services via a gateway metro (archie, WAIS, Gopher, WWW,
      FTP, Internet News, etc.)  Documents are spread all over the net,
      via links.  If there are slow links, there are slow responses.

Internet Monthly Report                                    December 1993


      Robert announced the formation of the European Consortium of WWW.
      He is forming it, as he sees a need to develop a commercial
      quality software group of existing professionals in Europe.  Why?
      Concentrate efforts and resources.  How does ATM influence it?
      Needs better reliability.  Robert stated that WWW is a welcome and
      necessary edition to schools and libraries.

      There was a discussion between George Brett and Robert Cailliau in
      regards to commercial versus non-profit environments.  George
      mentioned that CNIDR (Clearinghouse for Networked Information
      Discovery and Retrieval) was founded to prevent orphan software,
      and that the software is freely available to the public, and from
      a non-profit environment, not just specifically coming from the
      commercial sector.

   1.4.2  David Sitman - EARN
          "EARN Documents"

      EARN document availability is by electronic mail via:
      listserv@EARNCC.BITNET.

            get DOC file List
            get EARN brochure
            get NETTOOLS.TXT

      EARN documentation started two years ago, and is specifically
      concerned with NJE (Network Job Entry) users.  The EARN User
      Support group is not protocol bound, as not everyone has FTP,
      Telnet, or NJE.  However, everyone does have email.

      EARN's "Guide to Network Resource Tools" is in its second edition,
      and was made available at this conference.

   1.4.3  Joyce K. Reynolds - Information Sciences Institute
          "Panel Discussion on User Support Issues"

      Joyce Reynolds (US) chaired the user support forum session, which
      included the following panelists: Bert Stals (NL), Jill Foster
      (UK), David Sitman (IL), and Robert Cailliau (CH/F)

      The session encouraged audience participation, besides
      participation from the panelists.  Issues included:

         - What has become of last year's conclusions (i.e., closer
           cooperation with the networking community and librarians)?
         - Flea market versus department store
         - Cost of information versus free information (and the relation
           with quality)
         - Have we lost control of the network?

      During the allotted time, there was a spirited round robin
      discussion of the above issues, with each panelist making a brief
      opening statement, then opening up the discussion to the audience.

2.  The RARE ISUS Working Group Meetings

   The RARE Information Services and User Support (ISUS) Working Group,
   chaired by Jill Foster, met in tandem with EARN's Network Services
   Conference (NSC).  The first meeting was held all day on the 11
   October.  The second meeting was held the afternoon of 15 October.
   Introductions were made around the meeting room and the agenda items
   were discussed.  ISUS identified points for collaboration:

         Start small - identify 2-3 concrete items
         Get volunteers who will work as a two way link
         Network "mentors" - are overloaded, but are experts in their
                             field
         Take part within European countries
         Enlighten people within local countries about ISUS' work
         Raise national projects to a European level
         Look inwards and outwards
         Consider an ISUS group in your own country.

   2.1  Documentation Task Force

      Bert gave an overview of the progress of the Documentation Task
      Force.  Defining goals and writing the short introductory
      pamphlets on WAIS, WWW, Gopher, email, etc., had been successful.
      However, the short guides had not really taken off and had been
      overtaken by events.

      Judy Koren (IL) mentioned that there is a real need for
      documentation in other languages than the "default" language of
      English.  Will this ISUS Task Force assist in this need?  Jill
      commented that the aim of this Task Force is to provide short
      leaflets and that other countries can feel free to translate the
      leaflets for their own user groups, with the stipulation that they
      put the results out on the network.  Bert added that it is not the
      intention to set up a new line of documentation, but to improve
      existing material.

   2.2  Brief report on Document Delivery by Maria Heijne (NL)

      A Document Delivery Task Force was supposed to be formed back at
      the NSC meetings in Pisa, Italy.  Maria submitted a report, but
      with no response back except from the UK.  Last June, Maria
      submitted another report, and did receive some response, but not
      from any of the ISUS group.  She is now asking again for ideas.

   2.3  ISUS Newsletter

      Anders Gillner was producing one, but did a lot of the work by
      himself.  He needs assistance.  Maria volunteered to help by
      sending items of interest to the ISUS list.

   2.4  INET/JENC94 Meeting in Prague

      Jill announced that she was asked to Chair the "User Support and
      Applications" track of the INET/JENC94 meetings in Prague.  She
      has accepted and asked Joyce Reynolds to co-chair with her in this
      endeavor.  Joyce has accepted the invitation to co-chair.  Jill
      and Joyce requested ideas on papers from the ISUS WG.

   2.5  Coordination of Information Services in Europe

      Anders Gillner and Tom Verschuren (NL) led a discussion on the
      Gopher issues.  There is a European Gopher structure set up.
      Stockholm is the starting place with national entry points.
      Additional discussion included:

         Status reports
         Coordination
         National Veronicas
         National Entry Points
         Quality of Service
         Maintaining information
         Next Generation of Gopher - more to do?

      The IETF's "Integrated Information Architecture" concept was
      brought up by Erik Huizer (NL) and Joyce Reynolds.  More
      discussion on this topic will be at the Houston IETF.  Anders
      queried if there were any CNI (Coalition for Networked
      Information) type initiatives in Europe.  No one currently knew of
      any.

2.6  Reports on EARN, IETF and RARE activities

   Current reports were presented by representatives of EARN, RARE, and
   the IETF in the area of user support.

   2.6.1  David Sitman (EARN)

      David stated that EARN covers a larger geographical area than RARE
      which includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  EARNINFO
      meetings are usually attended by those also attending the EARN
      technical group meetings, and are not specifically made up of user
      support people.  The real work is performed by a paid staff.
      EARNINFO focuses on general end user issues and makes no
      distinction between the NJE and the Internet users.  As the use of
      NJE is still growing in new countries (NJE still proves to be a
      good, quick startup for international networking) there is still a
      need for documentation.  As to the issue of EARN cooperation with
      RARE/ISUS initiatives, David stated that a merger between the two
      is not impossible and could be desirable, but on the other hand
      something may also be said of healthy competition.

   2.6.2  Jill Foster (RARE)

      RARE ISUS Working Group covers a broad range of people and
      activities where most of the work is done in task forces.  It is a
      volunteer effort and is open to everyone interested in
      participating.  Current activities and task forces include:

          - RARE Technical Report 1 (RTR1): an up to date status report
            of user support and information services in Europe
          - UNITE: User Network Interface To Everything
          - MultiMedia Information Services
          - Networked Information Retrieval (Tools and Groups) report
          - Co-ordination of Networked Information Retrieval Services in
            Europe
          - User Documentation
          - Document Delivery
          - Network Training Materials
          - Support for Special Interest Groups
          - User Requirements of Automatic Mail Based Servers

Internet Monthly Report                                    December 1993


      2.6.3  Joyce Reynolds (IETF)

      The IETF was originally a technically oriented group, but as of
      March 1990, User Services efforts were formed as its own separate
      area.  The IETF User Services Area is made up of a User Services
      Area Council, the User Services Working Group (USWG), which is the
      umbrella group that spawns new working groups in this area, and
      various other working groups.  The aim of the User Services Area
      is to enhance the cooperation of user support in internetworking.
      The User Services Area provides information for the people doing
      the first level user support.  It is seen as a second level
      provider of user support.

      Joyce mentioned the following list of working groups and projects
      that are currently underway as part of the IETF User Services
      Area:

          - IAFA (Internet Anonymous FTP Archives)
          - IDS  (Integrated Directory Services)
          - IIIR (Integration of Internet Information Resources)
          - ISN  (Internet School Networking)
          - NIR  (Network Information Retrieval)
          - NISI (Network Information Services Infrastructure)
          - TRAINMAT (Network Training Materials)
          - URI  (Uniform Resource Identifiers)
          - USERDOC (User Documentation)
          - USWG (User Services Working Group)
          - WNILS (WHOIS and Network Information Lookup Service)

      Many of these projects and activities have produced documentation
      that have been published as "FYI RFCs" (For Your Information).
      FYIs are a subseries of the RFC series of notes. FYIs are
      introductory and overview documents for network users.  Their
      purpose is to make available general information, rather than the
      protocol specifications or standards that is typical of other
      RFCs.  Joyce commented that there are currently 21 FYIs, including
      FYI 19, "FYI on Introducing the Internet-- A Short Bibliography of
      Introductory Internetworking Readings", (Also RFC 1463), May 1993.
      The IETF User Services Area and the RARE ISUS WG continue to work
      in parallel and in a complementary fashion, with coordination
      between Jill and Joyce.

   2.7  Network Training Materials Task Force

      Jill introduced the Network Training Materials Task Force which is
      a joint Working Group with the IETF and liaises with Australian
      groups.  This work is based heavily on the UK's NISP/ITTI Network
      Training Materials Project based in Newcastle (see section 1.1.2



Cooper                                                         [Page 45]

Internet Monthly Report                                    December 1993


      for further information).  Margaret Issacs (UK), the Project
      Officer, gave an overview of this work.  The aims of the RARE/IETF
      Network Training Materials Task Force/Working Group and the ITTI
      Project activities are to make a catalogue of already available
      training materials and make this available to the network
      community.  The catalogue will soon be available as an Internet-
      Draft.

      The Newcastle group is also developing the following network
      training materials:

      Item 1:  "The World From Your Desk Top"

      This is already available with:

            - Presentations
            - Demos
            - Handouts
            - Workshop material

      Item 2:  "Slicing Through the Maze of Networked Information

      Item 3:  "Electronic Mail"

      Margaret made a call for volunteers to update the collection that
      has already been put together for the catalogue and to provide
      feedback on the Training Pack.

   2.8  Support Discussion Subject Groups Task Force - Jill Foster

   2.8.1  United Kingdom

      David Hartland (UK) reported that NISP target groups have been set
      up (see section 1.1.1 for further information).

   2.8.2  The Netherlands

      Bert gave a status report on support activities for SIGs (Special
      Interest Groups).  SURFnet has a low profile attitude, and they
      wait for groups to come to them.  If SURFnet receives a help
      request from a potential SIG, they can assist in making project
      plans.  Two projects have already been completed and two are still
      running.

   2.8.3  Germany

      Monika Roesler (DE) reported that in some cases, group support
      from DFN is in the form of hardware and software.  They have one
      person funded for two years for training and motivating members,
      and to hold meetings.  They've discovered that user groups would
      die out once the project leader departed.

   2.8.4  United Kingdom

      Nicky Ferguson (UK) is the Networked Information Officer for the
      ESRC (Economic and Social Sciences Research Council).  He
      encourages the use of networked information in the social science
      community.  He works in collaboration with David Hartland of the
      NISP.  He has produced a card referring to services over JANET
      that are of relevance to social scientists.  This has been
      distributed very widely.  Nicky also runs hands-on sessions so
      computer naive users can get accustomed to the computers, provides
      interaction with faculty members, and attention to the resources.
      There has also been an establishment of a social sciences Gopher.
      A National Information on Software and Services (NISS) group has
      been funded by the "Funding Body for Social Sciences", with Jill's
      assistance.

   2.9  The Euromath Project - Flemming Topsoe (DK)

      This project was started in Warsaw and is ten years old.  The aim
      is to create a homogeneous workstation environment for editing
      mathematical documents and for email.  This includes the creation
      of a homogenus workstation and DTDs (Document Type Definitions)
      with the main emphasis on the editing side.  On-going work
      includes a hypertext help system and an electronic mailer.  It
      runs full SGML and the development portion is available.  Euromath
      Version 1 will be released January 1994, which will include
      Gopher, WAIS and WWW.

      Ongoing work includes:

            hypertext help system
            electronic mailer
            personal file system (for accessing and creating databases)

   2.10  U.N.I.T.E. - George Munroe (UK)

      George Munroe led the UNITE (User Network Interface To Everything)
      discussion.  UNITE started as a small closed group, but became an
      ISUS Task Force one year ago at the NSC in Pisa.  It is an idea of
      a total service in the sense that the user would not have to learn
      many different interfaces or to know which tool to use to find the
      information he/she is looking for on the network.

      The scope and goals included:

         What an ideal interface should be? (Started last November)
         What systems are already out there?
         Benchmark tests for evaluating systems
         Evaluate these solutions
         Only 8-9 catalogue of review
         Dissemination of reports

      Question from George, "Should we continue?  If so, how?"

         UNITE files
         Evaluation reports (in the UNITE archive)
         Evaluation of UNITE - new things or stay as they are?
         Protocols essential for networking people - that's it
         Put it out to a "real" user - any volunteers?
         Any topics to introduce on the list
         Not much input on information management
         Should UNITE be thinking about it? - Probably YES.

      The attendees agreed that the UNITE work should go on. The work
      and discussions on the list are highly appreciated and George was
      thanked for his efforts.
