                   IETF Monthly Report for August, 1994

     1. The 30th meeting of the IETF was held in Toronto, Ontario,
        Canada from July 25 through July 29, 1994. The meeting was
        hosted by The University of Toronto. There were just over 700
        attendees, and over 70 Working Groups, BOFs, and directorate
        meetings were held during the week.

        The next IETF meeting will be in San Jose, California from
        December 5-9, and is being hosted by Sun. Following that, the
        IETF will be meeting in Danvers, Massachusetts (a suburb of
        Boston) from April 3-7, 1995. This meeting is being co-hosted
        by FTP Software and NEARNet.

     2. We are in the final stages of arranging the summer IETF meeting
        which will be held in Stockholm, Sweden, from July 17-21, 1995.
        Our hosts for the second European IETF meeting is NORDUnet. When
        all the arrangements have been made, a notice will be sent to
        the IETF Announcement list.

        Remember that information on future IETF meetings (both
        tentative and confirmed), can be always be found in the file
        0mtg-sites.txt which is located on the IETF shadow directories.
        This and other IETF information can also be viewed via the
        World-Wide Web. The URL for the IETF Home page is

           http://www.ietf.cnri.reston.us/home.html

     3. The IESG approved or approved the following two Protocol Actions
        during the month of August, 1994:

        o  The PPP Multilink Protocol (MP) be published as a Proposed
           Standard.

        o  Transport Multiplexing Protocol (TMux) be published as a
           Proposed Standard.


     4. The IESG issued ten Last Calls to the IETF during the month of
        August, 1994:

ANSNET/NSFNET BACKBONE ENGINEERING
----------------------------------

     NETWORK STATUS SUMMARY
     ----------------------

     ANSnet total packet traffic increased by about 13% in August'94.
     An increase in the ANSnet forwarding table size of 5.5% was
     observed during the month of August.

     AUGUST BACKBONE TRAFFIC STATISTICS
     ----------------------------------

     The total inbound packet count for the ANSnet (measured using
     SNMP interface counters) was 70,954,833,675 on T3 ENSS
     interfaces, up 13.5% from July.  The total packet count into the
     network including all ENSS serial interfaces was 71,692,393,856 up
     13.0% from July.

     ROUTER FORWARDING TABLE STATISTICS
     ----------------------------------

     The maximum number of destinations announced to the ANSnet
     during August was 18,846 up 5.56% from July.

     The number of network destinations configured for
     announcement to the ANSnet but never announced (silent nets)
     during August was 17,153.

     BGP-4/CIDR DEPLOYMENT STATUS
     ----------------------------

     As of September 7th '94, we have observed the withdrawal of
     7,714 class based destinations from the ANSnet router forwarding
     tables that are now represented by 1,518 configured aggregates.
     Among these configured aggregates:

        1,319 of these are top-level aggregates (not nested in another
        aggregate).

        1,081 of these are actively announced to ANSnet.

        885 of these have at least one subnet configured (the other
        196 may be saving the Internet future subnet announcements).

Internet Monthly Report                                      August 1994


        762 of these have resulted in the withdrawal of at least one
        configured more specific route.

        742 of these have resulted in the withdrawal of 50% of their
        configured more specific routes.

        717 of these have resulted in the withdrawal of most (80%+)
        of their more specific routes.

     For up-to-date information is available from merit.edu:
     pub/nsfnet/cidr/cidr-savings.

     For further details on these CIDR aggregates, see
     merit.edu:pub/nsfnet/cidr/nestings.announced for full listings.

     ROUTING STABILITY MEASURED ON THE T3 NETWORK
     --------------------------------------------

     Internal routing stability measurements are made by monitoring
     short term disconnect times (disconnects of five minutes duration
     or less).  This is intended as a measure of overall system
     stability rather than complete connectivity.

     The month of August resulted in greater backbone stability than any
     other month during the year.  Some instability was experienced due
     to planned maintenance required to install new router operating
     system software, along with unexpected problems with a gated bug
     during reconfiguration.

     2 MBPS EUROPANET CONNECTION FOR NORDUNET

     Since 1 July 1994 NORDUnet, the network of the Nordic countries,
     has had a 2 Mbps connection to EuropaNET. Belgium, Germany, Italy,
     The Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom already had 2 Mbps
     connections.

     NEW EBONE GATEWAY ARRANGEMENT

     DANTE has organised a new interconnect arrangement between Ebone
     and EuropaNET, which has been in place since 1 July 1994. The
     arrangement enables France to communicate with the rest of Europe
     and vice versa; the interconnection has a capacity of 512 kbps.
     CERN (Geneva), as one of the locations where EuropaNET and Ebone
     are both present, is used as the actual point of interconnection
     but traffic flows in and out of EMPB through DANTE's PoP in
     Amsterdam.

     CONNECTIVITY IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE

     The contract between the European Commission and PTT Telecom to
     provide EMPB (EuropaNET) connections to the Czech Republic,
     Hungary, and Romania under the EC PHARE Programme was extended from
     31 December 1993 to 30 June 1994. Since 1 July PTT Telecom has been
     continuing the service which is being funded from the remaining
     PHARE budget. However, this funding runs out very shortly.

     DANTE has been lobbying both PTT Telecom and the EC to the effect
     that termination of the services (at least without a replacement
     being put in place) would be very bad. PTT Telecom has now received
     a letter from the EC which gives them enough reassurance that
     payment will eventually be made from the PHARE 1994 Programme to
     keep the present services going.

     Both the technical and the funding aspects of the longer term

Internet Monthly Report                                      August 1994


     continuation of these services will be taken up again once the
     management contract for the PHARE 1994 Programme of support for
     research networking has been awarded by the EC.

     US CONNECTIVITY ISSUES

     DANTE will locate the US end of its new 8 Mbps link from Amsterdam
     to the US at the Network Access Point (NAP) in New York which is
     set up as a result of the new arrangements which have been put in
     place by NSF. Another consequence of NSF's changes is that the
     trans-(US-)continental broadband network is not available for
     general use. As a consequence, DANTE and other non-US organisations
     will have to make new arrangements with US service providers for
     distribution of their traffic with the US and for transit between
     Europe and Asia/Pacific (see also 'Some impressions from the 30th
     IETF').

     The actual form of the NAP connection still has to be decided on:
     the choice will be either to obtain a direct connection or via a US
     service provider.

     CONNECTION TO KOREA IN PLACE

     A 64 kbps line between Europe and Korea has become operational on
     23 August 1994. The line provides a direct link between KREONet
     (Korea Research Environment Open Network), the Korean national R&D
     network and EuropaNET. DANTE was awarded the contract to organise
     the connection under the EC EKORN project.

     KREONet, one of five government networks in Korea, was launched in
     1988 and connects all the major university, government and
     commercial research institutes. It provides the Korean research
     community with the 'usual' services such as e-mail, file transfer,
     remote login etc. DANTE's partner in setting up the connection has
     been SERI (Systems Engineering Research Institute), the
     organisation that operates, manages and develops KREONet.

     EUROCAIRN ACTVITY TAKES OFF

     Work on the EuroCAIRN Study Report has started. A contract for this
     Project, to specify requirements and options for the setting up of
     a Superhighway for the European research community, was awarded to
     DANTE in May 1994. The Project team consists of DANTE employees
     complemented with a group of external specialists: Robert Cooper
     (UKERNA/SuperJANET), Bernhard Stockman (KTH, Stockholm), Maria
     Pallares and Chris Broomfield. Istvan Tetenyi, from HUNGARNET
     (Hungary) will be joining from October 1994.

     DANTE is organising a meeting with representatives of the national
     networks in November 1994 to present the findings of the
     preliminary report. The final version of the report will be
     delivered in March 1995.

     SOME IMPRESSIONS FROM THE 30TH IETF, TORONTO - MICHAEL BEHRINGER

     As the title of this article suggests, this is not meant to be a
     precise report on the IETF, but rather an informal gathering of a
     few personal impressions.

     The most interesting decision that was to be made at this summer
     IETF 1994 was concerning the next generation of the Internet
     Protocol. Due to the current growth rate of routing tables, and the
     problems of running out of IP address space, the current version of
     the Internet Protocol has to be either updated or completely re-
     designed. Three proposals have been discussed as IP next
     generation, TUBA, CATNIP and SIPP (I won't explain the details
     here). Although it was not clearly stated during the Plenary
     Session, it was obvious that the choice for IPng went to SIPP. The
     "Simple Internet Protocol Plus" is supposed to tackle a whole range
     of problems experienced with the current version 4 of the IP, for
     example security aspects.

     Another important issue that the Internet has to face during the
     coming months is the change in the US infrastructure. The NSFnet
     backbone as it is today will disappear and be replaced by a
     completely new structure, based on Network Access Points (NAPs).
     Four of those neutral interconnection points will be provided and
     are currently being set up. The basic idea behind it is that
     network providers connect to one or more NAPs and peer there with
     other providers. Providers who need transit capacity to remote
     spots of the Internet will have to buy it from other providers.
     Unfortunately this model only looks at US requirements, without
     taking European or other non-US countries' concerns or problems
     into consideration. As there are a lot of unknowns in this new
     model, it was a heavily discussed item during the IETF, in sessions
     as well as off-line.

     Apart from those two major topics there were a lot of issues
     discussed in the numerous working groups. To list all the work that
     was done there would require a lot of paper or storage space. But
     the fact that quite a few people present at the IETF did not get
     out of the hotel more than once or twice during this week probably
     tells enough about the loads of work being done there.

     For more information, like proceedings, information on the Internet
     Society, working groups, etc. see:

     THE SCOUT REPORT:

     A Weekly Summary of Internet Highlights

     Presently the Scout Report has over 7500 subscribers and the HTML
     versions on the InfoGuide are receiving thousands of accesses each
     week.  A new mailing list was created for easier distribution of
     the HTML Scout Report, which is located at scout-report-html.
     Since its formation the new list has accumulated nearly 100
     subscribers.

     The Scout Report is a weekly publication offered to the Internet
     community as a fast, convenient way to stay informed on network
     activities. Its purpose is to combine in one place the highlights
     of new resource announcements and other news which occurred on the
     Internet during the previous week.

     The Scout Report is released every Friday in multiple formats --
     electronic mail, gopher, and WorldWideWeb.  WorldWideWeb versions
     of the Report include links to all listed resources allowing
     instantaneous browsing of items of interest.  Comments and
     contributions to the Scout Report are encouraged and can be sent to

     DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES

     In August, we made a number of changes to our services to improve
     usability.

     For our general telnet interface (the interface you see when you
     log in to our machines as "guest"), we added variable scrolling
     (the user can indicate how many lines are in one "screen" on his or
     her terminal) and improved both the help information and the
     tutorial.  These changes were made in response to customer
     requests.

     We have installed a new version of WAIS (FreeWAIS from CNIDR) and a
     new WAIS client on all our machines.  This system is currently in
     test mode, and can be tried by logging in as "nwais" to our
     servers.  If you have your own WAIS client and would like to try
     our new server, you can connect to our hosts on port 8210 rather
     than the normal WAIS port, 210.

     We have also installed Bunyip's latest version of Archie on one of
     our servers.  This version includes a number of improvements.  The
     most significant addition is that Archie can now search for Gopher
     menu items as well as anonymous FTP file names.  Since it now
     stores information on Gopher menus as well as anonymous FTP
     archives, the new Archie database is substantially larger than the
     old.  For this reason, the new Archie is currently available on
     only one of our servers (ds1.internic.net); additional storage has
     been ordered for the other servers but will not arrive for a while.

     To search Archie for Gopher menu items, Gopher to ds1.internic.net,
     and select "InterNIC Directory and Database Services" (item 4),
     "Search Anonymous FTP Site and Gopher Menu Indices using Archie"
     (item 8), and then "Gopher Index" (item 3). At that point, you
     might want to start with item 8 "Things you should know" and
     continue through item 13 to get an idea of how to use the system.
     If you do not have a Gopher client of your own, you can telnet to
     ds1.internic.net, log in as gopher, and follow the same steps.

     We welcome comments on any of these changes or additions.  Users of
     the general telnet interface are given an opportunity to enter
     comments when they log out.  Electronic mail comments can also be
     sent to our administrators at admin@ds.internic.net.

     A reminder - if you would like to help the Internet community find
     a resource that you offer, send mail to admin@ds.internic.net and
     we will send information about listing your resource in the
     Directory of Directories.

     NETSTATION
     ==========

     Work this month continued to focus on protocol software
     investigation and development.

     The basic focus of the Netstation project is to determine the
     practicality of substituting a network/protocol interface for
     devices in place of the system bus and memory-mapped control
     registers.  Whereas today's devices are typically memory mapped,
     the devices developed here would be network mapped.

     Ths new class of device would communicate with the outside world
     entirely via packets.  A natural model is to communicate withe the
     device via remote procedure calls (RPCs).  The resulting computing
     system with its devices becomes similar to a cluster computer or
     heterogeneous multicomputer.  By implication, netstation devices
     are accessible directly, via the internetwork at large, rather than

     as a slave only, hung off a bus.

     LANai 1.1 Software Development
     ------------------------------

     One of the unanswered questions regarding Netstation development is
     just what type of performance is it realistic to expect from a
     LANai network interface and the end-point application processess
     that produce and consume packets.

     To define the outlines of a practical engineering envelope, the
     LANai code was rewritten to reflect what is thought to be the
     configuration that will be used by applications to achieve high
     performance in both hosts and netstation devices.  The resulting
     LANai/host interface supports multiple simultaneous protocol
     stacks.  This allows a small number of applications to have direct
     access to the network interface via software packages and is
     loosely similar to the application direct channels (ADCs) developed
     by the X-Kernel project at Arizona.

     Typical performance figures for high-speed networks stress maximum
     attained bandwidth.  This is achieved by using large packets, in
     some cases as large as 64K byte/pkt.  Such a maximum bandwidth
     figure is of little use in determining what the engineering
     limitations are for general device control.  A typical RPC packet
     is short, perhaps only 120 bytes long.

     Two important pieces of engineering information are:

     (1) How many RPCs can an application program running in a
         workstation realistically be expected to generate?

     (2) How many RPCs can an interface program running in a
         device realistically be expected to consume?

     To answer those questions sender and receiver application programs
     were written and installed into separate Sun workstations,
     interfaced to the LANai ADCs, and tested.  These figures below were
     measured by the application programs themselves, with three
     protocol stacks in place, so as to fairly represent achievable
     end-to-end application performance.

     Configuration:

        Two Sun SPARCstation-2 workstations, each with a LANai 1.1
        network interface running at 20 MHz, with the LAN
        channel between them operating at 640 Mb/s.




Cooper                                                         [Page 22]

Internet Monthly Report                                      August 1994


     Sending application:    70.0K pkt/sec  @ 120 byte/IP pkt
     Receiving application:  63.5K pkt/sec  @ 120 byte/IP pkt

     Sending application:    29.7K pkt/sec  @ 1500 byte/IP pkt
     Receiving application:  26.5K pkt/sec  @ 1500 byte/IP pkt

     Sending application:    17.6K pkt/sec  @ 3000 byte/IP pkt
     Receiving application:  15.8K pkt/sec  @ 3000 byte/IP pkt

     A LANai running at 20 MHz, using 640 Mb/s channels, can provide a
     host application with a sustained end-to-end performance of 63.5K
     RPC/sec or bandwidth of 360 Mb/s while using an MTU compatible with
     the Ethernet.  These figures can be improved significantly by
     raising the clock rate of the LANai.  The 20 MHz SBus clock rate of
     the SPARCstation-2 platforms used here made that impractical.  We
     expect that when these tests are run in a SPARCstation-20, the
     performance will be substantially higher.

     Higher figures can also be obtained either via use of larger
     packets or by specially crafting the application/network interface.

     Notes

     The LANai chips were clocked at 20 MHz to match the SBus clock.
     Cable transmission latency across the network between SPARstation-2
     hosts was insignificant for the tests reported here.

     Much of the overhead per packet for short packets is LANai program
     execution at the source and destination, which introduces a forced
     latency between packets.  It is of some interest to sketch the
     typical execution costs within the LANai for both transmission and
     reception.

     The typical case LANai interrupt and status condition loop consumes
     22 machine instructions.  This includes checks for clock and
     channel status, send ready, receive complete, and packet overrun
     conditions.

     A send operation consists of a check for at least one pending
     output packet.  If that is true, a check is made to determine if
     the send DMA is available.  If it is, a loop determines which of

     several sources (protocol stacks) has a packet to send if any.
     This loop consumes 12 instructions per stack that is checked.
     Enabling DMA transmission of the packet consumes 9 instructions.

     A receive operation consumes 19 instructions to perform packet
     length and CRC condition checks.  Subsequently, the free buffer
     pool is scanned to determine the next available packet buffer.
     This consumes 10 instructions per buffer check.  Enabling DMA
     packet reception into that buffer requires 11 instructions.  The
     received packet is then demux'ed.  The demux loop requires
     approximately 5 instructions per packet field check to determine
     into which stack the packet should be placed.  Notifying the
     awaiting application consumes the final 10 instructions.

     These counts are complete.  They include the handshaking between
     the host-system and LANai shared data structures.

     RSVP PROJECT
     ------------

     Following the Toronto IETF meeting, ISI concentrated on putting
     together a preliminary source release of RSVP.  This release is
     expected to include the rsvpd daemon and the API.  It will also
     include the RSVP modifications to sd, vat, and nv that were
     produced by MIT, LBL, and PARC, and modifications to the LBL
     tcpdump program to display RSVP messages.  An initial RSVP release
     should be ready early in September.  The traffic control kernels
     from MIT and from Sun are expected to be released separately.

     Prior to the release, ISI did RSVP development work to bring the
     package into line with the specification.  Path and reservation
     teardown messages are now included.  A logical problem with routing
     reservation error messages was found and fixed; the specification
     will require updating in this area.

     Bobby Minnear at MIT supplied a package "tcl-rsvp", which is a set
     of Tcl and C programs to provide an RSVP interface to sd and vat.
     These components were tested with RSVP across DARTnet as well as
     locally within ISI.  He also updated the nv/RSVP interface that Ron
     Frederick at PARC had produced last year.

     John Wroclawsi at MIT produced and started testing a DARTnet kernel
     realizing the CSZ service model.  Some anomalies which were
     observed with this kernel in service have not been tracked down
     yet.

     Ajit Thyagarajan at Xerox PARC included the RSVP kernel changes in
     his new (3.3) release of IP multicasting code.  This will greatly
     aid the introduction of RSVP.  This new code also requires that
     rsvpd obtain multicast routes from mrouted, rather than from the
     kernel, by a process-process query mechanism.  This mechanism must
     be developed and tested next month; it will not be included in the
     initial RSVP release, which will support only pre-3.3 versions of
     IP multicast.

     completion of an agreement to acquire the Bay Area Regional
     Research Network (BARRNet(SM)) from Stanford University in Palo
     Alto, California.  This marks the consolidation of two of the
     country's premier Internet service providers:  BBN's NEARNET(SM)
     operation in the Northeast, and BARRNet, the leading provider of
     such services in the San Francisco Bay Area.  BBN and Stanford had
     previously announced their intention for BBN to acquire BARRNet on
     June 22.

     NYSERNET CONTRACTS WITH NYNEX AND SPRINT TO PROVIDE MOST ADVANCED
     STATE DATA NETWORK IN THE COUNTRY

     Liverpool, NY, September 1 - The New York State Education and
     Research Network - NYSERNet, Inc. - announces agreements with NYNEX
     and Sprint to significantly upgrade NYSERNet's network and
     internetworking services for New York State.  This unique
     arrangement is the first step in NYSERNet's Five-Year Network
     deployment Plan to provide more than a 100-fold increase in the
     information carrying capabilities of the New York Network, At the
     completion of Phase I of the Plan, at the end of 1995, NYSERNet and
     New York State will have the most technologically advanced state
     data network in the country.

     The NYNEX and Sprint agreements will provide a 45 million bit per
     second (T-3) statewide network for NYSERNet affiliates by November
     of 1994.  This will vastly improve routing and service to NYSERNet
     affiliates and deliver T-3 speeds for prices that are less than
     half the current national average.  NYSERNet now operates a 1.5
     million bit per second T-1 network.

     "By working with NYNEX and Sprint, access to the network and
     Internet will eventually be provided throughout the State through a
     local dial-up phone call anywhere," said James Luckett, Executive
     Director and Vice President of NYSERNet.  "This will guarantee that
     there is no have assured and equal access to information resources
     and the other benefits which will accrue from the National
     Information Infrastructure."

     Sprint, a premier provider of advanced technology data services,
     will initially provide a 45 mb high speed state wide area network,
     which will include 45 mb connectivity to the Internet,
     comprehensive management of the new NYSERNet network, and
     management of the NYSERNet affiliates TCP/IP based services onto
     that network and onto the Internet. Sprint will also provide
     communications and routing equipment. This network is expected to
     grow to gigabit speeds quickly in the next few years.

     "NYNEX is proud to be a part of this important partnership," said
     NYNEX State Group Vice President, Duane Albro. "NYSERNet is as
     critical to New York State as Internet is to the country," he
     added.  "In providing the backbone network, NYNEX continues to
     aggressively pursue the expansion of the information superhighway."

Internet Monthly Report                                      August 1994


     The NYSERNet Plan will deliver in New York State the first
     production gigabit communication network in the U.S. It will be
     capable of providing high speed access at all the State's
     institutions of higher education, all of its 6,000 K-12 schools,
     its 7,000 libraries and museums, 500 health care institutions,
     1,500 municipal, county, state and federal agencies, and some
     15,000 commercial users who interact with these sectors.

     NYSERNet's new network will support all traditional Internet
     services as well as such new services as interactive 2-way video
     and teleconferencing and electronic commerce applications. It will
     enable a new generation of inexpensive distance learning,
     telemedicine and community network applications.

     "We anticipate a vast increase in Internet connections in New York
     State by the end of the century, bringing the number of New Yorkers
     with Internet access up to 10 million from the half million today,"
     said Dr.  Richard Mandelbaum, President of NYSERNet. "Our goal is
     to ensure access to the network and high quality service for all
     school children and their families, college students and faculty,
     health care practitioners and patients, and small and minority-
     owned businesses -- cheaply, easily and quickly."

     NYSERNet is the leading regional high-speed data network in the
     U.S.  NYSERNet connects New York State to the global community of
     computing resources known as the Internet.  it serves an affiliate
     base of over 400 organizations such as large research centers,
     hospitals, universities, colleges, public libraries, K-12 schools,
     museums, large corporations and small Business.

     PROJECT GAIN REPORT

     NYSERNet is pleased to announce the availability of a new videotape
     about Project GAIN, which extended Internet access to five rural
     New York State public libraries and one Indian Nation school.

     Project GAIN (Global Access Information Network) asked what would
     happen if rural librarians were given access to the Internet, its
     tools, and training. Could they learn to use networked information
     resources effectively? Was there anything of value on the Net to
     improve the quality of service offered to rural patrons? And what
     resources did the rural areas have to offer back to the larger
     Internet community?

Internet Monthly Report                                      August 1994


     The video documents the project from the first training meetings to
     site visits at all the libraries. The style is perfect for
     workshops introducing the Internet to librarians, or for anyone
     wondering how rural areas might benefit from a community Internet
     connection.

     The printed Project GAIN Report, bundled with the video, outlines
     the lessons learned from connecting; details critical success
     factors contributing to the overall accomplishments of the project;
     and offers a number of recommendations for public librarians,
     network service providers, policy makers, and researchers.
     Appendices include evaluation instruments, contracts, success
     stories, and more.

RARE ISUS Meetings

   The RARE ISUS (Information Services and User Support) Working Group
   met before the INET94/JENC5 Conference in Prague, The Czech Republic.

1) Introductions

   Jill Foster introduced to the attendees the new ISUS WG Chair, David
   Hartland (University of Newcastle upon Tyne).  There was quite a
   large attendance at this meeting, with many new participants.  Jill
   had invited the attendees from ISOC's "Developing Networking
   Countries" Workshop the week before to attend ISUS.  There was
   discussion regarding the ISUS "Introductions" file.  ISUS meeting
   participants were requested to fill in the template about themselves
   and turn it in.

2) Minutes, Workplan, and Task Forces

   Minutes from the last ISUS meeting were reviewed.  Jill asked the
   attendees if anyone had any problems with the minutes of the
   Telematics group.  There were no objections.

   There is on-going work on setting up National ISUS WGs in parallel
   with the European group.  RTR1 (RARE Technical Report 1) is out of
   date and the ISUS needs to take a look at the document and provide
   new ideas and input for the revision.  This includes updating the
   document to include details about coordination of national entry
   points via the Eurogopher effort.

   The RARE ISUS workplan needs to be revised, as it is out of date.  It
   was decided to drop the ISO-SR (Search and Retrieval) program, due to
   no progress or interest.

3) Review of Liaison Groups

   Brief reviews were given by various representatives.  Jill lead the
   reviews with ISUS.  She reported that she had to step down as Chair

Internet Monthly Report                                      August 1994


   of the ISUS Group as she is now employed two days a week with RARE.
   There is a new policy within RARE that if you are paid by RARE, you
   cannot be a RARE WG Chair, as this would pose a conflict of interest.
   Hence, David Hartland has become the new ISUS WG Chair.

   Joyce Reynolds reported on the User Services Area (USV) efforts in
   the IETF.  Before traveling to Prague, she circulated her area report
   to the ISUS WG email list.  Due to time constraints, she gave a brief
   overview of the area.  The User Services Working Group (USWG) is the
   "umbrella" WG for the USV.  This group is the spawning ground for
   most of the working groups which are created within the area.  There
   are currently 11 working groups in the USV area.  Particular groups
   of interest to this audience include: Network Information Services
   Infrastructure (NISI), which is currently producing a NIC Guidelines
   Document, Network Training Materials (a joint RARE and IETF
   endeavor), Internet School Networking (ISN), User Documentation
   (UserDoc2), which is producing a short introductory bibliography of
   books about the Internet, Network Information Retrieval (NIR), a
   joint RARE and IETF endeavor, and Integrated Directory Services
   (IDS), which is a combined effort of the USV and Applications Area of
   the IETF.

   Joyce continued her report by describing the RFC (Request for
   Comments) series of notes of the Internet, and in particular, the FYI
   (For Your Information) subseries of RFCs.  FYIs are introductory and
   overview documents for network users.  Their purpose is to make
   available general information, rather than the protocol
   specifications or standards that is typical of other RFCs.  If there
   were any questions or if anyone wanted further information in more
   detail, Joyce mentioned that she would be happy to answer queries via
   email.

   Daniele Bovio was asked by Jill to report on EARN and EARNINFO, since
   David Sitman had not yet arrived to the meeting.  Daniele briefly
   discussed EARN's Network Services Conference (NSC) which is to be
   held this coming November in London.  Daniele punted the EARNINFO
   report to David to talk about later, when he arrives.

   Geza Turchanyi provided a brief report on RIPE and its Network
   Information Discovery for Users Support Working Group (NIDUS),
   chaired by Nandor Hovarth.  Unfortunately, the NIDUS group has not
   been very active.  The RIPE NCC currently has available Gopher, WWW,
   FTP, and WAIS services.  The WWW server locator is:
   http://www.ripe.net/

   Bert Stals gave a report on the Gopher Conference (Gophercon).  He
   opened his report by providing some Gopher history.  When it first
   started, there was a need for alternative information.  In 1993,

Internet Monthly Report                                      August 1994


   about one third of all Gophers were Gopher+ servers, globally.  A
   Z39.50 gateway is available.  The problems with Veronica are
   increasing.  Most complaints are about the bandwidth.  To date,
   Veronica has 6,900 Gopher servers, with 31 simultaneous sessions of
   Veronica available, with a two second response time.  Veronica is not
   scaling well.  Chris Weider mentioned that indexing of Gopher menu
   items will be in a future release of archie (gopher-
   index@bunyip.com).

   George Munroe reported on the WWW Conference.  Tim Berners-Lee is
   concerned about where WWW is going from where he originally intended
   it to be.  There is a need for better integration on desktop access.
   Tim mentioned that there is a need for a "Bill of Rights for the
   Network."  There needs to be a close relationship prevailing
   everywhere in industry and research.  There should be a consideration
   for social impacts and the need for on-going standardization.

   The RARE Document Store was reported by Tim Dixon.  RARE
   publications, WG documents and other miscellaneous pointers to RARE
   documents can be found on ftp.rare.nl, gopher.rare.nl, and
   www.rare.nl.  Tim suggested that David, Jill, and the ISUS group look
   at the RARE document server to see how to get more information out
   via this service.

Information Services

   Jill provided an introduction to the European Information Services
   which included Dante, the RARE server, the RIPE NCC, Eurogopher, and
   EARN.  There is a Dante proposal out, soliciting a new entry point
   for a Euroserver.  Josefien Bersee put out the proposal one week ago.
   Jill encouraged the ISUS attendees to read it, then introduced
   Josefien who presented a talk on the Dante proposal.

   The proposal reflected ideas on a provision of a Central Information
   Service for the European Research Community.  Dante is a not-for-
   profit entity via twelve countries with national networks.  This
   project used to be CONCISE.  They are investing in another service as
   funding will end this year.  The key requirements to this proposal
   include a collection of distributed information that is up-to-date,
   accurate, and complete as possible.  This will also include round the
   clock availability and support for information management.  The
   proposed information flow model intends to provide links to local
   information.  The use of WWW, Gopher and FTP is included.  The most
   important issue is the management of the information by building a
   management information base.

   Josefien expressed that the Dante proposal is not intending to take
   over other services, but to link with them (e.g., RARE, RIPE,



Cooper                                                         [Page 42]

Internet Monthly Report                                      August 1994


   EARNINFO, etc.).  The promotion of the service is to attract new
   groups to contribute.

   The technical requirements include stable guidance services and
   making accessibility to end users as easy as possible.  There will be
   a Help Desk, and its function will be to perform support and
   information services to end user, new information providers, and
   documentation.  Staff running the Help Desk should speak more than
   one language.  In regards to Dante funding efforts, it should be
   self-supporting.  Funding should come from the customers, national
   networks, the CEC, and commercial providers.  Issues of Quality of
   Information and Quality of Service are big points.

   A lively discussion was held on Dante after Josefien's presentation.
   Comments included that "Quality Assurance" is becoming a very hot
   topic.  Eurogopher was brought up as a project that has already
   completed the efforts that are spelled out in the Dante proposal, and
   all done via volunteer work.  There was a concern with some ISUS
   members that Dante may be taken as opposition to the Eurogopher work,
   though this remains to be seen.  Anders Gillner commented that he
   does not see Dante as a threat.  The Eurogopher acts as one link, so
   there is no problem with other links.  The world will never be just
   one link.  There needs to be a spirit of cooperation and
   coordination.

Networked Information Retrieval (NIR)

   Jill provided a status report on NIR Tools and Groups.  She provided
   a history of this group as it was noted that two thirds of the
   attendees to ISUS at this session were new.  The NIR document has
   been assigned "RTR 13", and is on its way to the RFC Editor.  Note:
   since this meeting, this document has been published as an RFC:

      RFC 1689, RTR 13, FYI 25, "A Status Report on Networked
      Information Retrieval: Tools and Groups", August 1994.

   A discussion focussed on RTR 1.  This document is out of date and is
   over one year old.  Jill's intention in the next two to three months
   is to work on an update to this document.  There is a question about
   the use of Gopher and WWW, as some people don't have access.

   David Sitman arrived at the meeting and Jill asked if he had anything
   new to report about EARNINFO.  David replied he did not.

User Network Interface to Everything (UNITE)

   George Munroe gave a report on the UNITE group.  UNITE's concept is
   one of an interface to everything out on the network.  In October

   1992, this effort was started and driven by Jill.  There is a UNITE
   overview, charter, and summary of activities.  One of the IETF
   groups, Integration of Internet Information Resources (IIIR), has a
   vision paper in development which includes UNITE.  How can UNITE be
   more effective?  Perhaps setting up a web would help.  There is a
   prototype that has been set up, and George would like input on it.
   Jill will put a pointer to the source in the ISUS minutes.  [From the
   26 July minutes filed to the ISUS WG list: (url:
   file://www.qub.ac.uk/UNITE/unite.html).]

   UNITE working with the IETF and other ISUS groups will continue.
   This work is of relevance to each person's own institution, and
   George feels that everyone should convince their employers of this.
   There are three key factors:

      1) Coordination
      2) Cooperation
      3) Consolidation

   George talked about the 4th Framework Initiative and envisioned a
   diagram or map a UNITE interface of how he perceives it today, as an
   "ideal" picture under the 4th Framework.  A system is being designed,
   not just a white pages service.  The UNITE interface needs much more
   definition.  There has been some discussion on the mailing list
   regarding opportunities for funding projects which would help develop
   and progress UNITE's endeavors and other ISUS task forces.  There has
   also been some commercial interest.


NSC Conference Program Committee Meeting, Monday, 6:30 pm

   Joyce Reynolds, as a member of the NSC94 (Network Services
   Conference) Program Committee, met with other committee members
   Monday evening, June 13.  The meeting included discussion on a
   potential keynote speaker, schedules, dates and deadlines for paper
   submissions, demos, and sessions to the conference.  Organization of
   tutorials, tracks and plenary sessions were also discussed.

   5) Panel: Power to the User!  Enabling Users to Help Themselves
      Chair: Rolf Nordhagen, University of Oslo Information
      Technology Services, Norway

   To provide support for the increasing numbers of users on the network
   is a formidable task.  This session will be run as a panel discussion
   with expert panelists from around the world sharing their knowledge
   and experience.  Audience participation is highly encouraged.

   Panelists: Robert F. Janz, University of Groningen, The Netherlands
              David Hartland, NISP/Mailbase, Newcastle University, UK
              Anders Gillner, NORDUnet, The Royal Institute of

User Help Thyself Panel - Rolf Nordhagen, Chair

Panelists:

Joyce K. Reynolds, Information Sciences Institute, USA

   Joyce was asked by Rolf to open the panel session in describing and
   updating the work that is going on in the IETF User Services Area and
   how this entity and the RARE ISUS WG assist in helping users.

   When the IETF was first established, it did not immediately create a
   distinct User Services Area.  As of 1991, this area has grown to take
   its place with other Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) areas
   as the importance of a user services forum has increased globally.

   1) ALL levels of "user" - novice, intermediate, advanced.

   2) People attend the INET/JENC conference to learn.  For example,
      teachers, trainers, and consultants, not only their students must
      learn about networking tools, documentation, and current protocol
      standards.

   3) This last Monday and Tuesday RARE's Information Services
      and User Support (ISUS) Group convened.  Their activities include:

Internet Monthly Report                                      August 1994


      Documentation, Training Materials, User Network to Everything
      (UNITE), Network information Retrieval, etc., to help the user.

   Joyce continued to describe the details of what the User Services
   Area of the IETF entails, including the FYI RFC series of notes.

Robert F. Janz, University of Groningen, The Netherlands

   Robert Janz displayed six bullets on the overhead projector and
   described what he felt was needed for the users to help themselves.
   One should not react after a user is in trouble, but before trouble
   happens.  Yet, what can one do?

      1) Prevent "after sales repair"
      2) Abolish paper documentation
      3) Get into specification phases
      4) Use network technology extensively
      5) NO support of the state of the art technology
      6) Encourage "electronic" work groups

David Hartland, NISP/Mailbase, Newcastle University, UK

   David Hartland responded to Robert's six bullets listed above.  He
   explained that he does not necessarily agree with Richard on all
   points.  There is the project he has been working on at Newcastle,
   which is the Mailbase User Support Project.  It has a very high level
   of support, but it's a small team effort.  David disagreed with
   Robert about he abolishment of paper documentation.  He stated that
   there should still be paper documentation, and his group will
   continue to do so.  There are no plans in the future to get rid of
   it.  "Physiotheraphysics" - still growing by leaps and bounds - needs
   help from the audience.

Anders Gillner, NORDUnet, The Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden

   Anders discussed the issue of tools and the availability of global
   network documentation.  There should be the availability to look at
   documentation from all uses, either via the network or by hardcopy.
   Users are all academics.  They can read well.  Anders agreed on the
   panel's current view, which is to get people to use the network.
   There should be continued motivation to get them to do so.  In order
   to do this there we need to produce better tools.  We use robots to
   extend our muscles, networks should be able to help user's with
   shortcomings.







Cooper                                                         [Page 47]

Internet Monthly Report                                      August 1994


   The term, "selective perception scanning" was discussed by Anders.
   He felt that selective perception scanning cannot be done in the
   information network.  There needs to be some sensitizing.  There is a
   need for cyberspace and virtual worlds, but also habituation and
   selective perception.  Self clustering documents are needed as well
   as programs for analyzing reasoning.  First, one has to get rid of
   the litter and tag the information.  None of the network tools
   currently have this.

Rolf Nordhagen - Opened discussion to audience participation.

   One member of the audience had a disagreement with no paper copies or
   virtual copies of documents.  He said think about the values of
   paper.  There is even legislation in the UK on how long a person
   should be sitting in front of the PC.  Another participant felt that
   paper documentation is not searchable and indexing confusing.  There
   are efforts to provide one page descriptions as a starter, but no
   bigger, and short and to the point.

   There was also discussion regarding Anders' thoughts on habituation.
   Habituation may not necessarily be textual.  It should be built into
   the program.  A book was cited by Edward Tufte on "Envisioning
   Information".  He is a professor at MIT.  The book describes
   presenting information and visualizing information.  It was suggested
   that the panelist and audience read this work.

   Another audience participant agreed regarding the progression and
   dissemination of information.  SGML, HTML are not page layout.  Not
   scrolling paradimes.  Everyone needs help, put a lot back into it,
   but also one need to put a lot back into it, too.  There also needs
   to be a change of user support of the tools that are being developed.
   There are Internationalization issues.  In many cases, English and
   computers are not users "first" languages.  There are wonderful
   resources out there.  Perhaps putting out single sheet A4 cards would
   be a first start.  Then, get the URLs together to access information.
   The Interpedia project was mentioned, which will turn the Internet
   into a global "encyclopedia".

   User groups have magnificent tools available, yet how do you make
   sure that this information is spread to all the Universities and all
   over the world?  Some of these tools are totally illegible to the end
   user.  Electronic mailing lists and mailing list groups are valuable.
   There needs to be a separation of the context and community which
   goes beyond the technical development.

   In the last part of the session, the audience discussed how to access
   training material, and what material is available.  Margaret Issacs
   is a person to talk to about training materials.  It was pointed out



Cooper                                                         [Page 48]

Internet Monthly Report                                      August 1994


   that her materials are "just" in English, and not in other languages.
   There is a need to find out what other training materials are
   available in one's native language.

Network Information: Tools and Access - Chair: David Sitman, EARN,
France

Wild Beasts and Unapproachable Bogs - Chris Weider, USA

   In many aspects, the Internet is still in the Bronze Age.  We know
   it's here, somewhere.  Surveying tools:

   1)  Send it everywhere tools (email, usenet news).
       Send it everywhere tools have a hidden assumptions of immediate
       consumption.

   2)  Come and get it tools (used by most of the tools).
       Allows the information provider the video communications
       and is the closest to sent it everywhere.

   What are the implications?  The "send it everywhere tools" provide
   human to human communication.  The "come and get it tools" allow
   extensive logging, but means extra space and resources on the host
   machine.

   Balance and Symmetry

      There is no way to access data across a small pipe, because of
      bandwidth problems.  Chris encouraged the session attendees to
      think about cooperative local cache.  The technology to do this is
      probably a year off.  Is accessible to a big resource a right or a
      privilege?

   Building the Maps - Signposts and Markers

      There is a lot of building going on in the Internet Engineering
      Task Force (IETF) in working groups that are defining and
      specifying, URLs (Universal Resource Locators), URNs (Universal
      Resource Names), a set of coordinates, and URCs (Universal
      Resource Characters) a consistent set of descriptions.

   Supporting Diversity - Tying it all Together

      Chris feels that there are unapproachable bogs out there in which
      new tools are required.  All tools are all essentially the same as
      are the visual tools for navigation.  Revolution is needed.  Each
      user needs her own maps, not just following the information
      providers' concept of how resources are arranged and related.



Cooper                                                         [Page 49]

Internet Monthly Report                                      August 1994


      URNs and URLs should support this, but this is not the whole
      solution.

   Navigation - What's That?

      There is a need for richer metainformation.  Many users can't
      play, as they don't' have bandwidth to do that.  Active Agents
      (Chris akined them to Armstrong or Cortez?).  There is a need for
      them, but we must be careful.

   Conclusions

      We are starting to map the net.  It will be a long process.  We
      need to make sure that everyone can organize the resources of the
      net to their liking.  Looking forward to: 2001 - The Internet
      Odyssey.
