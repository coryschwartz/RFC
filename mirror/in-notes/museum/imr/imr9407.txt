INTERNET ENGINEERING REPORTS
----------------------------

     1. The 30th meeting of the IETF was held in Toronto, Ontario,
        Canada from July 25 through July 29, 1994. The meeting was
        hosted by The University of Toronto. Though not yet final,
        there were over 700 attendees.

        The next IETF meeting will be in San Jose, California from
        December 5-9, 1994. Following that, the IETF will be meeting in
        Danvers (a suburb of Boston) from April 3-7, 1995. We currently
        working on the summer IETF meeting to be held in Stockholm,
        Sweden. Once all the arrangements have been made, notifications
        will be sent to the IETF Announcement list. Remember that
        information on future IETF meetings can be always be found in
        the file 0mtg-sites.txt which is located on the IETF shadow
        directories.

     2. The IETF Secretariat has joined the Web! The URL for the IETF
        Home Page is "http://www.ietf.cnri.reston.va.us/home.html" and
        contains information on IETF Working Groups, Internet-Drafts,
        RFCs, etc. The proceedings from the Seattle IETF meeting (March,
        1994) are on the Web as well.


     3. The IESG approved or recommended the following four Protocol
        Actions during the month of July, 1994:

        o  Definitions of Managed Objects for SMDS Interface is a Draft
           Standard.

        o  Definitions of Managed Objects for ATM Management Version
           8.0 is a Proposed Standard.

        o  RDBMS-MIB is a Proposed Standard.

        o  Modem MIB is a Proposed Standard.


     4. The IESG issued one Last Call to the IETF during the month of
        July, 1994:

        o  Post Office Protocol - Version 3 <draft-rose-pop3-again-03>
           for consideration as a Draft Standard.

INTERNET PROJECTS

ANSNET/NSFNET BACKBONE ENGINEERING
----------------------------------

     Network Status Summary
     =======================

     ANSnet total packet traffic increased by about 1.75% in July'94. An
     increase in the ANSnet forwarding table size of .35% was observed
     during the month of July.

     April Backbone Traffic Statistics
     ==============================

     The total inbound packet count for the ANSnet (measured using SNMP
     interface counters) was 62,709,811,154 on T3 ENSS interfaces, up
     1.5% from June.  The total packet count into the network including
     all ENSS serial interfaces was 71,692,393,856 up 1.74% from June.

     Router Forwarding Table Statistics
     ================================

     The maximum number of destinations announced to the ANSnet during
     July was 17,853 up .35% from June.

     The number of network destinations configured for announcement to
     the ANSnet but never announced (silent nets) during July was
     15,894.

     BGP-4/CIDR Deployment Status
     ============================

     No new autonomous systems began exchanging routing information with
     ANSnet via the BGP-4 protocol during June.

     As of August 9th '94, we have observed the withdrawal of 6,732
     class based destinations from the ANSnet router forwarding tables
     that are now represented by 1,157 configured aggregates.  Among
     these configured aggregates:

        1,026 of these are top-level aggregates (not nested in another
        aggregate).

        818 of these are actively announced to ANSnet.

        683 of these have at least one subnet configured (the other 135
        may be saving the Internet future subnet announcements).

Internet Monthly Report                                        July 1994


        596 of these have resulted in the withdrawal of at least one
        configured more specific route.

        583 of these have resulted in the withdrawal of 50% of their
        configured more specific routes.

        570 of these have resulted in the withdrawal of most (80%+) of
        their more specific routes.

     For up-to-date information is available from merit.edu:
     pub/nsfnet/cidr/cidr-savings.

     For further details on these CIDR aggregates, see
     merit.edu:pub/nsfnet/cidr/nestings.announced for full listings.


     Routing Stability Measured on the T3 Network
     ============================================

     Internal routing stability measurements are made by monitoring
     short term disconnect times (disconnects of five minutes duration
     or less).  This is intended as a measure of overall system
     stability rather than complete connectivity.  Some instability was
     experienced in July mostly due to router restarts required to
     accomplish installation of a new AIX build and problems with gated
     during reconfiguration.  There were also some equipment problems
     that caused instability for E222 and E163.

BOLT BERANEK AND NEWMAN INC.
----------------------------

     Current BBN projects include:

     "Nimrod," an architecture for next-generation internet routing and
     addressing.  This month, work continued on defining the functions
     and protocols needed to enable interaction among the various Nimrod
     components, including entity representatives, association agents,
     root agents and forwarding agents.  Results of this work were
     presented at the Toronto IETF meeting.

     Point of contact: Martha Steenstrup, msteenstrup@bbn.com

     Enhancements to Inter-Domain Policy Routing.  During July, work
     progressed on implementation of a parser for handling the new
     syntax and grammar for the IDPR configuration file.  Various
     improvements have been designed to make IDPR configuration easier
     to understand and less painful.  For example, definition of an
     adjacent policy gateway and its connections used to involve
     multiple configuration statements that have now been consolidated
     into one.  Specification of source policies used to require per-
     flow definitions, and now, one can state a policy and then list all
     the flows to which it applies.  There are several similar
     improvements that should lead to greater flexibility and reduced
     verbosity.

     Point of contact: Martha Steenstrup, msteenstrup@bbn.com

     Determination of token bucket parameters necessary to meet service
     requirements of some observed TCP flows.  Results could be used,
     for example, to guide the future configuration of traffic-shaping
     network interfaces.

     Point of contact: Craig Partridge, craig@bbn.com

     Enhancing the Flow Synchronization Protocol.  Under Arpa funding,
     BBN developed a protocol for synchronization of multiple flows
     across an internetwork.  A common application for this protocol is
     lip-sync: synchronization of voice and video flows in a
     videoconferencing application over wide area networks.  The
     protocol does not require the flows' sources or their destinations
     to share common hardware.  It relies on network clock
     synchronization protocols (e.g. NTP) to provide time



Cooper                                                         [Page 12]

Internet Monthly Report                                        July 1994


     synchronization, and it adaptively equalizes the flows' delays
     through the networks to a common end-to-end delay.  The adaptation
     employed allows interactive applications to reach the most
     desirable compromise between degree of synchronization and
     resultant end-to-end delay.  Experiments to date have demonstrated
     lip-synchronization and synchronization of a widely dispersed
     musical ensemble.  A description of the protocol and these
     experiments can be found in the February 1994 issue of the IEEE/ACM
     Transactions on Networking (Flow Synchronization Protocol, by
     Escobar, Partridge, and Deutsch).  This month, work continued on
     testing the new GUI-based configuration tool in preparation for a
     demonstration to be presented at ACM MultiMedia '94.  In addition,
     a library of Sync. Protocol code and documentation for implementors
     was made available via anonymous ftp.

     THE InterNIC INFOGUIDE

     Usage of the InterNIC InfoGuide has been growing weekly since its
     debut.  It is now consistently getting over 20,000 accesses per week.
     The net- happings index (which is updated daily) and the Scout Report
     are among its most popular items.  A new area was added to the IETF
     User Services Working Group.

     The InterNIC InfoGuide is a comprehensive online information service
     which provides information about the Internet and online Internet
     resources. Accessible through gopher and the WorldWideWeb, the
     InterNIC InfoGuide replaces the older InterNIC information server, the
     InfoSource. The InfoGuide includes new services such as the Scout
     Report and an online hypertext version of the _NSF Network News_.

     To access the InterNIC InfoGuide, point your WorldWideWeb client to:

     THE SCOUT REPORT: A Weekly Summary of Internet Highlights

     Presently the Scout Report has over 7500 subscribers and the HTML
     versions on the InfoGuide are receiving thousands of accesses each
     week.  A new mailing list was created for easier distribution of
     the HTML Scout Report, which is located at scout-report-html.
     Since its formation the new list has accumulated nearly 100
     subscribers.

     The Scout Report is a weekly publication offered to the Internet
     community as a fast, convenient way to stay informed on network
     activities. Its purpose is to combine in one place the highlights
     of new resource announcements and other news which occurred on the
     Internet during the previous week.

     The Scout Report is released every Friday in multiple formats --
     electronic mail, gopher, and WorldWideWeb.  WorldWideWeb versions
     of the Report include links to all listed resources allowing
     instantaneous browsing of items of interest.  Comments and
     contributions to the Scout Report are encouraged and can be sent to
     scout@internic.net.

     How to Get the Scout Report

     To receive the electronic mail version of the Scout Report each
     Friday, join the scout-report mailing list. This mailing list will

     ----------

     Work this month continued to focus on protocol software
     investigation and development.

     Display Server Investigation
     ----------------------------

     A graduate student, S. K. Munnangi, has split the X-display server
     into two parts.  The "lower" server portion will reside on the
     network display peripheral being constructed.  Packets will be sent
     between the "higher" portion of the server to the display
     peripheral to determine how practical it may be to replace the
     system bus with a gigabit LAN.

     The higher and lower portions will be prototyped and debugged on
     two Sun workstations prior to porting the lower portion to the
     display peripheral.  A TMS 320C40 emulator and simulator is being
     used for porting and testing prior to actual display hardware
     arrival.

     LANai 1.1 Software Development
     ------------------------------

     The focus of LANai development during the past month has been on
     debugging and testing of a sequenced reliable-packet protocol
     implemented "inside" the ATOMIC LAN.  This allows an application to
     treat the LAN as a reliable medium, much as it would now treat a
     DMA transmission between the CPU and a device across a system bus.

     The work done by the LANai networking chips to achieve this is
     straightforward.

        SEND,RECV: connection maintenance
        SEND,RECV: transmission and reception interrupt service
        SEND:      sequence number generation and insertion in packets



Cooper                                                         [Page 18]

Internet Monthly Report                                        July 1994


        SEND:      retransmission event creation
        SEND,RECV: bad packet, duplicate and out-of-sequence detection
        RECV:      ACK generation and transmission
        SEND:      ACK reception and processing
        RECV:      retranmission event removal

     Currently, only one outstanding packet per connection is allowed.
     The performance figure per packet is 125.5 microseconds.  This
     includes all "normal" work performed listed above.  It is measured
     from the time that the sending LANai notices that a packet should
     be sent, until it has sent it, spawned a retransmission event,
     processed the returned ACK, removed the retransmission event, and
     marked the sending application's buffer as sent.

     Testing Notes
     -------------

     The LANai chips were clocked at 20 MHz to match the SBus clock.
     Short IP/UDP/RPC packets of approximately 120 octets were used
     during these tests.  Cable transmission time across the ATOMIC
     network between SPARstation-2 hosts was insignificant.  The LANai
     channel transmission clock was 60 MB/s.  Total one-way transmission
     latency should therefore be under three microseconds.

     The bulk of the 125 microseconds of overhead per packet for short
     packets is LANai program execution at the source and destination,
     which introduces a forced latency between packets.  For example,
     call-out queue event insertion and event removal for the
     retransmission time-out consumes 30 microseconds.

     The current prototype LANai 1.1 chips can be clocked 50% faster, to
     30MHz, but that was not be done due to the difficulties of
     interfacing to a 20 MHz SBus.

     More testing and development will occur during August.  The one-
     outstanding-packet restriction will be relaxed to see what
     improvement, if any, will be realized.

     THE US DOMAIN
     =============

     Under the current ruling, only 4 year universities are allowed to
     register in EDU, all other US schools must register in the US
     Domain, including K12, community colleges, and technical schools.
     Other related school entities may also register in the US Domain.

     The US Domain has a framework established for registering K12
     schools.  It is in the form:

             <school-name>.<district>.K12.<state-code>.US

             For example:  Clinton-HS.ACSD.K12.TN.US

     School related Entities that go under K12:
     ------------------------------------------

             -  school districts
             -  school boards
             -  special educational service units
             -  state departments of education
             -  city and county departments of education
             -  consortiums connecting school districts
             -  state agencies connecting K12 schools
             -  School networks providing connectivity to
                schools and school districts
             -  private schools under PVT pseudo district

     MULTIMEDIA CONFERENCING

     At the IETF meeting held in Toronto this month, there were several
     sessions relevant to multimedia teleconferencing, in particular
     those of the Multiparty Multimedia Session Control (MMUSIC) Working
     Group and the Audio/Video Transport (AVT) Working Group.  The
     MMUSIC session focused on reports from implementors of a range of
     multimedia conferencing applications with the goal of identifying
     common ground for interoperability of both session managers and
     media agents.  As a result, there was commitment by several
     implementors to document their protocol choices, and to prototype
     experiments on interoperation in the near term.

     In the first AVT session, rough consensus was given to submit the
     revised Real-time Transport Protocol specification for Area
     Directorate review and IESG Last Call as a Proposed Standard.  This
     revision, denoted RTP version 2, incorporates changes requested by
     the first AD review in November 1993.  It is the refinement by
     Steve Casner, Ron Frederick, Van Jacobson and Henning Schulzrinne
     of the rough protocol changes presented and discussed at the March
     1994 IETF meeting in Seattle.  This version of the spec was posted
     before the meeting as Internet Draft draft-ietf-avt-rtp-05.txt.

     An overview of the revised RTP was presented in the first AVT
     session, and the group concurred with the choices made on all of
     the previously open issues.  It was agreed that the extension hooks
     provided were adequate for planned experiments with mechanisms not
     included in the current protocol.  A few explanatory sections of
     the draft need to be completed, then it will be submitted.  In the
     second AVT session, video encoding specifications for H.261, JPEG
     and MPEG were presented.  These specifications will also be
     completed as Internet Drafts and then submitted as Proposed
     Standards.

MERIT/NSFNET ENGINEERING
------------------------

     This report summarizes recent activities of Merit's NSFNET Project
     Internet Engineering and Network Management groups.

     Merit's work with midlevel networks has resulted in the increasing
     use of CIDR route aggregation. During July the NSF/ANSNET routing
     tables increased by 62 while 784 specific routes were withdrawn in
     favor of their CIDR aggregate announcement.

     Joint development work continues with RIPE on the RIPE-81++ syntax



Cooper                                                         [Page 26]

Internet Monthly Report                                        July 1994


     and documentation. The current draft is available as:

             ftp.ripe.net:ripe/drafts/ripe-81++.ps

     Merit initially ported the RIPE code and has implemented some of
     the extensions of RIPE-81++. We are in the process of designing a
     transition from the PRDB to the RRDB which will include generation
     of the NSFNET Backbone Router configurations from the RRDB.
     Prototype gateD configuration file generators have been written for
     the RRDB database. This work is seen as a predecessor for the
     generation of configuration files for the Route Server.

     Merit staff collaborated in the University of Michigan project to
     re-establish a UM Network Operations Center. David Morse,
     davmorse@noc.ns.itd.umich.edu, is the NOC manager. The University
     of Michigan NOC will provide first level operational support for
     the Routing Arbiter project.

     Work continues in anticipation of the startup of the first Network
     Access Points (NAPs) and the transition from the current backbone
     service to the new architecture. On line information about the
     transition plan and NAPS is available via a world wide web server
     as: http://rrdb.merit.edu/home.html and via anonymous ftp in the
     /pub/transition directory on the same host.

     Several staff led sessions at the 30th IETF, July 25-29 in Toronto.
     Jessica Yu (with Vince Fuller of BARRNET) led the session of the
     CIDR Deployment Working Group (cidrd). Sue Hares hosted a workshop
     for new working group Chairpersons and presented in the SDRP and
     NetStat working group meetings. Elise Gerich participated in the
     IAB open meeting. Several staff participated in the ATM-NAP
     Workshop for the NSF new architecture awardees which also included
     several Network Service Providers.

     Teen Health Issues Network

     The Teen Health Issues Network of Greater Rochester NY has
     completed its first pilot year.  This network seeks to
     electronically connect the health care givers, school nurses and
     counselors, and health teachers who deal with teens in areas of
     physical, mental and social health.  The Rochester area has a fiber
     optics telecommunications network that carries simultaneous audio
     and video transmission among 8 sites (2 higher education
     institutions and 6 high schools).  Live interactive programs geared
     for the adults were given for professional development in areas
     such as Cults and Their Relationship to Alcohol and Drug Abuse,
     Media Literacy and Conflict Resolution.  The topics of AIDS and
     Teen Pregnancy were addressed in 3 sessions for students which
     provided an opportunity to discuss these timely issues openly with
     HIV+ patients and pregnant/parenting teens, respectively.
     Electronic discussion groups using Internet connections were formed
     after each live event to allow ongoing interaction with other
     participants, and the panelists, in an anonymous fashion.

     The next school year will kick-off the Teen Health Issues Network
     programming with a professional development discussion of the
     Center for Disease Control's Survey of Youth Risks done in Monroe
     County.  The first student event will be on Athletic Induced Asthma
     for athletes and their coaches. The continuing effort to
     electronically connect, equip, and train new users on the Internet
     from all sorts of professional teen healthcare settings will be a
     primary focus in the second pilot year of this network.

     A RARE UPDATE                           no. 12, July 1994
                                         (Double Summer issue)

     COA Information

     RARE members gathered in Darmstadt, courtesy of ESOC, on 19 and 20
     May 1994. Meetings included a joint meeting with the EARN Board of
     Directors dedicated to the proposed merger between RARE and EARN and
     subsequently the 29th CoA meeting.

     The joint meeting was perceived as very constructive. The Executive
     Committees of both organizations had provided the members with draft
     Statutes, Rules and Regulations, a Charter, a Technical Structure and
     a budget, encompassing proposals for membership fees and voting
     rights. The conclusion of the meeting was that the merger was
     feasible and should take place still during 1994 and this event is
     scheduled to take place at the event of the next (and last) RARE
     Council of Administration meeting on 20 October 1994, in Amsterdam.

     A call for a new name for the merged organization has been issued and
     several proposals are under investigation.

     During the CoA meeting, the RARE accounts were - as is traditional
     in May - presented and 1993 financial year was closed with the
     approval of the Council of Administration of the accounts 1993.
     Two networking organizations were unanimously accepted as RARE Full
     National Members: UNICOM-B from Bulgaria and UNIBEL from the Republic
     Belarus.

     The CoA has asked the Executive Committee to reorganize the RIPE
     NCC's management structure by the creation of a management body that
     is representative of the whole customer base in order to enhance
     cooperation with the RIPE NCC's commercial customers. This management
     body will be involved in the fund raising for the RIPE NCC.


     RARE Technical Programme

     The most recent main event for the RARE Technical Programme was
     the INET'94/JENC5 conference, organized by RARE and the Internet
     Society (ISOC), which took place in Prague in mid-June.
     All the RARE Working Groups took the opportunity to
     meet at the conference and were able to present their work to
     visitors from across the whole world.

Internet Monthly Report                                        July 1994


     The Working Group on network operations (WG-NOP) was relaunched
     under its new convenor, Manfred Bogen. The new convenors of
     the Working Group on Information Services and User Support
     (WG-ISUS), Dave Hartland, and the Working Group on Network
     Security (WG-SEC), R=FCdiger Grimm, were able to introduce
     themselves in person.

     Also at the conference, the final stages of two RARE projects
     were reported. The task force on Computer Emergency Response
     Teams has presented plans for a European coordination centre
     for liaison between the front-line support organizations dealing
     with network security incidents. This is now being developed
     into a business plan (which will be the subject of a call for
     tender) for approval by the CoA on 20 October 1994.
     The project of the Working Group on Character Sets, which is
     developing software for conversion between a wide variety of
     coded character sets, was presented at the conference in the
     form of a live demonstration of the conversion program.

     Two new RARE Technical Reports are in the course of production.
     RTR12 on Writing O/R Names is a revision of the guidelines of
     the Working Group on Mail and Messaging (WG-MSG) which takes
     into account recent international standards in this area. RTR13
     is a Status Report on Network Information Retrieval, a
     regularly-updated report which gives an overview of the "state
     of the art" in this field.

     RTR8, 9, 10 and 11 are currently available in printed form
     and can be ordered from the RARE Secretariat.


     RARE has recently entered into contracts with INRIA to work on
     the integration of directory-service access with the World Wide
     Web. RARE is also contributing to the support and development of
     the World Wibe Web project which is seen as a key element in the
     development of information services for researchers.

     Looking to the future, RARE has launched its UPTURN (Umbrella
     Proposal for Telematics for Users and Research Networks)
     initiative to encourage participation in the European Union's
     fourth Framework Programme. The Fourth Framework offers the
     possibility of European funding to assist in collaborative
     projects between commerce and researchers which will result in
     the delivery of telematic services which add to the productivity
     of industrial and academic researchers. RARE is providing
     information on the programme and is assisting in the information
     exchange between potential participants via its UPTURN mailing
     list. To join this list, send electronic mail to

     Conferences and Seminars

     INET'94/JENC5

     RARE's annual Joint European Networking Conference (JENC5) was
     held this year in Prague (Czech Republic), in conjunction with
     the Internet Society's (ISOC) annual INET conference. In every
     respect it was considered a great success. The participants
     numbered around 1200 and came from over a 100 different countries.

     The Czech Technical University and the Czech Educational and
     Scientific NETwork (CESNET) were responsible for the local
     arrangements. They furnished the terminal room with over
     70 workstations, terminals and desktop computers with worldwide
     Internet connectivity. The technical staff also supported the
     connectivity in the demonstration area, where up to 12 highly
     advanced networking applications were presented to the public
     at large. With the support of various sponsors leased lines
     with a total capacity of 2.5 Mbit/s connected the conference
     centre to the rest of the world. This connectivity allowed
     interactive Mbone broadcasts of the plenary sessions of the
     conference to hundreds of sites in many countries.

     That the conference was a truly global event also became apparent
     in the more than 100 presentations and panel discussions in six
     different topical areas: user support and training, distributed
     applications, policy issues, regional issues, network engineering and

Internet Monthly Report                                        July 1994


     network technology. The programme presented the developments in
     technology on ATM, Multimedia, IPng, Routing and Addressing, Network
     Information Tools, Broadband Technology, Performance Analysis,
     Electronic Documentation, Networked Simulation and Virtual Reality
     and Future Generations of Internet Technology, to mention only a
     few of the subjects covered.

     These new technological developments, and the exponential growth of
     networking in the last few years are bringing past side issues to the
     foreground. Policy issues are becoming more and more important
     with the increasing number of active Internet users and its broader
     scale. Also new user communities are emerging every day, and each of
     them has their own specific demands with regard to service, support
     and training. The conference proved a good discussion platform for
     all of these important issues.

     A full set of proceedings was distributed at the conference and a
     number of selected papers of high quality are being prepared for
     publication in a special issue of Computer Networks and ISDN Systems.

     Preceding the conference there was a one day tutorial on ATM
     (Asynchronous Transfer Mode), organized and sponsored by Digital
     Equipment Corporation (DEC).

     The week prior to the conference the workshop for Technologically
     Emerging Countries took place at the Czech Technical University.
     A selected number of participants (approx. 170) from around
     80 countries had the unique opportunity to learn how to access and
     use worldwide Internet resources, as well as build and manage
     national networks in their own countries. The Soros Foundations
     funded participation of many Eastern European and CIS attendees.
     RARE, with the financial support of NATO, took direct responsibility
     for the Network Navigation and Services Track.

     JENC6

     With the Prague event still fresh in memory, preparations have
     already been made for next year's conference that will take place in
     the new Dan Panorama Convention Center in Tel Aviv, Israel from 15-18
     May. The Programme Committee, under the leadership of Jose Barabera
     (FUNDESCO, Spain), has already prepared a Call for Papers that is
     available from jenc6-sec@rare.nl.

     The conference theme, "Bringing the World to the Desktop", may be
     looked upon as a metaphor for two major changes under way:
     - the increasing penetration of daily research/educational work and
     practices by networks and networking technology;
     - the new set of requirements that desktop networking implies for the

Internet Monthly Report                                        July 1994


     underlying technology and the structures of service provision.

     The goal of this conference is to survey the current situation in
     networking, to illuminate major unresolved issues and technologies,
     but most of all to stimulate discussion on possible future
     directions.

     The local arrangements are taken care of by ILAN.

----

     Tony Ballardie, Peter Kirstein, and Ian Wakeman attended the
     Toronto IETF. Ballardie ran the WG on Multicast, Kirstein attended
     many meetings and Wakeman gave presentations on the UCL work on
     Class Based Queueing and on the Conference Control Channel
     Protocol.

     En route to Toronto, Wakeman had stopped off at SURA, where with
     much help from ARPA, and from Erik Sherk and Jennifer Blake-Hedges,
     we were able to get the Class Based Queueing code (& Solaris, and
     an FDDI card and 2nd Ether card and gated) installed one day. We
     will be coordinating with BBN and ULCC to get the routes changed to
     load this up with the UK-US traffic to test the resource allocation
     and link share code over the next month.

     Meanwhile, the CCCP implementation has passed alpha stage, and is
     being used to develop a simple floor control protocol, by
     Crowcroft.
