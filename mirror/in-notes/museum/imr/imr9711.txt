INTERNET MONTHLY REPORTS
------------------------

The purpose of these reports is to communicate to the Internet Research
Group the accomplishments, milestones reached, or problems discovered by
the participating organizations.

Each organization is expected to submit a 1/2 page report on the first
business day of the month describing the previous month's activities.
These reports should be submitted via network mail to "IMR-ED@ISI.EDU".

`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

The Internet Monthly Report mailing list is now managed by MajorDomo at
ISI.EDU.  The announcements of new issues on the Internet Monthly Report
are sent to the IETF-Announce list and to this IMR list.  Requests to be
ADDED or DELETED from the Internet Monthly report list should be sent to
"majordomo@isi.edu" with the message body either "subscribe imr" or
"unsubscribe imr".

Details on obtaining the current IMR, or back issues, via FTP or EMAIL
may be obtained by sending an EMAIL message to "rfc-info@ISI.EDU" with
the message body "help: ways_to_get_imrs".  For example:

         To: rfc-info@ISI.EDU

     INTERNIC DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES

     The Netfind seed database for November contained 2.3 million
     entries.

     A point release of Netfind (5.1.1) is now available.  It fixes some
     bugs that were found by users in Europe.

     The parallel version of Nomenclator was received from Lucent
     Technologies and has been modified to run in a Sun/Solaris
     environment.  It is currently in test.

     The NSF Cooperative Agreement for InterNIC Directory and Database
     Services will expire at the end of March 1998.  We are working with
     other organizations to find new homes for many of the repositories
     that we operate.

     A reminder - if you would like to help the Internet community find
     a resource that you offer, send mail to admin@ds.internic.net and
     we will send information about listing your resource in the
     Directory of Directories.  If you prefer, you can enter information
     about your resource in our WWW suggestion form.  The form can be
     reached through our Directory of Directories Web page at:

THE US DOMAIN REGISTRY

     The US Domain registration form is now available online at
     http://www.isi.edu/us-domain.

     The US Domain has the maps of all the delegated special domains
     online at http://www.isi.edu/us-domain.

     Some of the processing of the requests to the third level domain
     name is now automated. In particular, most requests to register
     names in localities already delegated are automatically forwarded
     to the administrator of that locality.

     Recent announcements:

     1. A new policy has been added to avoid several cases of
     misleading, erroneous, and outright false information provided on
     registration applications.

     One situation that occurs is that one individual represents himself
     as several distinct companies in order to bypass some limitations
     on the number of delegations allowed (e.g., the 50/500 rule).

     Another situation is that with the requirement to provide a
     government employee as the administrative contact for a locality
     delegation.  Some applications have been received with a government
     employee's contact information but that person has no idea that
     such an application has been submitted.  Some applications provide
     contact information for an individual that knows what is going on
     but is not an employee of the locality government.  Still other
     applications have been received where the administrative contact
     information is fictional.

     The US Domain Administration may choose to verify any or all of the
     information on registration applications (including the
     administrative contact) and if it is determined that the an
     application contains false of substantially misleading information
     that application may be denied, or if already acted on the
     delegation may be revoked, and in either case all other delegations
     made to the party submitting the false or misleading application
     may also be revoked.






Ramos                                                          [Page 24]

Internet Monthly Report                                    November 1997


     2. A total of about 2000 locality domains that were delegated to
     several domain name managers have been returned to the US Domain
     administrator.  These localities will be made available for
     redelegation in the coming months.

     3. For delegations made after 1-Jul-97, it is assumed by the US
     Domain Administrator that every applicant for the delegation (or
     redelegation) of a locality name has the written agreement of the
     legitimate government for that locality for the applicant to manage
     the domain name of that locality.

     Evidience of such an agreement does not need to be presented at the
     time of delegation (except that the administrative contact on the
     application template must be the government representative).
     However, if the delegation is later challenged or contested, the
     manager of the locality domain must produce the agreement.  Failure
     to do so will most likely result in the transfer of the management
     of the locality domain to another manager that does have such an
     agreement.

     If there is a dispute as to what is the legitimate government for a
     locality is and who may act for it, the league of cities or
     association of municipalities that each state (as recognized by the
     National League of Cities) may be asked to assist in resolving such
     disputes.

     In some places there are overlapping jurisdictions with the same
     name (for example, the city of Los Angeles and the county of Los
     Angeles).  In such cases, the higher level government should have
     priority.  A new policy has been added regarding the charges for
     the domain name passed on during delegation.  The administrator of
     the locality has to notify one year in advance before charging for
     those domains.

     4. The US Domain administrator no longer makes direct registrations
     of hosts, and only makes delegations of third or fourth level
     domain names (such as localities).

MERIT INTERNET ENGINEERING
--------------------------

     This report summarizes November 1997 activities of Merit's Internet
     Engineering group on behalf of the Routing Arbiter (RA) service and
     other projects.






Ramos                                                          [Page 27]

Internet Monthly Report                                    November 1997


     Jake Khuon is folding the powerful Route Server Daemon (RSd) code
     back into GateD, which is now handled by the Merit GateD Consortium
     (http://www.gated.org).  RSd, which is derived from GateD, was
     developed as part of the NSF-funded Routing Arbiter project by
     Ramesh Govindan of the USC Information Sciences Institute.
     Designed for the Route Servers at the Network Access Points, RSd
     makes it possible to offload computationally intensive routing
     tasks from exchange point peer routers, freeing processing time and
     providing a boost in throughput for each peer system.  The Route
     Servers now operate as part of Merit's Route Server Next Generation
     project (http://www.rsng.net).

     Govindan added many new features to RSd, including configuration
     and transparent passing of BGP MEDs, BGP route flap dampening,
     aggregation, and AS path matching.  Support for BGP MEDs and BGP
     route flap dampening has already been added back into GateD,
     greatly strengthening the GateD code base.  Other new features to
     be added back include the recent multiprotocol extensions to BGP,
     new attributes such as BGP communities, and the ability to handle
     larger reconfigurations more quickly.

     The merger gives GateD a richer parser and wider range of
     configuration options.  The shared code base will also simplify the
     process of reflecting future RSd improvements back into the GateD
     library.  The shared code will be released as part of GateD
     Consortium Release 7.0, to be available without charge for academic
     and research usage, i.e., any usage that provides research,
     learning or inspection of the code in an academic or commercial
     environment.  The only use that is not defined as "academic and
     research" is inclusion of GateD in a product, or as a means of
     providing a commercial service.

     Gerald Winters attended a "Directory-Enabled Networks" workshop
     presented by Microsoft and Cisco.  The goal of the workshop was to

     This work has been presented in a couple of seminars to Berkeley,
     BT labs and Cambridge University Computer Society. The idea is
     complimentary to the current work on Differentiated Services in the
     IETF (also mentioned in earlier HIPPARCH work).

     The CAIRN link was used to transmit the mbone presentation of this
     work to Berkeley, and operated faultlessly.

     * New RFCs added to queue throughout the month

     The Requests for Comments (RFCs) are a series of notes, started in
     1969, about the Internet (originally the ARPANET). The notes
     discuss many aspects of computing and computer communication



Ramos                                                          [Page 29]

Internet Monthly Report                                    November 1997


     focusing in networking protocols, procedures, programs, and
     concepts, but also including meeting notes, opinion, and sometimes
     humor. The specification documents of the Internet protocol suite,
     as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and its
     steering group (the IESG), are published as RFCs.

     RFCs-to-be are edited by the RFC Editor.  RFCs enter the RFC
     Editor's work queue either by an action of the IESG or by
     independent submission.  Most independent submissions are referred
     to the IESG to check for overlap with IETF work.  The IESG might
     put a hold on a document to gather more input from its members.
     The wait for an RFC to be published varies as there can be
     unforeseen complications (typically editorial matters that need
     clarification from the author).  Documents can be removed from the
     publication queue if they are found to be insufficient or incorrect
     or if the IESG asks the author to join work already in progress in
     the IETF.
