Group the accomplishments, milestones reached, or problems discovered by
the participating organizations.

     This report is for Internet information purposes only, and is not
     to be quoted in other publications without permission from the
     submitter.

Each organization is expected to submit a 1/2 page report on the first
business day of the month describing the previous month's activities.

These reports should be submitted via network mail to:

     Ann Westine Cooper (Cooper@ISI.EDU)

     NSF Regional reports - To obtain the procedure describing how to
     submit information for the Internet Monthly Report, send an email
     message to mailserv@is.internic.net and put "send imr-procedure" in
     the body of the message (add only that one line; do not put a
     signature).

Requests to be added or deleted from the Internet Monthly report list
should be sent to "imr-request@isi.edu".

     Details on obtaining the current IMR, or back issues, via FTP or
     EMAIL may be obtained by sending an EMAIL message to "rfc-
     info@ISI.EDU" with the message body "help: ways_to_get_imrs".  For
     example:

             To: rfc-info@ISI.EDU

                   IETF MONTHLY REPORT for October, 1993

     1. The 28th meeting of the IETF, co-hosted by SESQUINET and Rice
        University, was held in Houston, Texas from November 1-5, 1993.
        The first meeting of the IETF in 1994 will be held in Seattle,
        Washington from March 29 through April 1, 1994. This meeting is
        being hosted by NorthWestNet.

        Following the March 1994 meeting, it looks like the IETF will
        be in Toronto in July, and in the San Francisco Bay Area in the
        fall. Once the final arrangements have been made, notifications
        will be sent to the IETF Announcement list. Remember that
        information on future IETF meetings can be always be found in
        the file 0mtg-sites.txt which is located on the IETF shadow
        directories.

     2. The IESG has determined how documents from the IPng candidates
        will be treated when they are submitted to the IESG for
        publication as RFCs.

        a. All IPng-related documents will be submitted for publication
           as RFCs in normal fashion; that is, as soon as the working
           group and the area directorate recommends that the IESG
           review them for publication. All IPng-related RFCs will be
           published with Experimental status. All IPng-related RFCs
           will remain in Experimental status until a single IPng is
           selected.

        b. At some point, one IPng shall be selected, and it will be
           moved onto the standards track as defined in RFC1310 (or its
           successor). An Applicability Statement will be prepared to
           assign a status of "Recommended" as the Common IPng for
           Internet interoperability.

        c. Once a "Common IPng" protocol has been selected, the other
           (former) IPng candidates will be treated in normal fashion.
           That is, they may eventually be moved to Historic status, or,
           if recommended by the working group and area directorate,
           they may be moved onto the standards track. However, because
           there can be only one level three protocol with a status of
           "Recommended as the Common IPng for Internet
           interoperability", an Applicability Statement must be
           prepared that clearly distinguishes between the subject
           protocol and the "Recommended Common IPng".

     3. The IESG approved or recommended the following nine Protocol
        Actions during the month of October, 1993:

        o  MOSPF: Analysis and Experience as an Informational document

        o  OSPF Version 2 as a Draft Standard

        o  Multicast Extensions to OSPF as a Proposed Standard

        o  The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) as a Draft Standard

        o  Requirements for an Internet Standard Point-to-Point Protocol
           as an Informational document

     4. The IESG issued four Last Calls to the IETF during the month of
        October, 1993:

        o  Classical IP and ARP over ATM <draft-ietf-atm-classic-ip-05>
           being considered as a Proposed Standard

        o  OSPF Version 2 <draft-ietf-ospf-version2-04> being considered
           as a Draft Standard

        o  Multicast Extensions to OSPF <draft-ietf-mospf-multicast-04>

INTERNET PROJECTS
-----------------

ANSNET/NSFNET BACKBONE ENGINEERING
----------------------------------

     Network Status Summary
     ======================

     A major T3 network hardware & software upgrade is planned to begin
     deployment on November 6th.  This upgrade will include several T3
     router performance enhancements.  New rcp_routed routing software
     was deployed in October.  New GateD routing software is expected to
     begin deployment in November.  A new CNSS node was installed in
     Albuquerque, New Mexico to support T3 services.

     October Backbone Traffic and Routing Statistics
     ===============================================

     The total inbound packet count for the network (measured using SNMP
     interface counters) was 43,689,832,748 on T3 ENSS interfaces, up
     21.9% from September.  The total packet count into the network
     including all ENSS serial interfaces was 51,080,653,716 up 22.4%
     from September.

     Major T3 Network Upgrade Planned
     ================================

     Starting on November 6th, a major upgrade to the T3 ANSnet/NSFnet
     Service will be deployed.  We are calling this the "Phase-5
     upgrade" since it represents the 5th major change to network
     infrastructure that we have made since 1991.  The infrastructure
     upgrade to the T3 network will begin deployment on Friday 11/6 in
     Seattle and Denver, and will continue at each T3 ENSS site and CNSS
     POP location during pre-scheduled weekend maintenance windows
     through 12/18.  The major changes included in this upgrade are:

     o     Upgrade of all DS3/HSSI router serial interface adapters (T3
           CNSS and ENSS) to support full DS3 bandwidth.  The router
           adapter bus interface cards will also be upgraded to double
           the packet switching rates per interface.

     o     The architecture for interconnection among CNSS routers at
           each MCI POP location will be upgraded from point-to-point
           links to a common FDDI ring.

     o     The T3 DSUs on each DS3 interface will replaced with a T3
           bandwidth manager (T3Plus BMX45) to accommodate T3 CNSS-CNSS



Cooper                                                         [Page 10]

           circuits and a Larscom Access-T45 DSU on each end of a T3
           ENSS-CNSS circuit.

     o     New system software and microcode will be installed (already
           in progress) prior to the hardware deployment to support the
           increased adapter performance.  Routing software has already
           been deployed to support the new CNSS FDDI ring architecture.

     Deployment Schedule Summary
     ---------------------------

     The upgrade will be deployed in six steps, commencing on Friday
     evening November 6th, and ending on the weekend of December 18th.
     the upgrade will be suspended for the week of Thanksgiving.  Some
     deployment details and the deployment schedule follow below:

     -     The T3Plus BMX45N bandwidth managers will be installed
           on the first POP visit.  CNSS sites will have multiple
           visits to upgrade the backbone links.

     -     T3 ENSS sites are visited once and are upgraded
           concurrent with the adjacent DS3 linked CNSS.

     -     The ANS NOC will create a planned maintenance trouble
           ticket with the ENSS site well in advance of maintenance
           and will confirm with the site a few days in advance.

     -     All parts will be delivered to the ENSS site on the
           Thursday preceding the scheduled Friday evening upgrade.

     Rcp_routed Routing Software Changes
     ===================================

     Rcp_routed maintenance continued in preparation for the upcoming T3
     network upgrade and GateD deployment.  The "Both IBGP and EBGP
     Aggregation" version or rcp_routed was deployed early in October.
     The "Both IBGP and EBGP Aggregation" version further improves
     performance, and also allows the CNSS nodes to be interconnected
     using a FDDI ring rather than point-to-point interfaces within the
     carrier POPs.

     A new version of rcp_routed will be installed in early November.
     This version more efficiently processes policy information (see



Cooper                                                         [Page 12]

     below).

     Routing Stability Measured on the T3 Network
     ============================================

     Internal routing stability measurements are made by monitoring
     short term disconnect times (disconnects of five minutes duration
     or less).  This is intended as a measure of stability rather than
     complete connectivity.  Steady improvement that has been observed
     since June.

            MONTH               overall              excluding configs
            ------              -------              -----------------

     The figures above exclude logs collected at the ENSS200 router
     which was used to provide temporary T3 connectivity for a trade
     show. While there was no stability problems with this node, it was
     never xntp time synchronized and its skewed timestamps tended to
     make any minor instabilities during that week appear longer than
     they were.  Stability figures for ENSS200 are included by virtue of
     the logging information collected on it's IBGP neighbors.

     Severe route flap outside of ANSnet affected rcp_routed in October.
     A rogue application was discovered walking through the IP address
     space, starting with the class A numbers and transmitting UDP echo
     packets to these destinations.  This affected routers outside
     ANSnet, which had difficulty processing the ICMP unreachable
     messages to be sent.  The volume of route flaps affected ENSS nodes
     with a very large number of configured peer network announcements
     (5000-8000 networks).  The efficiency of the run time search
     through configured policy information in rcp_routed was improved to
     prevent this in the future.  ENSS136, ENSS144, and ENSS145 were
     affected.  The source network responsible for the rogue application
     was isolated and the UDP echo packets have since ceased.

     ENSS160 (ANS Elmsford) experienced numerous crashes due a hardware
     failure which was subsequently fixed.

     ENSS138 saw instability associated with the cutover of a new T3
     circuit.  Instabilities were recorded as part of the cutover.

     Other than the specific problems cited above, power problems on the
     customer premise was responsible for the greatest amount of
     measured instability.

     A new router system software build was installed at a few T3 ENSS
     sites, causing limited instability of on the order of 10 minutes.
     Two new versions of rcp_routed were installed during October.
     Route convergence has improved, limiting the disruption of a
     backbone wide routing daemon install to about 5 minutes.

     The number of nodes experiencing more than 30 minutes accumulated
     has been significantly reduced.  The vast majority of nodes had
     less than 15 minutes of accumulated instability over the course of
     the month.  The breakdown by sites is as follows (these figures
     include instabilities recorded during configuration runs):

     GateD Deployment Update
     =======================

     During October we continued testing the initial GateD release for
     the T3 network that supports BGP4 and interoperability with
     rcp_routed.  A recent change resulting from testing involves
     improved protocol processing during large route downloads from the
     AIX kernel to the packet forwarding adapters.  We expect deployment

     Albuquerque POP Installation
     ============================

     On November 5th a new CNSS node will be added to the T3 ANSnet in
     Albuquerque, New Mexico.  This CNSS will initially support two new
     T3 ENSS sites in Albuquerque (Sandia National Laboratories and
     Phillips Laboratories).  Within the next few months, additional
     CNSS equipment will be added to support the attachment of other
     networks in the Albuquerque region.

     Notable Outages in October '93
     ==============================

     UNAM (Mexico) suffered an extended circuit outages on 10/01 and
     10/21.

     E173 (ITESM) suffered an extended outage on 10/3 due to power
     problems.

     EBS2 (Cern) suffered extended circuit outages on 10/5, 10/6, and
     10/10.

     E173 (ITESM) suffered an extended circuit outage on 10/11.

     E141 (Boulder) and E142 (Salt Lake) lost T3 connectivity on 10/12
     due to hardware problems due to hardware problems on a core router.

     Real-Time Multicast (Communications)
     ------------------------------------

     Work in September concentrated on testing and demonstrating the
     various network capabilities developed in the project.  With the
     help of other DARTnet researchers, we performed several tests on
     the DARTnet testbed of multi-level flows, RCOs (Resource
     Coordination Objects), and shared streams.  These tests used a
     modified version of the "nv" video-conferencing program that
     supports multi-level video data flows (described in last month's
     report), and the standard version of the VAT audio-conferencing
     tool, which was used for a shared-stream-based audio conference.

     The shared-stream experiment uses RCOs to propagate reservation
     information for each VAT audio source, which share common bandwidth
     where the flows overlap in the network.  The Fair Share resource-

     enforcement mechanism was used to enforce the bandwidth
     reservations for the multicast flows.

     Inter Domain Policy Routing
     ---------------------------

     During the months of September and October, we made considerable
     progress on our implementation of multicast and multipath routing
     for IDPR.  This involved changes to the procedures for generating
     routes, setting up paths, and distributing routing information.
     Although only minor changes to the IDPR protocols are required to
     support both multicast and multipath routing, the software for
     route generation and path setup required extensive redesign to
     support these features.  We expect to start testing in December.

CONCERT
-------

     CONCERT has received two NSF Connections Grants allowing for the
     connection of 16 Universities / Colleges/ Community Colleges in the
     State of North Carolina.

     The communications research group's resource management experiment
     has been slowed down a bit due to switching to Solaris 2.2.
     However, the real time (RT) scheduling class in Solaris 2.2 seems
     to be useful for a number of networking and multimedia experiments.
     For example, we expect to use this support in implementing a leaky
     bucket mechanism and in implementing an audio echo cancellation
     algorithm.

     Work is underway to port the University of Virginia,
     Charlottesville implementation of XTP(version 3.6) for the IBM RISC
     6000 platforms running AIX to the Cray-YMP-EL running UNICOS. This
     implementation of XTP is more efficient compared to the KRM version
     (KRM 1.6 and 1.7) that was ported to the Cray earlier this year.

     An updated version of the packet video catalog listing packet audio
     and video packages (based on the previous work of to Chris Adie)
     will be  placed on the ftp site ftp.concert.net early this week.
     This is a live document and will be updated periodically as new
     packages are announced and existing ones evolve.

     DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES

     Since there are many potential users whose sole access to the
     Internet is through electronic mail, InterNIC Directory and
     Database Services supports a mail server that gives access to many
     of our services.

     Complete instructions for use of the mail server are available by
     sending mail to mailserv@ds.internic.net and putting the word
     "help" (without the quotes) in the BODY of the message.

     We have tried to make as many services as possible available
     through the mail server, including access to all files available
     via FTP and the ability to search our Directory of Directories.  A
     few of our services (e.g. Netfind) require interaction between the
     user and the service, so they are not available through the mail
     server.

     The basic services available include:

     - access to all files on our server that can be reached by FTP

     - access to X.500 and WHOIS directory searches

     - directory of directories searches by topic



Cooper                                                         [Page 20]

Internet Monthly Report                                     October 1993


     - keyword searches of our document collection

     We also support access to archie by mail.  For compatability with
     the rest of the archie world, archie is accessed by sending mail to
     "archie" rather than sending mail to "mailserv".

     To help spread the load a bit, there are a few restrictions on use
     of the mail server:

     - each message is limited to 15 queries and file transfer requests

     - the information returned by file transfer is limited to 500K
     bytes

     - CPU time for message processing is limited to 15 seconds

     One frequent cause of errors with the mail server is that the
     command is put on the "Subject:" line rather than in the body of
     the message.  Since our server accepts multiple commands per
     message, we accept commands from the body of the message rather
     than the "Subject:" line.

     A reminder - if you would like to help the Internet community find
     a resource that you offer, send mail to admin@ds.internic.net and
     we will send information about listing your resource in the
     Directory of Directories.

     REGISTRATION SERVICES

     I. Significant Events

     During the month of October, the InterNIC changed the menu
     selections on the 1-800 number.  Customers calling the numbers are
     now being referred to #1 Information Services, #2 Directory and
     Database Services, and #3 Registration Services.  This change
     reduced confusion for callers and for InterNIC staff members.

     The Internet continues to grow every month.  According to our
     statistics there are over 12,252 domains in the InterNIC database
     and we also registered a record 729 inverse addresses as well. The
     Internet is becoming more popular than it's ever been and the
     general public is reaping the benefits.

     GIGABIT NETWORKING

     Atomic Project

     Our principal research this month has focused on three topics:

        1) Installation and testing of the 100' ATOMIC cables.

        2) High-level design of the PC-ATOMIC interface for
           the Gateway 486 DX66V personal computer.

        3) Release of ATOMIC Software.

        4) Testing of a 64-processor Mosaic board.

     1) We have installed two ATOMIC cables and have integrated them
        into normal operation of the LAN. One cable is 100' long and the
        other is 120' long. Each have been tested at about 300Mb/s and
        have been running for several weeks without significant
        problems.

     2) We have been actively examining various design alternatives for
        this VL-Bus ATOMIC interface card.  Recently we have decided to
        replace the Memoryless Mosaic chips in our design with the
        forthcoming Lanai chip that should be available in January.

        Pinouts will be available in December, so our complete board
        layout will begin at that time.  The Lanai chip is optimized for
        network interfacing and will include some features for real-time
        scheduling.

     3) We have moved the Address Consultant code into the kernel This
        makes the code more portable to operating systems other than SUN
        OS and allows sites without a source license to install the
        ATOMIC device driver into their systems. The code has been made
        available to selected sites with ATOMIC hardware.

     4) We recently installed a 64-processor Mosaic-C board as the main
        switch in our LAN. It provides 16 bidirectional ports for
        connecting hosts or other switches. We have verified its correct
        operation and are working on integrating it into the network.

     MULTIMEDIA CONFERENCING

     This month, we publicly released mmcc, the multimedia conference
     control program.  Mmcc is a session orchestration tool that allows
     a user to explicitly invite others to participate in a conference,
     and alerts them to accept or decline.  Mmcc is an X-based tool that
     provides both point-to-point and multipoint teleconferences.  It
     automatically spawns underlying audio, video and groupware programs
     among members of a session, then tears them down at session
     completion.  Currently, mmcc brings up vat by default, and offers
     the option to start nv and wb, but in the future we'd like to
     support other MBone tools as well.  Mmcc will distribute a session
     key for confidential sessions.  In this preliminary version, the
     key is sent in the clear, so it is not secure, but eventually we
     expect to use other techniques for secure key distribution.

     Mmcc aims to supplement the large open-style sessions supported by
     the existing version of sd.  It complements the hailing-channel
     approach of public sessions with a more private session style for
     smaller conferences.  Thus, session advertisement is internal to
     the group of participating conferees.  The mmcc release software is
     available via anonymous FTP from "ftp.isi.edu:confctrl/mmcc.tar.Z".

     The Realtime Transport Protocol (RTP) specification from the IETF
     Audio/Video Transport working group has been augmented to provide
     for application-specific option number assignment and to clarify
     and explain a number of points.  With these edits completed, the
     document has been submitted to the IESG for the "Last Call" before
     publication as an RFC.

     At the close of October, Merit has grown to ten member institutions
     and 60 affiliates.  Northern Michigan University in Marquette is
     the newest Merit Member.  NMU will initially have two 56Kbps
     attachments, one linking the university to the MichNet node at
     Michigan Technological University and the other to the backbone
     node in Grand Rapids.  NMU will host the Marquette MichNet dial-in,

     as well as Michigan State University facilities.  The Rapid
     Response Manufacturing Center in Redford, Michigan will be
     connected at 56Kbps to the MichNet node at Wayne State University.
     The manufacturing technology and research organization, sponsored
     by the National Center for Manufacturing Sciences, will fund its
     MichNet connection through a grant from the National Institute for
     Science and Technology (NIST).

     Jackson Community College recently upgraded to a 56Kbps link with
     the assistance of an NSF Connections grant.  JCC also participated
     with Merit in upgrading the Jackson area MichNet dial-in service,
     bringing additional phone lines into the Jackson hunt group.  The
     new modems will also be compatible with Merit's planned Network
     Access Servers (NAS) scheduled for deployment throughout the
     MichNet backbone in 1994.

     The Livingston PortMaster at the University of Michigan MichNet
     site is now in production.  The dial-in access offered through the
     UM/MichNet NAS is currently limited to PPP (Point-to-Point
     Protocol) access only and requires authentication.  Access will be
     broadened to include dumb-terminal emulation in the future.  NAS
     configuration is specified for flexibility in modem speeds, error
     correction and data compression.

     Sandra Waite represented Merit/MichNet interests at "Building
     Consensus/Building Models for K12 Networking Assistance," a project
     funded by the National Science Foundation and carried out by FARNET
     and CoSN (the Consortium for School Networking).  This new
     initiative will work to bring together leaders in K12 education,
     networking and public policy to develop models for successful
     technical assistance to schools implementing school-based networks.
     Dana Sitzler, Merit K-12 Outreach Coordinator, participated in the

     MERIT/NSFNET INTERNET ENGINEERING
     ---------------------------------

     This report contains a summary of recent activities of Merit's
     Internet Engineering Group. These include development of
     capabilities in the Policy Routing Database system to represent,
     generate NSFNET/ANS backbone configuration files, and test new
     software, for deployment of the CIDR and BGP-4 routing
     architecture. Additionally, Merit staff have made progress on
     implementation of a "CIDR Aggregate Registry", described in RFC
     1482, for registration of aggregated routing information between
     providers.

     In early October, Merit hosted a meeting of the Regional-Techs
     group, which discussed a number of topics related to coordination
     among providers for CIDR deployment and registration of routing
     information.  The Shared Whois Project (SWIP) is an ongoing joint
     project between InterNIC, RIPE NCC and Merit.

     Policy Routing Database Changes and CIDR Deployment

     In preparation for deployment of the GateD routing daemon on the
     ANS backbone, supporting the BGP-4 protocol for CIDR, changes were
     completed in the Merit/NSFNET PRDB in order to support inbound
     acceptance and outbound announcement of route aggregates.  The PRDB
     can now generate GateD configuration files for the ANSNET backbone.
     These files can include configuration for the new BGP-4 features.
     Merit engineers are cooperating with the ANS backbone engineering
     staff in testing GateD operation on the T3 research network, and in
     the initial deployment of the new version of GateD on the
     Washington DC to Geneva, Switzerland circuit.

     The initial production deployment of the PRDB changes for CIDR will
     include a change in the notation of network numbers to the
     classless format ("x.x.x/len"). This change will be visible to all
     external users of whois or the PRDB reports. The whois server
     commands will start using the new notation, and ans_core.now,
     country.now, and net-comp.now will be replaced with their new
     versions (currently produced as ans_core.cidr, country.cidr, and
     net-comp.cidr).  Prefix lengths of 8, 16, or 24 will be put into



Cooper                                                         [Page 31]

Internet Monthly Report                                     October 1993


     the PRDB for all existing nets with classes A, B and C
     respectively.

     The Network Announcement Change Request (NACR) templates, both e-
     mail and interactive client interfaces, will be changed to accept
     aggregated announcements. Once GateD is deployed, BGP-4 will be
     supported initially without announcing or accepting aggregated
     routes, however.  After BGP-4 appears to be stable, controlled
     experiments with aggregation will be done in cooperation with
     regional and midlevel networks.

     Still to be implemented in the database is the "proxy aggregation"
     as described in RFC 1482. In this case the backbone can be
     configured to aggregate on behalf of the regional network in
     response to the announcement of one or a set of network numbers
     comprising the total aggregate. This feature will be supported by
     the time NACR support for aggregation is made available.

     CIDR Aggregate Registry

     Changes to the Aggregate Registry function described in RFC 1482
     were made at the October Regional-Techs meeting. The original
     proposed functionality was split into a Aggregate Registry (one
     entry per aggregate, with source AS) and a possible separate Routed
     Net registry giving AS topology with aggregate announcements.
     Initially these registries will list only network prefixes which
     are not class A/B/C nets, but the longer term goal is to allow all
     nets regardless of class to be returned by the same server. The
     Aggregate Registry project will be implemented first as it is a
     relatively straightforward project, with the Routed Net Registry
     project being implemented next.

     It is expected that these registries will be of assistance in the
     global BGP-4 tunnel testbed led by Andrew Partan and Peter
     Lothberg.

     Regional-Techs Meeting

     A meeting of the Regional-Techs group was held in Ann Arbor on
     October 4-5. The focus of the meeting was to discuss CIDR
     Deployment, routing registration, and NSFNET transition issues with
     respect to coordination among network providers. The group decided
     that it will be important to broaden its scope to include any
     interested network providers rather than restrict the discussion to
     NSFNET-attached regionals and midlevels. It was decided that for
     the foreseeable future, Merit will continue to host the group, but
     meetings may be held at different locations with other network
     provider sponsors.  A suggestion for a new name for the group was

     SWIP Project

     The Shared Whois Project is a joint project between Merit, RIPE NCC
     and InterNIC to synchronize data among the Internet numbering and
     routing registries, and implement various databases and implement
     automatic update procedures.  It is a goal of the three
     organizations to synchronize data by April, 1994 and begin to use
     the update procedures at that time. A working document can be found

NORTHWESTNET
-------------

     NorthWestNet's Annual Meeting was held from October 12-15 at the
     Seattle Hilton with approximately 310 registered participants.  In
     addition to 5 keynote presentations and 21 track sessions, a 7.5
     hour, three part series on libraries and computing centers was held
     to examine the evolving relationships between these two groups.
     The series examined areas of overlap and conflict--from mission
     statements to solving users problems--and through dialogue began
     exploring the foundations of cooperative production and
     distribution of integrated, electronic information services.

     Keynote presentations included an inspired and fresh view of what
     the Internet and K-12 can bring to each other (Fred Dust, The Bush
     School); an overview of the current NSFNET backbone and NREN
     (Richard Mandelbaum, NYSERNet); a look at national NII policy under
     development (Charles McClure, Syracuse University); an examination
     of cooperative ventures and commercial interests in the development
     of the NII (Jim Elias, US West); and an overview of the current
     state of, and future opportunities for, NorthWestNet (Eric Hood,
     NorthWestNet).

     All NorthWestNet governance and representative committees--
     executive committee, board of directors, institutional
     representatives, technical services representatives, and user
     services representatives--convened in conjunction with the Annual

     Meeting.

     Two major new services for NorthWestNet members were unveiled in
     October.  First, a NorthWestNet Gopher, that includes an online,
     searchable version of "The Internet Passport," was announced and
     made available to our member communities.  Second, the Willow
     graphical information retrieval tool, designed by the University of
     Washington, is also now available to the NorthWestNet member
     community for use in accessing online, text-based bibliographic
     databases.

     We welcome our newest NorthWestNet member, R.S. Dow Neurological

     We demonstrated multiway Internet and ISDN conferencing at Interop
     in Paris all week. Mark Handley also presented two papers, on the
     MIE project and on a comparison of the various multicast schemes
     proposed by the members of the IDMR group.

     We had ISDN calls to a variety of places, and then used the MICE
     CMMC to mix them into an Internet multiway conference with audio,
     video and whiteboards.

     An effective demonstration tool has developed - the use of the game
     person a word, which they then attempt to draw in a wb, and the
     other particpants attempt to guess what the word was. Winner is
     frst correct guess, and chooses next word.

     While running this, we have been working on a tool for helping
     diagnose mbone problems based on background monitoring of the
     topology with a triggered traceroute -g on any suspect route, via
     the first hop mrouted, to the destination one.
