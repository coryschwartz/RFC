                  IETF Monthly Report for November, 1994

     1. As I write this report, we are getting ready for the 31st
        meeting of the IETF to be held in San Jose, California from
        December 5-9, 1994, and by the time the Internet Monthly Report
        is distributed, the word will be out that this was the largest
        meeting ever. Over 900 people have pre-registered for this
        meeting, and I anticipate breaking the 1000 attendee mark.

        The IETF meetings for 1995 have firmed up. The IETF will be
        meeting in Danvers, Massachusetts (a suburb of Boston) from
        April 3-7, 1995. The summer IETF meeting will be held in
        Stockholm, Sweden the week of July 17-21, 1995. Due to the costs
        to be incurred, the IETF attendance fee for the Stockholm
        meeting will be US$300.

        The final meeting for 1995 will be held in Dallas, Texas. While
        contracts have not yet been signed, it looks like the meeting
        will be December 4-8, 1995. Once all the arrangements have been
        made, notifications will be sent to the IETF Announcement list.
        Remember that information on future IETF meetings can be always
        be found in the file 0mtg-sites.txt which is located on the IETF
        shadow directories. This information can also be viewed from the
        IETF Home Page on the Web. The URL is:

                     http://www.ietf.cnri.reston.va.us


     2. The minutes of the IESG teleconferences have been publicly
        available on the IETF Shadow directories since 1991. These files
        are placed in the /ftp/iesg directory.

        The following IESG minutes have been added:

           October 20, 1994 (iesg.94-10-20)
           November 3, 1994 (iesg.94-11-03)


     3. The IESG approved or recommended the following 15 Protocol
        Actions during the month of November, 1994:

ANSNET BACKBONE ENGINEERING REPORT
----------------------------------

     Network Status Summary
     =======================

     ANSnet total packet traffic increased by about 5.28% in November
     '94.  An increase in the ANSnet forwarding table size of 3.29% was
     observed during the month of November.


     August Backbone Traffic Statistics
     ==================================

     The total inbound packet count for the ANSnet (measured using SNMP
     interface counters) was 90,014,646,313 on T3 ENSS interfaces, up
     5.28% from October.  The total packet count into the network
     including all ENSS serial interfaces was 100,925,726,278 up 4.83%
     from October.


     Router Forwarding Table Statistics
     ==================================

     The maximum number of destinations announced to ANSnet during
     November was 19,507 up 3.29% from October.

     The number of network destinations configured for announcement to
     the ANSnet but never announced (silent nets) during November was
     20,294.


     BGP-4/CIDR Deployment Status
     ============================

     As of December 1st '94, we have observed the withdrawal of 9,671
     class based destinations from the ANSnet router forwarding tables
     that are now represented by 2,246 configured aggregates.  Among
     these configured aggregates:

        1,643 of these are top-level aggregates (not nested in another
        aggregate).

        1,309 of these are actively announced to ANSnet.

        898 of these have at least one subnet configured (the other
        411 may be saving the Internet future subnet announcements).

Internet Monthly Report                                    November 1994


        771 of these have resulted in the withdrawal of at least one
        configured more specific route.

        759 of these have resulted in the withdrawal of 50% of their
        configured more specific routes.

        701 of these have resulted in the withdrawal of most (80%+) of
        their more specific routes.

     For up-to-date information is available from merit.edu:
     pub/nsfnet/cidr/cidr_savings.

     For further details on these CIDR aggregates, see
     merit.edu:pub/nsfnet/cidr/nestings.announced for full listings.


     Routing Stability Measured on the T3 Network
     ============================================

     Internal routing stability  measurements are made  by monitoring
     short term disconnect  times (disconnects of five minutes duration
     or less).  This is intended as a measure of overall system
     stability  rather than complete connectivity.

     The greatest instability in November was contributed by a single T1
     ENSS node on November 1st due to a faulty circuit. The problem
     circuit was an Ameritech leg of a T1 tail circuit provisioned
     through MCI which turned out to be a bad smartjack at the customer
     premise.  This caused a very high level of packet loss. There were
     other problems, most notably an FDDI problem at the Hayward POP.

     Monthly histograms of the number of nodes experiencing instability
     follows.  A lengthy T1 ENSS212 outage contributed about 5 hours of
     instability to the November data (which was excluded below). If
     this node is excluded from the data, very little instability in the
     other nodes is evident.  ENSS136 experienced about 45 minutes of
     instability due to gated problem.  CNSS32 experienced 36 minutes of
     instability due to high routing load on a machine with 32 MB of
     memory (memory upgrade still pending).  ENSS213 and ENSS142 had
     just over 15 minutes of instability.  All others had under 15
     minutes of instability over the course of the month (>99.97%
     stable).

     INTERNIC DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES

     We recently added additional disk capacity to our primary server,
     and will soon install more disk on the two backup machines.  This
     storage will permit us to support a local copy of the AIDS Patent
     Database we described in the October IMR.  It also provides the
     storage we need to support the latest version of Archie on our
     primary server (ds0.internic.net), and it has now been installed.

     As noted in the August IMR when we put the new Archie up on one of
     our backup servers, the new version supports searches for Gopher
     menu items as well as anonymous FTP file names.

     To search Archie for Gopher menu items, Gopher to ds0.internic.net
     or ds1.internic.net, and select "InterNIC Directory and Database
     Services" (item 4), "Search Anonymous FTP Site and Gopher Menu
     Indices using Archie" (item 8), and then "Gopher Index" (item 3).
     At that point, you might want to start with item 8 "Things you
     should know" and continue through item 13 to get an idea of how to
     use the system.  If you do not have a Gopher client of your own,
     you can telnet to ds0.internic.net or ds1.internic.net, log in as
     gopher, and follow the same steps.  We will install the new Archie
     on our third server once additional disk storage has been
     installed.

     A reminder - if you would like to help the Internet community find
     a resource that you offer, send mail to admin@ds.internic.net and
     we will send information about listing your resource in the
     Directory of Directories.

     NETSTATION
     ==========

     Both Steve Hotz and Vivek Goyal joined the project this month.

     Focus this month has been centered primarily upon the model desired
     for ownership and access of a Network Virtual Device (NVD).  Since
     this project is interfacing devices directly to the Internet,
     questions of booting, ownership and access control arise in a new
     context.

     Device ownership is straightforward when a device is controlled via
     the system bus.  The bus master, usually the CPU, owns the device
     and controls it exclusively, by means of a memory-mapped commands
     issued by device driver.  But if a device is instead interfaced and
     controlled via a gigabit network, its commands must come across the
     network as packets, with any host able to send it packets.

     A de-facto emulation of the bus control methodology used today is
     possible.  That is, an NVD could restrict its acceptable commands
     to only those sent from a specific Owner host, which corresponds to
     the CPU as bus master, with the Owner's address stored in the NVD
     as non-volatile memory.  The Owner could send memory read/write
     commands as packets to the device.

     That model of access and control would be a nearly direct
     substitution of a network for the system bus, and as long as
     latency was sufficiently low, it would work.  However, it
     incorporates constraints that are no longer necessary nor desirable
     in a network-based architecture.

     In a bus-based architecture, a device and its Owner are physically
     connected.  Ownership is explicit.  For an NVD, the Owner is not
     necessarily physically connected.  Ownership can be both dynamic
     and freely determined.

     The Owner of an NVD does not control it directly via memory
     read/write, but indirectly, by means of packet exchange.  The
     device driver must be split between the Owner and the NVD, with a
     protocol for access and control well-understood between them.

     After evaluating a number of alternative ownership-association
     strategies, we have tentatively adopted the following model for
     ownership.  When an NVD is operating and accessible it will have
     one "Owner".  That owner may be either the NVD itself, a general



Cooper                                                         [Page 21]

Internet Monthly Report                                    November 1994


     NVD Manager (NVDM) process, or some owning process at another
     Internet host.

     An Owner is responsible for controlling access to any NVD that it
     owns.  The Owner is responsible for processing and filtering NVD
     access-request messages and either granting or denying access to
     the NVD.

     An NVD is inaccessible for use until its ownership has been
     established.  When an NVD is inaccessible, it immediately discards
     all incoming messages except those required to maintain link-layer
     connectivity.

     When an NVD boots, it determines its default ownership and passes
     ownership to its Default Owner.  The Default Owner will be either
     itself or its NVDM.  If its NVDM is inaccessible, the NVD remains
     inaccessible until it can establish contact and pass ownership to
     its NVDM.  Each NVD must have memory that stores it ownership
     status and the Internet address of its Owner.

     Filtering Access Requests

     Assume that the location of an NVD has already been determined by
     an external process that wishes access to that NVD.  Obtaining
     access to an NVD is a four-stage procedure.

       (1) An access-request message is sent directly to the target NVD
           by the process that wishes to access that NVD.

       (2) The NVD forwards that message to its Owner.

       (3) The Owner then filters the access-request and either decides
           to grant it or deny access.  It builds a reply and sends
           that reply back to the target NVD.

       (4) The target NVD creates from that reply a message that it
           sends back to the source of the original access-request
           message.  If the Owner is not the NVD itself, the Internet
           address or name of the Owner is not sent in the reply.

     In the case that the target NVD owns itself, steps (2) and (3) are
     performed by the target NVD itself.

     The access-requesting process must implement a reasonable time-out
     in the event that no reply is received before it may re-request
     access to the same target NVD.  That time-out MUST NOT be shorter
     than 5 seconds.

Internet Monthly Report                                    November 1994


     No restriction is placed upon the filtering function execution
     other than that a reply message be sent back to the requesting
     process in a timely manner.  An upper limit of 1 second to complete
     this procedure is suggested.

     Owner Failure

     If an NVD's Owner fails (halts, crashes, or reboots), that Owner
     loses ownership of that NVD.  Discovery of this by the owned NVDs
     will occur in one of two ways:

       (1) The NVD expects a response from its owner and receives none
           within a mutually-agreed time limit.  The NVD will reassert
           its default ownership.

       (2) An access-request message arrives at a target NVD.  This
           message must be forwarded to the NVD's Owner.  An
           access-request message must be replied to in a timely
           manner.  Failure to reply in a timely manner results in
           the target NVD reasserting its default ownership.

     In the event that an Owner fails, the first subsequent access-
     request message will provoke a default ownership reponse from the
     target NVD.  Successive access-request messages that arrive at the
     target NVD will then be forwarded to the target's new Owner, which
     will normally result in a response message.

     The intent is that the assertion of default ownership implies that
     the NVD also "reset" itself, so that particular internal hardware
     resources that are dedicated to a previous owner are made available
     to the new owner.  This will often be equivalent to the state that
     an NVD was in just after it successfully booted.

     NVD Failure

     When an NVD itself fails, no response to repeated access-request
     messages will be received.  This is distinct from failure to be
     granted access by an Owner, which results in the generation of
     explicit access-failure return messages.

     PC-ATOMIC
     ---------

     We have completed the PC-ATOMIC prototype card, a i486 VL-Bus
     (VESA) interface for the MyriCom LANai processor and network
     interface. The card was developed to provide an interface to the
     MyriNet network for low-cost i486-based hosts. The board has been
     tested as compatible with the link-level of the SBus Myricom
     interfaces.

     Overview

     (full text available on
     ftp://ftp.isi.edu/pub/hpcc-papers/touch/pca_overview.txt)

     PC-ATOMIC is a i486 VL-bus (VESA, Video-Local) interface to the
     links of Myricom's implementation of the ATOMIC LAN. It requires
     one full-length slot in a 33-Mhz 1-waitstate motherboard. It
     provides a bidirectional 640-Mbps (80 Mbytes/sec, byte-wide)
     channel over Myricom links, and is link-compatible with Myricom's
     Sun SPARC SBus interface.

     Small quantities of the board are available from ISI as GFE for
     research purposes. The specifications and design of the board are
     also available.

     The PC-ATOMIC interface uses a 16-bit LANai 1.2 host interface
     processor, and provides 128 Kbytes of dual-access RAM (emulates
     dual-ported RAM).  The PC-ATOMIC board is memory-mapped, providing
     access to the RAM and memory-mapped registers. The registers
     provide:

             Internet checksum
                     accumulates all PIO reads, writes
                     can be reset to 0 via a register bit
             Disable/enable
                     Internet checksum
                     Board reset
                     LANai reset-and-hold/release (for programming)
                     LANai hardware interrupt signal to host

     The board also will support DMA in a future firmware release.

     This document refers to information from Myricom regarding their
     Sun SPARC 2.x host interface cards, LANai 1.2 programming
     information, and cable information. Contact Myricom for information
     on these items.

     The VL-side of the board runs at 33 Mhz (from the VL-Bus).  The
     LANai has two sides - one runs off the on-board link clock, the
     other runs at a rate compatible with the host. Because the current
     LANai 1.2 is limited to host-side clocks of 25 Mhz or less, its
     host-side is clocked at 1/2 the VL-Bus clock. The board can be
     reprogrammed if a 33 Mhz LANai 1.2 becomes available.

     The board also contains a LANai 1.2 subsystem, nearly identical to
     that of the Myricom 1.2 Sun SPARC SBus prototype cards. The PC-
     ATOMIC board is link-level compatible with the Myricom LANai 2.0
     SBus interfaces.  The LANai uses a separate on-board crystal for
     the link clocking, independent of the LANai host-side clocking.
     This crystal is set to 40 Mhz for compatibility with current
     Myricom host interfaces and switches. Other crystals can be used,
     so long as BOTH ENDS OF EACH LINK use the same crystal frequency,
     as per the Myricom literature.

     ATOMIC-2
     --------

     The ATOMIC-2 project extends the results of the ATOMIC project,
     which developed a LAN from supercomputer chips. ATOMIC-2 is
     implementing an ATOMIC-ATM IP-level gateway to extend ATOMIC beyond
     LAN boundaries. We are also implementing an ATOMIC disk server. We
     are continuing efforts to deliver a significant portion of ATOMIC's
     640 Mbps network bandwidth to the user application, subject to host
     backplane limitations.

     ATOMIC-ATM Gateway

     We are currently investigating the use of both the Naval Research
     Laboratory's PTAI2 ATM interface, and Fore Systems' SBA-200
     interface for building Atomic - ATM gateways.  We plan to implement
     IP level gateways using both interface systems (boards and device
     drivers).

     We installed Myricom's S-Bus 2.0 host interfaces and Fore SBA-200
     ATM cards on a Sun SPARC 20/51, and ran a simple IP gateway test.
     We found that the performance was dependent on packet size for UDP,
     but not as much for TCP. TCP performance was around 40
     megabits/second, and dropped only slightly for the gateway vs.
     unicast ATM or ATOMIC traffic. We believe this indicates that host
     processing is the bottleneck, and we are looking into alternate TCP
     implementations (TCP Vegas, X-kernel TCP, etc.).

     UDP performance was limited to near 75 Mbps for ATOMIC, and 100
     Mbps for even a 140 Mbps-capable ATM card. We are looking into
     modifying the host interfaces to transfer packets directly between
     each other, rather than involving host routing software.

                                   Protocol

     We were also able to measure the performance of the Myricom host
     interface for native ATOMIC packets. We found that the bandwidth
     depended on an interaction between packet size and page size for
     pages over 4K bytes. This was probably due to multi-page packet
     effects, due possibly to page swapping, TLB effects, or other page
     boundary effects. The 290 Mbps upper bound is related to the 320
     Mbps peak bandwidth of the SPARC SBus, combined with per-burst
     overhead of bus arbitration.

     Using DMA for data transfer increased bandwidth remarkably from the
     programmed I/O case. DMA achieves 290 Mbps as packet size
     increases, and PIO was limited to 78 Mbps.

     Because the ATOMIC interface is capable of higher packet bandwidth

     than ATM, we would expect ATOMIC UDP to be higher bandwidth than
     ATM, which is not the case.

     Providing Integrated Services in ATOMIC

     We are studying how to provide integrated services in ATOMIC.
     Integrated services are used to support real-time protocols (e.g.,
     RTP) and QoS reservation mechanisms (e.g., RSVP). We are
     implementing a subset of the core services proposed in the CSZ
     model, a service model for Integrated Services Packet Networks
     proposed by Clark, Shenker, and Zhang. Our aim is to design and
     implement packet scheduling algorithms on the source-routed cut-
     through networks (e.g., ATOMIC) to provide seamless integrates
     services over ATOMIC that are emerging on other LAN technologies.

     The CSZ model proposes a scheduling architecture to support their
     service model. Packet network systems that support configurable
     queuing at intermediate switches can implement this architecture by

     using multi-level queues.

     ATOMIC uses source-routed cut-through packet switching, with hard-
     wired "fair" switching at each stage and hardware backpressure,
     i.e., no queuing, and no programmable switching algorithm. ATOMIC
     will have to adjust source routing and the timing of packet
     emissions to emulate the multilevel queuing mechanism proposed by
     CSZ.

     We are currently considering schemes based on an emulation of
     switch reservation at the centralized arbiter (i.e., the route
     server), combined with frame-based leaky bucket mechanisms at the
     hosts (e.g., SNR).

     Using X-Kernel to support the ATOMIC-ATM gateway

     We are currently evaluating the x-Kernel (Peterson, Arizona) as a
     possible vehicle for protocol experiments that bypass the current
     BSD implementations of TCP/IP. We are seeking ways to provide
     higher bandwidth to the application, as well as a mechanism to
     support more efficient gatewaying using multiple host interfaces.
     We plan to use the x-Kernel to investigate experimental protocol
     implementations, e.g. TCP Vegas, and direct coupling of the lowest
     level of the x-Kernel and the drivers for various high-speed
     networks including ATOMIC and ATM.

     High performance authentication - Report on MD5 Performance

     (full text available from ftp://ftp.isi.edu/pub/hpcc-
     papers/touch/md5.txt)

     MD5 is an authentication algorithm, and has been proposed as one
     authentication option in IPv6. When enabled, the MD5 algorithm
     operates over the entire data packet, including header (with dummy
     values for volatile fields). We are concerned with how fast MD5 can
     be implemented in software and hardware, and whether it supports
     the network bandwidth we're installing here at ISI.

     RFC 1321 describes the MD5 algorithm and gives a reference
     implementation [1]. The Internet Draft draft-ietf-sipp-ap-04.txt
     describes the IPv6 authentication option, and MD5's role in it [2].

     We have found that MD5 cannot be implemented in existing technology
     at rates in excess of 267 Mbps, and cannot be implemented feasibly
     at rates in excess of 70 Mbps. These rates cannot support ISI's
     ATOMIC LAN (640 Mbps raw, 36 Mbps TCP, 75 Mbps UDP currently). We
     believe that if MD5 cannot support existing network bandwidth using
     existing technology, that situation will not change in the future.



Cooper                                                         [Page 28]

Internet Monthly Report                                    November 1994


     We ran a reference implementation of MD5 written in C posted by Jim
     Ellis at CERT.  Here are the data rates we got from the performance
     test "md5 -t", which tests 1000 1000-byte blocks through the code:

             13 Mbps         SPARC-2 SunOS 4.1.3
             20 Mbps         486/33 NetBSD
             23 Mbps         HP 9000/720
             36 Mbps         SPARC-10/51, SPARC-20/50 SunOS 4.1.3
             52 Mbps         SGI/IP-20 IRIX 5.2

     These rates do not keep up with the bandwidth we support for TCP or
     UDP at ISI.

     Our analysis indicates that the best software implementation can
     run in Mbps at 1.6x the MIPS rate of the computer, i.e., a 100 MIPS
     machine can support a 160 Mbps stream. These bounds are supported
     by our measurements, above.

     In hardware, our analysis indicates that the following rates are
     possible:

             CMOS    70 Mbps
             ECL     157 Mbps
             GaAs    267 Mbps

     These are also less than required for the ATOMIC LAN at ISI.

     We propose an alternative to MD5, that is 8- or 16-way block
     chained, rather than 1-way. We believe that the resulting algorithm
     achieves the goals of MD5 over MD4, but without the serialization
     penalty that prohibits high speed implementation. It would require
     further analysis to ensure that it provides an adequate level of
     security.

MERIT/NSFNET ENGINEERING
------------------------

     This report summarizes recent activities of Merit's Internet
     Engineering and Network Management groups on behalf of the Routing
     Arbiter Project and the NSFNET Backbone Service Project.

     ROUTING ARBITER PROJECT

     The production CNMS (Centralized Network Management System) is
     installed in the University of Michigan/Merit NOC, and installation
     of the centralized Rover code is almost complete.  Bill Norton has
     developed an architecture for distribution of Rover code and
     updates to the Route Servers.  A model for supporting a variety of
     data collectors on the Route Servers has been created, and the
     staff has designed a secure method for downloading collected NAP
     data to the CNMS.

     Joint tests conducted this month by Merit, IBM, and ISI verified
     that new Route Server software allows remote backup of the Route
     Servers, in the absence of dual Route Server connections at some
     NAPs.

     RIPE and Merit have completed the migration from the RIPE-81 syntax
     to the RIPE-181 syntax, and the Routing Arbiter Database (RADB) is
     up and running.  Installation of a second RADB system, for
     development and hot backup, is also complete.  The RADB is expected
     to replace the Policy Routing Database, used for the NSFNET



Cooper                                                         [Page 35]

Internet Monthly Report                                    November 1994


     Backbone Service, by the end of December.  The RADB itself forms
     part of the new Internet Routing Registry, which will incorporate
     registries maintained by several national and international
     networking organizations.  If you are a NSF sponsored regional
     network, a North American networking provider, or another provider
     and you need help in using or registering in the RADB, send a
     message to db-admin@merit.edu.

     John Scudder, Laurent Joncherey, and Craig Labovitz have been
     working to secure the Route Servers, Routing Arbiter Database
     systems, and Centralized Network Management System.  They installed
     s/key one-time password authentication with local modifications,
     installed several security audit packages, and improved security on
     staff machines at Merit.

     NSFNET BACKBONE SERVICE PROJECT

     Peering sessions have been established between the ANS/NSFNET
     backbone and Network Service Providers at two NAPs.  At the PacBell
     NAP, ANS/NSFNET is peering with MCInet; at the Sprint NAP,
     ANS/NSFNET is peering with SprintLink.

     Two regionals, MOREnet and THEnet, have completed their transition
     from the NSFNET backbone service, and are obtaining interregional
     Internet service from SprintLink.  These cutovers did not result in
     any downsizing of the NSFNET backbone service; all of the ENSS's on
     the backbone are still in place.

     Due to numerous dependencies, some technical and some
     administrative, other regionals that had planned to move their
     primary Internet connection off the NSFNET backbone by the end of
     November have delayed their changeover, and now plan to make the
     transition in December.

     On behalf of the NSFNET Backbone Service Project, Elise Gerich gave
     presentations about the NSFNET transition at a MIDnet seminar
     titled "A Practical Guide to Secure Internet Connections" and at
     the NorthWestNet Eighth Annual Meeting.  The NorthWestNet meeting
     also included a presentation by Gerich on the Policy Routing
     Database --> RADB transition.   In addition, Jessica Yu attended
     the CoREN technical meetings this month on behalf of the RA
     Project.

NORTHWESTNET
------------

     Eighth Annual Meeting Nov. 8-10
     ===============================

     Has it really been eight years?? Indeed it has. From 15 attendees
     in San Diego in 1986 to over 280 persons attending this year's
     NorthWestNet Annual Meeting in Portland, Oregon, the audience, the
     interest, and the topics (not to mention the Internet) have all
     grown. Participants took every opportunity to learn, share, debate,
     and speculate.

     The major themes addressed by the plenary speakers (see below)
     included the NSFNET transition; programs/projects that are
     leveraging the increased commercial presence on the Internet with
     its introduction to the public sector at large; and several views
     from different levels of government on how to move the National
     Information Infrastructure forward.

       (Don Retallack, Advanced Computing Technologist at Boeing
       Computer Services);
     o K-12 and the Internet (panel moderated by Kristin Boden-MacKay
       from the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory);
     o electronic media's hidden liabilities from a legal viewpoint
       (Joan Feldman, President of Computer Forensics, Inc);

     Everyone got a chance to flex their Internet brain cells, when
     three randomly selected teams of four persons competed in the first
     annual NorthWestNet Internet Quiz Show. Questions that stumped all
     three teams were opened to the audience. All team members and
     audience participants received ample rewards of chocolate. The
     teams--NetEscapers, IFF, and NetNerds--were all excellent, earnest,
     and good-natured competitors.

     The Tuesday night social event offered refuge from the rain and
     escape from the hotel. The Oregon Historical Society and Cisco
     Systems Inc. sponsored food and drink in the engaging surroundings
     of the Oregon History Museum. Thanks to both our sponsors!

     Peter Kirstein attended the ICB meeting at DRA Malvern, in the UK.
     ICB Infrastructure, DSI activities, possible use of ATM and the
     possibility of collaboration udner the European ACTS and Framework
     IV program in general were discussed.

     A UDP based secrure login protocol has been developed in line with
     ALF principles for the HIPPARCH project. This is the third in a
     line of new cut-through application/protocol systems, following a
     video decoder and a shared network text editor, to be designed and

     implem,ented. Lessons from these will be presented at the HIPPARCH
     workshop at INRIA in December.

     IP Multicast over ATM is being tested between UCL, Edinburgh and
     Cambridge with a view to moving the UK mbone over to a colection of
     routers with point-multipoint PVCs between them to get higher
     bandwidth and more efficient transmssion capacity utilisation at
     the same time. Early testing is promising, but fraight with
     configuration complexity! There are high hopes to extends this
     testbed on into Europe in January.
