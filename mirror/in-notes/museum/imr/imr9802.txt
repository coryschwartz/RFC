INTERNET MONTHLY REPORTS
------------------------

The purpose of these reports is to communicate to the Internet Research
Group the accomplishments, milestones reached, or problems discovered by
the participating organizations.

Each organization is expected to submit a 1/2 page report on the first
business day of the month describing the previous month's activities.
These reports should be submitted via network mail to "IMR-ED@ISI.EDU".

`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

The Internet Monthly Report mailing list is now managed by MajorDomo at
ISI.EDU.  The announcements of new issues on the Internet Monthly Report
are sent to the IETF-Announce list and to this IMR list.

Requests to be ADDED or DELETED from the Internet Monthly report list
should be sent to "majordomo@isi.edu" with the message body either
"subscribe imr" or "unsubscribe imr".

Details on obtaining the current IMR, or back issues, via FTP or EMAIL
may be obtained by sending an EMAIL message to "rfc-info@ISI.EDU" with
the message body "help: ways_to_get_imrs".  For example:

        To: rfc-info@ISI.EDU
        Subject: getting imrs

     INTERNIC DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES

     The Netfind seed database for February contained over 2.95 million
     entries.

     InterNIC Directory and Database Services has been one of the main
     repositories for RFCs and Internet Drafts.  We want to minimize the
     problems that will likely occur when we shut down.  We are working
     with the IETF Secretariat and the RFC Editor to smooth the
     transition.

     Since the InterNIC Directory and Database Services project will end
     at the end of March, we have stopped taking new entries for our
     Directory of Directories.  Only InterNIC Directory and Database
     Services will end at that time; InterNIC Registration Services will
     continue operation.

     THE US DOMAIN REGISTRY

     The US Domain registration form is now available online at
     http://www.isi.edu/us-domain.

     Much of the processing of the requests to the third level domain
     name is now automated. In particular, most requests to register
     names in localities already delegated are automatically forwarded
     to the administrator of that locality.

MERIT INTERNET ENGINEERING
--------------------------

     This report summarizes February 1998 activities of Merit's Internet
     Engineering group on behalf of the Routing Arbiter (RA) service and
     other projects.

     A new release of MRT (1.4.4A) provides significant improvements in
     stability and features over earlier releases.  PostScript and PDF
     user/programmer documentation has also been added.  Highlights of
     this release include:

       -  MRTd:  a BGP4+, RIPng, and BGP4 routing daemon. The MRT code
          is now stable and in "production" use as the 6bone routing
          software at a number of sites. MRT supports Cisco Systems-
          style configuration files with access-lists, route maps, and a
          telnet command/configuration interface.
       -  BGPSim: a BGP4/BGP4+ traffic generation and simulation tool.
       -  SBGP: a lightweight BGP4 tool for injecting packets and
          monitoring BGP4  traffic.
       -  Route_BtoA/Route_AtoB: tools for building and decoding
          protocol (BGP4, BGP4+, RIPng, RIP2) packets.

     More information and documentation is available from:

       http://www.merit.edu/~mrt/mrt_docs

     The software is available at:

       ftp://ftp.merit.edu/net-research/mrt/mrt.tar.gz

     Binaries for most major Unix platforms are available at:

       ftp://ftp.merit.edu/net-research/mrt/mrt-1.4.3a-<os>.tar.gz

     Primary MRT development work is carried out at Merit by Craig
     Labovitz and Masaki Hirabaru.  We welcome questions, comments, and
     bug reports for the new version; please send e-mail to mrt-
     support@merit.edu.  Many thanks to those of you who have
     contributed code, suggestions, and bug fixes to MRT!

     The Internet Performance Measurement and Analysis project has
     released a new Java query tool for the Internet Routing Registry:

Ramos                                                          [Page 22]

Internet Monthly Report                                    February 1998


     To use the tool, fill in the text box with a specified query and
     click 'submit'. The tool will return all matching objects. Many of
     the objects returned will include hyperlinks to related objects.
     For example, a Route object will include links to the corresponding
     Maintainer and Aut-num objects.

     The tool also provides editing and submission features. If you
     click on an object with the right mouse button, the tool will bring
     up a text editor.

     Craig Labovitz gave a presentation titled "Use of Multiprotocol
     IPv6 in MRT" at the Second TRAIL (Testbed Routers for Advanced
     Internet Labs) Workshop on IPng Research.  TRAIL is an  NSF
     Networking and Computing Research and Infrastructure (NCRI)
     program.  The conference was sponsored by NSF and USC/ISI East.

     Masaki Hirabaru gave a presentation titled "Internet Routing
     Exchange" at the Internet Technology Research Committee, an
     industry-academia collaborative program of the Japan Society for
     the Promotion of Science.  The talk detailed the background and
     current status of several Internet Engineering activities at Merit,
     including MRT, the Routing Arbiter project (www.merit.edu/radb/),
     Route Server Next Generation (www.rsng.net), and the Internet
     Performance Measurement and Analysis project (www.merit.edu/ipma/).

     iHighway hosted the 12th North American Network Operators' Group
     (NANOG) meeting in Albuquerque on February 8-10.  Stan Barber of
     Academ Consulting Services has kindly made available a complete set
     of notes and slides from the meeting; they will soon be available
     through the NANOG Web site (www.nanog.org).  Bill Norton of Merit
     moderated the meeting and Susan Rebecca Harris planned the agenda.

     Main area of improvement is our windows proting work of the Mbone
     tools

     Through careful examination of the lower level middleware, we've
     realised a 23 fold improvement in the video tool performance by
     removing 1 line of code which caused all partial video window
     updates to actualyl do full update.

     This now means wqe can do 30 FPS at full VGA display on a 133MHz
     pentium and not use all bus and CPU, so that audio tools do not
     suffer interference.

     * New RFCs added to queue throughout the month

     The Requests for Comments (RFCs) are a series of notes, started in
     1969, about the Internet (originally the ARPANET). The notes
     discuss many aspects of computing and computer communication
     focusing in networking protocols, procedures, programs, and
     concepts, but also including meeting notes, opinion, and sometimes
     humor. The specification documents of the Internet protocol suite,
     as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and its
     steering group (the IESG), are published as RFCs.

     RFCs-to-be are edited by the RFC Editor.  RFCs enter the RFC
     Editor's work queue either by an action of the IESG or by
     independent submission.  Most independent submissions are referred
     to the IESG to check for overlap with IETF work.  The IESG might
     put a hold on a document to gather more input from its members.
     The wait for an RFC to be published varies as there can be
     unforeseen complications (typically editorial matters that need
     clarification from the author).  Documents can be removed from the
     publication queue if they are found to be insufficient or incorrect
     or if the IESG asks the author to join work already in progress in
     the IETF.
