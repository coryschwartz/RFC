INTERNET ENGINEERING REPORTS
----------------------------

              IETF Monthly Report for August, 1996

     1. The IETF met in Montreal, Quebec, Canada from June 24-28, 1996.
     It was another record setter as over 1200 attendees registered.
     Much of this was probably due to the IETF meeting along side INET
     '96.

     The IETF returns to San Jose, California on December 9-13, 1996.
     Our local host will be cisco Systems. The Secretariat will open for
     registrations the first part of October. The IETF opens 1997
     Memphis, Tennessee where Federal Express will be the host.  This
     meeting will be held April 7-11, 1997. Following Memphis, the IETF
     is we returning to Europe and will met in Munich, Germany August
     11-15, 1997, hosted by Digi/ISOC.DE. The Secretariat is still
     working on the final meeting of 1997.

     Once all the arrangements have been made, notifications will be
     sent to the IETF Announcement list. Remember that information on
     future IETF meetings can be always be found in the file 0mtg-
     sites.txt which is located on the IETF shadow directories.  This
     information can also be viewed from the IETF Home Page on the Web.
     The URL is:

                             http://www.ietf.org

     2. The minutes of the IESG teleconferences have been publicly
     available on the IETF Shadow directories since 1991. These files
     are placed in the /ftp/iesg directory.

     The following IESG minutes have been added:

           July 25, 1996 (iesg.96-07-25)
           August 8, 1996 (iesg.96-08-08)

INTERNIC
--------

     REGISTRATION SERVICES

     The following report covers the months of July, August, and
     September:


     I.  Significant Events

     * HostReg and CReg templates are now being processed automatically;
     previously they had to be processed manually; now about 50% are
     being processed automatically.

     * The auto-registration software now sorts requests into six
     groups:  (1) COM, (2) ORG, (3) NET, (4) GOV, (5) EDU and (6) TLD;
     this eliminates a manual step in the process and allows the ability
     to put an increased priority on GOV, EDU and TLD requests.

     * Plans to initiate a night shift are under development to assist
     in reducing the manual processing backlog.

     * Informal training was provided for Billing CSRs regarding how to
     register as a contact.

     * Selection and training of a second shift for processing support
     was completed; a full day training class was held on Saturday,
     September 10th; final staffing arrangements were completed for a
     night shift with a start date of September 30th.

     * A "SWAT Team" of existing staff was used to reduce the backlog.

     * Fax processing has become an overwhelming problem, requiring over
     four full-time equivalent employees.

     * Duane Stone and Carley Johnson represented the InterNIC DomReg
     Section at Network World Interop.

     * Testing of a share-ware Fax Server solution is going very well;
     it would make faxes available as e-mail; the fax viewer works very
     well on Sparc 5s and also supports sending faxes out; the MTS and
     Ack/Nak interfaces still need to be completed.

Internet Monthly Report                                      August 1996


     * DomReg software enhancements have reduced the number of requests
     that need to be processed manually from about 1,000 to 700 (30%
     improvement).

     * A method for gathering performance measurements was finalized and
     documented.

     INTERNIC DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES

     InterNIC Directory and Database Services is now the "official"
     source for the Netfind seed database and the Netfind source code.
     The seed database is updated monthly and is available at:

                http://ds.internic.net/wp/netfind-seeddb.html

     The Netfind source code is available at:

                 http://ds.internic.net/wp/netfind-src.html

     The latest version is 5.0.1.

     The netfind code comes with version 1.60 beta5 of MIT's pthreads
     for building pthread support if pthreads are not native. GNU make
     and gcc (both available from the GNU software FTP archive) are
     necessary to build MIT's pthreads.

     Netfind 5.0.1 is not currently backward compatible with SunOS 4.*
     and lightweight process threads (LWP). For those still wishing to

THE US DOMAIN REGISTRY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     The US Domain now has an online line registration form.

     Some of the processing of the requests to the third level domain
     name is now automated. In particular, most requests to register
     names in localities already delegated are automatically forwarded
     to the administrator for that locality.

     The US Domain administrator no longer makes direct registrations of
     hosts, and only makes delegations of third or fourth level domain
     names (such as localities).

     A new policy has been added to the criteria for delegating domain
     names under the US Domain:

         It is the intention that the delegation of third level (for
         example, locality) domain names be wide spread to many
         registries.  It is undesirable for one person or organization
         to manage a large part of the third level names in any
         particular geographic or logical area.

         No individual or organization shall have more than 500
         delegations total in the US Domain as a whole, or more than 50
         delegation in any particuilar second level (for example, a
         state).

     About the special domains under the state codes.

         The K12, CC, TEC, LIB, STATE, DST, COG and GEN domain under
         each state are established for special purposes (see RFC 1480).




IMR Editor                                                     [Page 15]

Internet Monthly Report                                      August 1996


         In addition to the constaint to use them only for the defined
         purpose, each of these special domains is also to delegated
         only to a manager within the state, and the operation of the
         delegated registry should be non-profit.

         The LIB domain should be managed by a govermental or
         educational library organization.

         Further, it is most appropriate for the K12, CC, and TEC,
         domains to be managed by an educational organization (for
         example, a university or a department of education).

         The STATE domain is most appropriately managed by an agency of
         the state government.  DST and COG should be managed by a
         goverment agency.

         The GEN domain may be delegated to any organization that will
         provide the registration service for free (and remember the
         purpose of the GEN domain is to register statewide non-profit
         organizations).

     To obtain a copy of the list of other delegated localities and
     subdomains not administered by the US Domain Registrar, get the
     file "us-domain-delegated.txt".

MERIT INTERNET ENGINEERING
--------------------------

     This report summarizes August 1996 activities of Merit's Internet
     Engineering group on behalf of the Routing Arbiter (RA) service and
     other projects.

     An incremental update client has recently been implemented for the
     Routing Arbiter Database by Jerry Winters of the RADB staff.  The
     new client polls the RIPE registry's mirroring site every 30
     minutes for database updates; previously, updates were only
     provided once each day.  The technology thus significantly improves
     the timeliness of the Internet Routing Registry (IRR) data provided
     by RAWhoisd, the whois.ra.net whois server.  Winters has been
     testing a server that will allow Merit to support its own database
     mirroring site, much like RIPE's.  This would mean that other IRR
     organizations, such as MCI, CA*net, and RIPE, could update their
     database copies with new RADB data as frequently as every five
     minutes, rather than every 24 hours.  The Merit mirroring site
     would also support a hot backup system for the production RADB
     database system.

     As part of Merit's ongoing research on routing technologies and
     protocols, IPv6 routing support has been added to the Multi-
     Threaded Routing Toolkit (MRT).  The development work is being
     carried out by Masaki Hirabaru, an Associate Professor of
     Information Science at Japan's Nara Institute of Science and
     Technology, who is working at Merit for part of the 1996 academic
     year.  Hirabaru is developing a wide-area IPv6 testing environment
     for MRT using the 6bone, a virtual network that links sites in
     North America, Europe, and Japan.  The 6bone is layered on top of
     portions of the physical, IPv4-based Internet to support routing of
     IPv6 packets, as that function has not yet been integrated into

     many production routers.  The 6bone comprises islands of IPv6 hosts
     connected by virtual point-to-point links, called tunnels.  The
     tunnel endpoints are typically workstation-class machines with
     operating system support for IPv6.  Support for RIPng and the IPv6
     policy language has also been implemented in MRT, including
     implementation of IPv6 access-lists and router descriptions.  In
     addition, Hirabaru and MRT developer Craig Labovitz have been
     working with IPv6 operating system development groups to fix
     several bugs in the IPv6 kernel software.
