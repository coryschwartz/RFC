INTERNET MONTHLY REPORTS
------------------------

The purpose of these reports is to communicate to the Internet Research
Group the accomplishments, milestones reached, or problems discovered by
the participating organizations.

Each organization is expected to submit a 1/2 page report on the first
business day of the month describing the previous month's activities.
These reports should be submitted via network mail to "IMR-ED@ISI.EDU".

`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

The Internet Monthly Report mailing list is now managed by MajorDomo at
ISI.EDU.  The announcements of new issues on the Internet Monthly Report
are sent to the IETF-Announce list and to this IMR list.

Requests to be ADDED or DELETED from the Internet Monthly report list
should be sent to "majordomo@isi.edu" with the message body either
"subscribe imr" or "unsubscribe imr".

Details on obtaining the current IMR, or back issues, via FTP or EMAIL
may be obtained by sending an EMAIL message to "rfc-info@ISI.EDU" with
the message body "help: ways_to_get_imrs".  For example:

        To: rfc-info@ISI.EDU

     The Netfind seed database for October contained 2.1 million
     entries.

     In October we also updated some of our software, including an
     upgrade of Harvest to version 1.5.  This new version supports HTTP
     v1.1 and allows us to index additional sites.

     The Academic Guide has also been updated.

     A reminder - if you would like to help the Internet community find
     a resource that you offer, send mail to admin@ds.internic.net and
     we will send information about listing your resource in the
     Directory of Directories.  If you prefer, you can enter information
     about your resource in our WWW suggestion form.  The form can be

     THE US DOMAIN REGISTRY

     THE US DOMAIN
     =============

     The US Domain registration form is now available online at
     http://www.isi.edu/us-domain.

     The US Domain has the maps of all the delegated special domains
     online at http://www.isi.edu/us-domain.

     Some of the processing of the requests to the third level domain
     name is now automated. In particular, most requests to register
     names in localities already delegated are automatically forwarded
     to the administrator of that locality.

     Recent announcements:

     1. A new policy has been added to avoid several cases of
     misleading, erroneous, and outright false information provided on
     registration applications.

     One situation that occurs is that one individual represents himself
     as several distinct companies in order to bypass some limitations
     on the number of delegations allowed (e.g., the 50/500 rule).

     Another situation is that with the requirement to provide a
     government employee as the administrative contact for a locality
     delegation.  Some applications have been received with a government
     employee's contact information but that person has no idea that
     such an application has been submitted.  Some applications provide
     contact information for an individual that knows what is going on
     but is not an employee of the locality government.  Still other
     applications have been received where the administrative contact
     information is fictional.

     The US Domain Administration may choose to verify any or all of the
     information on registration applications (including the
     administrative contact) and if it is determined that the an
     application contains false of substantially misleading information
     that application may be denied, or if already acted on the
     delegation may be revoked, and in either case all other delegations
     made to the party submitting the false or misleading application
     may also be revoked.







Ramos                                                          [Page 17]

     2. For delegations made after 1-Jul-97, it is assumed by the US
     Domain Administrator that every applicant for the delegation (or
     redelegation) of a locality name has the written agreement of the
     legitimate government for that locality for the applicant to manage
     the domain name of that locality.

     Evidience of such an agreement does not need to be presented at the
     time of delegation (except that the administrative contact on the
     application template must be the government representative).
     However, if the delegation is later challenged or contested, the
     manager of the locality domain must produce the agreement.  Failure
     to do so will most likely result in the transfer of the management
     of the locality domain to another manager that does have such an
     agreement.

     If there is a dispute as to what is the legitimate government for a
     locality is and who may act for it, the league of cities or
     association of municipalities that each state (as recognized by the
     National League of Cities) may be asked to assist in resolving such
     disputes.

     In some places there are overlapping jurisdictions with the same
     name (for example, the city of Los Angeles and the county of Los
     Angeles).  In such cases, the higher level government should have
     priority.  A new policy has been added regarding the charges for
     the domain name passed on during delegation.  The administrator of
     the locality has to notify one year in advance before charging for
     those domains.

MERIT INTERNET ENGINEERING
--------------------------

     This report summarizes October 1997 activities of Merit's Internet
     Engineering group on behalf of the Routing Arbiter (RA) service and
     other projects.

     We are pleased to announce that Merit has received a $1.6 million
     award from the National Science Foundation in support of the
     Internet Performance Measurement and Analysis project, or IPMA.
     The project is a joint effort between Merit and the Department of
     Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of
     Michigans College of Engineering.

     IPMA focuses on two primary areas of Internet statistics: routing
     stability, topology, and visualization; and provider performance
     measurements. The IPMA tools will be easily configurable, so that
     users can quickly generate exactly the kinds of network performance
     data they need.  The overall goal of the project is to develop
     tools and perform statistical research that promotes the stability
     and rational growth of the Internet.

     The IPMA project works closely with the Cooperative Association for
     Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA) and the National Laboratory for
     Applied Network Research (NLANR) to create a shared measurement
     infrastructure for the U.S. Internet.  The directors of the project
     are Craig Labovitz of Merit and Associate Professor Farnam Jahanian
     of the U-M Department of EECS.  The IPMA home page can be found at
     http://www.merit.edu/ipma.

     New data from the PAIR (Policy Analysis of Internet Routing)
     project greatly improves capabilities for network analysis and
     troubleshooting by organizations peering with the Route Servers
     (RS).  For each peer, the data shows:

       -  What routes the peer is importing and exporting via the RSs
          from each of its peers

       -  Whether each of those routes is RED (registered in the
          Internet Routing Registry but not currently announced by the
          Route Servers), GREEN (registered in the IRR and announced by
          the Route Servers), or GREY (announced to the Route Servers
          but not redistributed by the RSs.  GREY routes do not match
          prescribed policy in the IRR.)

     The data is available on the Route Server Next Generation projects
     Web pages:

     The CAIRN network has operated well, and discussions are underway
     with BT on connecting our LEARNET network to the CAIRN - see
     http://www.cs.uclac.uk/staff/jon/pearl/
     for some information on this UK network.

     We have written a paper on pricing for differential services using
     a modified TCP - this was submitted to a journal, but was given as
     an Mbone semnar to Berkeley and at BT labs recently - see:
     http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/p.oechslin/multcp_draft.ps

     We have had a paper accepted to INFOCOM 98 on our reliable
     multicast congestion control work. This was made available to the
     IRTF's RM community at their last meeting, and pointers were sent
     on that groups maillist. The scheme is undergoing tests on the
     CAIRN with layered video between UCL and SAIC.

     * New RFCs added to queue throughout the month

     Processed documents include those that are "Do Not Publish" as well
     as published RFCs.  This month RFC(s) were published that had
     previously been "Do Not Publish".  For this reason the "Beginning
     of Month" numbers, for RFCs that have been in the queue for 30, 60
     and 90 days, may not be the same numbers as the "End of Month"
     numbers from last month.  Documents added back to the queue
     include:

             90 Days
                     draft-rfced-info-faith-02.txt

     The Requests for Comments (RFCs) are a series of notes, started in
     1969, about the Internet (originally the ARPANET). The notes
     discuss many aspects of computing and computer communication
     focusing in networking protocols, procedures, programs, and
     concepts, but also including meeting notes, opinion, and sometimes
     humor. The specification documents of the Internet protocol suite,
     as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and its
     steering group (the IESG), are published as RFCs.

     RFCs-to-be are edited by the RFC Editor.  RFCs enter the RFC
     Editor's work queue either by an action of the IESG or by
     independent submission.  Most independent submissions are referred
     to the IESG to check for overlap with IETF work.  The IESG might
     put a hold on a document to gather more input from its members.
     The wait for an RFC to be published varies as there can be
     unforeseen complications (typically editorial matters that need
     clarification from the author).  Documents can be removed from the
     publication queue if they are found to be insufficient or incorrect
     or if the IESG asks the author to join work already in progress in
     the IETF.
