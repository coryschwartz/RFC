IAB MESSAGE

     A. IAB/IETF ORGANIZATIONAL ISSUES

     Given recent extensive discussions about how the IAB and IETF
     interact on standards-matters, it would be helpful to hold a more
     structured discussion of the issues, with the aim of improving the
     effectiveness of the organization for the benefit of the overall
     Internet community.  The IAB would like to work with the IESG,
     IETF, IRTF and ISOC to identify and evaluate various possibilities
     and to report any recommendations to the Internet Society Board of
     Trustees for incorporation in the IAB Charter.

     B. STANDARDS ACTIONS

       The following list shows the protocol standards actions approved
       by the IAB during the month of July 1992.

       o Multiprotocol Interconnect on X.25 and ISDN in the Packet Mode
           Proposed Standard:  July 1992
                RFC-1356 "Multiprotocol Interconnect on X.25 and ISDN
                    in the Packet Mode"

       o RIP -- Routing Information Protocol
           Proposed Standard:  July 1992
                RFC-1058 "Routing Information Protocol"

     C. RFC'S PUBLISHED IN JULY FOR PREVIOUSLY-ANNOUNCED ACTIONS

       o STD 33: TFTP -- Trivial File Transfer Protocol
           Internet Standard:  July 1992
                RFC-1350, "The TFTP Protocol (Revision 2)"

     D. IAB STANDARDS ACTIONS PENDING ON AUGUST 1, 1992

        'PPP Authentication Protocols' to Proposed Standard
             Awaiting final WG revisions

        'IDPR' to Proposed Standard
             Under consideration by the IAB.

     1. The Boston IETF meeting, held July 12-17, was "well attended"
        in that there were over 680 meeting attendees. Special thanks
        go to Chuck Davin and Jeff Schiller of MIT, and John Curran of
        NEARnet for the amazing work they did hosting the meeting,
        providing the terminal room, and for organizing the social event,
        and to the Hyatt Regency Staff.

        As was the case in San Diego, this IETF meeting enjoyed some
        "firsts." This meeting broke the 600 attendee mark as there were
        over 680 attendees.

        Following up on their successful efforts in San Diego, Steve
        Casner, Steve Deering, and a host of others joinged together
        and provided both an audio AND video broadcast of the technical
        presentations and open plenaries. There were 92 sites receiving
        audio broadcasts, and 45 sites that also received the video
        broadcast. The receivers of the audio/video broadcasts were
        spread over 11 different countries!

     2. The next IETF is scheduled for November 16-20, 1992 in
        Washington, DC.  Our local host is U.S. Sprint. The Spring

BOLT BERANEK AND NEWMAN INC.

     INTER DOMAIN POLICY ROUTING

     During the month of July, we have been assessing the set of
     tasks to be completed for IDPR version 1.  These include:

     (1) Updating the MIB Internet Draft;
     (2) Updating the configuration and usage document;
     (3) Implementing the MIB;
     (4) Getting the required changes officially placed in the DNS;
     (5) Bringing the gated version of IDPR in line with the protocol
         specification.

     We are working on tasks (2) and (4).  At the July IETF, other members
     of the IDPR Working Group volunteered to work on tasks (1), (3), (4),
     and (5).

     We are still planning on an Internet pilot of IDPR for late summer or
     early fall.  Those interested in obtaining a copy of the IDPR gated
     software, please contact Woody Woodburn (woody@sparta.com).

     TWBNet

     During July, we fielded a new WPS release (v11.3).  Throughout the
     month, the network has been stable and working well with this new
     software.  In addition to some bug fixes and some enhancements in
     measurement and reporting of Butterfly clock speeds, the monitoring
     and system, the following new features have been added:

     1. RAM card support -- This provides support for:

        + Faster rebooting -- All of the WPSen in TWBNET will be, or
          have already been, upgraded to have a Multibus card cage
          and a 1.5MB battery-backed RAM card.  This is enough
          memory to store all of the WPS application software plus
          the operating system Chrysalis plus several debugging tools
          and symbol tables, and still have lots of space left.  By
          storing the software on the RAM card, the time needed to
          reboot the WPS drops by 80% -- from about 35 minutes to
          around 7 minutes.

        + Improved crash cause analysis -- When a WPS crashes, it will,
          if possible, write out "what was on the console screen" to



Cooper                                                         [Page 10]

Internet Monthly Report                                        July 1992


          a file on the RAM card.  (Each crash writes to a different
          filename.)  New monitoring and control commands have been
          developed to permit these files to be uploaded to the NOC for
          study, and to make it easy to selectively delete these files.

        + Retention of configuration and parameter information updates

          In previous versions of the software, there was no convenient
          way to save configuration or parameter changes and restore
          them after a complete reboot.  In v11.3, the RAM card is used
          to save and restore configuration and parameter information,
          eliminating the need for frequent WPS config file change and
          distribution.

     2. Large-WPS support

        An aspect of recent WPS upgrades is that the WPSen are being
        converted from 2-column Butterfly machines (which support 1-16
        processors) to 4-column Butterfly machines (which can support
        64 processors) to allow expansion in the number of gateways
        that can be attached from 7 (today) to 20 or so.  This
        software release includes table size increases needed to
        support the larger number of gateways and the larger number
        of processor nodes.

     3. Builtin (static) group address tables increased

        Previous releases have supported only three builtin groups,
        with at most 10 members each.  Release 11.3 supports seven
        builtin groups, with at most 30 members each.

        A "builtin" or "static" group is a HAP multicast address
        whose member list is constant (they're specified in the WPS
        config file). Currently, builtin groups are used to support
        the Conferencing and SIMNET applications where multicasting
        of packets is valuable.  The distinction between "builtin
        groups" and "dynamic groups" (which will be in a future
        release) is that dynamic group addresses are allocated and
        freed using HAP Setup Request commands, and members join
        and leave the group as they wish, whereas static groups map
        specific HAP addresses into a fixed membership list.

     4. Better stream and priority datagram service

        Part of providing good service to stream and high-priority
        datagram traffic is making sure that a high priority packet
        gets sent reasonably quickly even if it arrives after a group
        of lower priority packets.  This means that, even when there's



Cooper                                                         [Page 11]

Internet Monthly Report                                        July 1992


        no high priority traffic to send at all, the device driver
        output queues can't be allowed to fill up with too much lower
        priority traffic.

        In order to limit the maximum delay a late-arriving high
        priority packet would suffer, line rate sensing has been
        implemented in this release.  The HAP interface measures
        the rate at which data is being transmitted and then limits
        the amount of data enqueued to keep the maximum delay below
        a preset threshold.  (The threshold is an adjustable parameter,
        and is currently set for about 200 milliseconds.)

CERFNET
-------

     During July CERFnet made some changes to the management staff.
     Susie Arnold has elected to leave her full-time position with
     CERFnet as manager of operations and enginnering to pursue a new
     career in teaching. Susie will still be available over the network,
     however, at her CERFnet mailing address which is listed below.
     (once a network junkie, it's hard to stop!)

     Pushpendra Mohta will be assuming responsibilities for engineering
     and Dan Matzke will be the manager of NOC operations. Susan Calcari
     remains as manager of network information services.

CSUNET (THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY NETWORK)
-----------------------------------------------

     The California State University network (CSUnet) completed the
     connection of two Mexican universities at 56K DDS: CETYS (Centro de
     Ensenaza Technico Y Superior) and ITM (Instituto Tecnologico de
     Mexicali).  CETYS has three campuses which are being interconnected
     (Tijuana, Mexicali, and Monterrey) for use by engineering students



Cooper                                                         [Page 12]

Internet Monthly Report                                        July 1992


     and faculty.  ITM is involved in MEXnet, a Mexican association
     formed in January, 1991.

         "MEXnet is an association of higher education and research
         institutions of Mexico.  The meaning of MEXnet is Mexican
         Telecommunications Network for Higher Education and Research
         Institutions (Red Mexicana de Telecomunicaciones para
         Instituciones Academicas y de Investigacion).

         And getting in mind that this is the time where the
         technology development depends on the Computer Networking
         of each educating institution. MEXnet is looking for the
         Data Bases, the BBS, the information stored in most of the
         computers around the world must be in the hands of every
         Mexican institution. ..."

     Also, in July, CSUnet connected the first two of the ten LATA
     connections to the Pacific*Bell Knowledge Network (the Pacific*Bell
     K-14 Educational Networking Project).

     These T-1 TCP/IP connections are in support of the cooperative
     agreement between the Trustees of the California State University
     and the Pacific*Bell Knowledge Network Project.

     The first two connects are to the Hayward and Anaheim central
     offices.  At each CO, Pacific*Bell has a Cisco AGS+ router.  Cisco
     uses the CO's as hubs for the Knowledge Network.  The Ciscos are
     the center of a star topology that connects NAT (Network
     Applications Tecnologies) routers to the Cisco network.
     Pacific*Bell also uses Proteon routers internally.

     Some concerns that have been addressed including responsible use of
     the IP addressing space, naming issues for the K-14 community, and
     fees by CSUnet's neighboring regional networks for advertisement of
     the IP numbers to the NSFNET.

     Pacific*Bell and CSUnet decided to use a Class B network
     partitioned which a standard 8-bit subnet mask.  This mask is
     solely for the trial period.  The idea being that each high school,
     community college, etc, will be alloted a subnet of its own and if
     need be, additional subnets.  Pacific*Bell expects to change to a
     larger subnet mask to conserve addressing space.  Since
     Pacific*Bell provides this the TCP/IP service for a fee, efforts
     continue for an attractive low-cost offering to K-14 users.

FARNET (FEDERATION OF AMERICAN RESEARCH NETWORKS)
-------------------------------------------------

     (May, June and July 1992)

     FARNET has three new members: Sprint (Full Member), Wiltel
     (Associate Member), and MOREnet (Associate Member).

     In May 1992 FARNET held a quarterly membership meeting at the
     Microelectronics Center of North Carolina, hosted by CONCERT
     Network.  The theme of the meeting was "Business and Strategic
     Planning for Your Organization".  Attendees learned a set of
     techniques for evaluating the "stage" of maturity which a business
     or industry has reached and a set of questions for planning the
     future of your organization.

     In June several FARNET members attended the INET92 conference in
     Kobe, Japan.  Presenting papers or chairing sessions at the meeting
     were: Elise Gerich, MERIT (Internet connectivity issues); Phill
     Gross, ANS (routing and adddressing working group presentation);
     Sergio Heker, JvNCnet (a practical approach to network connectivity
     problems); Martyne Hallgren, Cornell (dynamics of electronic
     collaboration); Richard Mandelbaum, NYSERNet (chair of panel on the
     future of the Internet); Laura Breeden, FARNET (chair of North
     American regional session); Glenn Ricart, SURAnet (North American
     regional session); Al Weis, ANS (commercial networks as related to
     research and education networks).  More than 550 people
     representing 70 countries attended the conference.

     In July FARNET sponsored a workshop with NSF support to analyze and
     provide commentary on the Draft NSF Solicitation for the Routing
     Authority/NAP Manager and vBNS Provider.  Results of this workshop
     are available via ftp from host farnet.org, in directory
     farnet_docs, filenames iinren*.  Key recommendations included: NSF
     should reaffirm its historical commitment to providing broad
     support for research and educational networking; transition
     planning should be carried out well in advance of any changes and
     should include representatives of the provider community; and the
     functions of the NAP Manager and Routing Authority should be
     decoupled.

     Also in July FARNET hosted a workshop for regional laboratory
     directors from the US Department of Education's Office of
     Educational Research and Improvement (OERI) and FARNET members.
     This event brought representatives from nine of the 10 regional
     labs together with FARNET member representatives from across the
     country, and included staff from the National Science Foundation
     (DNCRI and Education and Human Resources/Application of Advanced

     Technology divisions) and the Department of Education (OERI).  The
     foundation was laid for productive partnerships at the state and
     regional level between the two sets of regional organizations.

     Susan Calcari of CERFnet represented FARNET at the ESNET Steering
     Committee meeting in Santa Fe, NM on July 15-16, where she made a
     presentation about Internet user services and their evolution.
     Thanks, Susan!

     FARNET hosted a BOF at the Cambridge IETF meeting to report on
     preliminary results of its meeting to discuss the NSF Draft
     Solicitation.

     In August, FARNET's regular quarterly meeting will focus on new
     technologies, with talks by a range of vendors on topics from
     network management software to routing technologies.

     GIGABIT NETWORKING

     ATOMIC

     The ATOMIC project at USC/ISI installed its first Mosaic-based 3-
     by-3 mesh router board, measuring approximately 8 inches by 9
     inches.  This router may be configured as either a 6-by-6 perfect
     crossbar or a 12-by-12 blocking crossbar.

     Six ATOMIC LAN host interfaces were attached to that router.  That
     configuration achieved a combined throughput of 1.3 Gb/s across the
     router, a figure approximately 1/3 of the expected 4 Gb/s capacity.
     We are unable to generate more than 1.3 Gb/s of host packet traffic
     currently and so cannot test this small-scale router to saturation.

     The full-scale ATOMIC router is a same-size board configured as a
     16-by-16 perfect crossbar or 32-by-32 blocking crossbar.  Samples
     exist.  These are undergoing fabrication testing and as routers are
     expected to achieve 10 Gb/s.

     MULTIMEDIA CONFERENCING

     At the July IETF in Boston, Internet teleconferencing continued to
     break new ground!  This time, both packet audio AND video were
     "mediacast" to participants spanning 170 different hosts and 10
     different countries (AU, CA, CH, FR, JP, NL, NO, SE, UK, US).  The
     configuration supported widescale listening and viewing of not only
     the general sessions, but also working groups pertaining to
     Audio/Video Transport, Teleconferencing Architecture, and IP
     Multicast.  The DARTnet served as the multicast backbone with
     tunnels branching out over T3 backbone, lightly-loaded T1's and
     Ethernets.  We are now coordinating the construction of the MBONE,
     the multicast backbone, to expose IP multicasting to scaling
     problems of 1 to 2 orders of magnitude.

     In the AVT WG, Steve Casner presented and led discussion on the
     second iteration of a strawman for a real-time transport protocol.
     In the Telearch BOF, Eve Schooler gave a presentation about the
     Control Control Protocol (CCP) for flexible n-way session
     orchestration.  The hope is that IETF efforts in these areas will
     lead to broader solutions for telecollaboration across the
     Internet.

     Working with students at USC, we integrated software decoding of
     the compressed video used in DARTnet experiments with packet
     reception and X-window display software.  This enables a larger
     number of receivers to participate in DARTnet experiments without
     additional hardware cost, and it facilitates workstation-based
     personal conferencing by eliminating the need for a separate
     monitor on which to display video.

     The implementation of CCP underwent refinements and testing over
     DARTnet this month.

NSFNET/ANSNET BACKBONE ENGINEERING
----------------------------------

     T3 Backbone Status
     ==================

     Traffic migration from the T1 to the T3 backbone is in its final
     stages, with only a few networks on T1 left to be cut over to T3.
     New software is being deployed on the T3 backbone nodes to further
     improve performance and stability. Load-related problems continue
     to occur on the T1 network's Routing Control Processors and are
     being addressed with software changes to improve RCP efficiency.
     Activities for the "Phase IV" upgrade of the T3 backbone are being
     planned including FDDI adapter upgrades and other changes that will
     support dismantling of the T1 backbone later this year.

Internet Monthly Report                                        July 1992


     Traffic Migration and Statistics
     ================================

     In July, 12,884,937,091 packets entered the T3 network, up 20% from
     June.  4,754,950,521 packets entered the T1 network, down 17.5%
     from June. The total for both networks (minus cross-network
     traffic) was 17,063,064,412, up 8.4% from June.

     6130 networks are configured for the T1 backbone, and 5269 for the
     T3 backbone. Actual network announcements by mid-level peer routers
     to the T1 backbone are 4426 networks, and 3508 to the T3. It is
     interesting to note that 1246 of the configured T1 networks were
     never actually announced to the backbone during the month; and 882
     of the configured T3 networks were never announced to the backbone.
     New software has been installed to track the number of announced
     networks over time.

     During July, NorthWestNet, Terrestrial Wideband (TWB) Net, Milnet
     and Minnesota Supercomputer Center (MSC) Net were cut over to the
     T3 backbone. The remainder of the networks for Sprint and
     International Connections Manager (ICM) were cut over in early
     August.

     Networks remaining to be cut over are: ESNet, Mexican Networks (at
     Boulder), EASINet, and CA*Net. The first two are expected in mid-
     August. The EASINet and CA*Net peers are currently only physically
     connected to the T1 backbone and will be moved to allow peering
     with the T3 backbone in early September.

     Improvements to the T3 Backbone
     ===============================

     New Software Build
     ==================

     Version 2.81.31 of the AIX software and microcode has recently been
     deployed on the T3 backbone nodes. This build includes several
     significant fixes to problems and improvements to performance.
     These include: a buffering change to increase performance for T3 to
     ethernet interface transfers, a fix to a condition that causes an
     ethernet interface to freeze, on-card support for additional
     ethernet MIB-II variables, changes to the T3 card microcode, and a
     fix to a bug in ICMP time-stamp processing (now resolves to the
     millisecond).

Internet Monthly Report                                        July 1992


     T3 Routing Software Changes
     ===========================

     Numerous improvements have been made to the T3 routing daemon,
     rcp_routed.  These are described in release notes available for
     anonymous ftp:

         ftp.ans.net:/pub/info/t3-rcp_routed/Release-Notes

     The most significant recent change provides a workaround for
     regionals that generate a default pointing at 140.222 and find
     their ENSS isolated from the rest of 140.222 T3 system due to loss
     of the ENSS link to the CNSS.  Other changes include better
     handling of BGP external metrics, and various reliability and
     operational improvements.

     Routing stability measurements have been made over the last few
     months.  This information, in addition to the detailed logs have
     helped identify routing disturbances, isolate problems involving
     connectivity loss (IS-IS adjacency loss or BGP disconnect) which
     should not have occurred, and correct the problems.  This has
     resulted in a measurable improvement in BGP stability.

     FDDI Interface Upgrade Planned for August
     =========================================

     We are planning to upgrade the existing FDDI interfaces deployed on
     several ENSS nodes to new RS960 technology based interface
     adapters.  Due to the complexity of the May '92 T3 upgrade, and the
     need for operational stability, it was decided not to upgrade the
     older FDDI interfaces at the same time as the T3 network.  Instead,
     it was decided to decouple the process of testing and deployment of
     the new T3 technology from the new FDDI technology.  The FDDI
     interface that is installed at each T3 ENSS location will be
     upgraded from an earlier technology to the newer RS960 adapter
     technology in August '92.  This will raise the peak throughput
     observed by end users well beyond the current 10-14Mbps that may be
     observed today.  Our objective is to continue to incrementally
     improve performance while maintaining very high reliability.

     Once the new FDDI adapters are installed and operational at the
     existing nodes, we will explore installations at other ENSS nodes
     that do not yet support FDDI.

     New SNMP Daemon Installed
     =========================

     A new release of the SNMP software on the T3 backbone was
     installed.  With the deployment of build 2.81.31 and SNMP version
     3.213, in and out octet counts are available for the T960 ethernet
     and T1 cards.  The current MIB variable map for the ethernet, T1
     and T3 interfaces supported by the RS6000 nodes is as follows.

     RS960 T3        |  0    0     IN    OUT    OK     OK     OK    OK  |
     ====================================================================

     The pending operating system upgrade of the RS/6000 routers to AIX
     3.2 will allow for more complete support of the appropriate MIBS
     for each adapter type.

     RS/960 Memory Parity Problem
     ============================

     A manufacturing problem with memory chips on a small number of the
     RS960 T3 interface adapters has been identified and corrected.
     However to protect against recurrence or new introduction of memory
     problems, we are scheduling diagnostics to be run on some nodes
     along with other scheduled maintenance over the next few weeks.

     DSU Synchronization Problem
     ===========================

     A problem was observed in the first few weeks after the April-May
     deployment of RS/960 T3 cards and DSUs, where a T3 DSU would lose
     synchronization with its peer on nodes that connect to the Houston
     POP.  This problem has not been reproducible in our test labs or in
     the T3 Research Network after extensive experimentation, nor has it
     occurred on production nodes since then.

     DSU PROM Upgrade
     ================

     The firmware in the T3 Technologies DSUs will be upgraded to a new
     level, allowing extended remote monitoring capability.  This
     upgrade will be performed in the late August timeframe with plenty
     of advanced notice.

     T1 ENSS Memory Upgrades
     =======================

     Each of the T1 ENSS nodes on the T3 backbone were recently upgraded
     from 16MB -> 32MB of main memory to provide capacity for increased
     paging.

     T1 Backbone Status
     ==================

     A new rcp_routed release was deployed early in July which increased
     the BGP packet size to 4096. This was necessary to allow a full
     complement of networks to be announced from the backbone to
     regional peers (the same change was made to the T3 rcp_routed).

     Later in the month another new rcp_routed version was deployed
     which contained changes to support compression of the IS-IS
     protocol LSP.  This is necessary to allow the T1 network to sustain
     the current limit of 2200 networks being announced in from external
     mid-level peers to a single NSS.

     NSS 11 at Houston exhibited some problems after the Milnet networks
     were cut over to the T3 backbone.  Some mid-level peers announce
     all of the networks learned from the T3 backbone into the T1
     backbone, and these are stored by the T1 node but are marked as
     unusable. This caused the Houston RCP to run out of memory. A
     change was made to the peer routers to prevent these networks from
     being announced to the T1 network, and a future release of the
     rcp_routed will include a change so that these routes are not
     stored.

     T3 Backbone Phase IV Planning
     =============================

     Upgrades to the T3 backbone are being planned to support future
     performance and functional enhancements, and to allow the
     dismantling of the T1 backbone.  The major features of this plan
     include:

     1) T3 ENSS FDDI interface upgrades to new RS/960 card.

     2) A T1 circuit will be installed at each T3 ENSS to allow
        a backup connection to a different CNSS. This will provide
        some redundancy in the case of T3 circuit or primary CNSS
        failure.

     3) Network source/destination pair traffic statistics collection for
        the T3 nodes. This feature is provided on the T1 backbone

     4) Open Systems Interconnection/Connectionless Network Protocol
        (OSI/CLNP) support. This feature is provided on the T1 backbone
        currently.

     5) Upgrade selected T3 ENSS ethernet interfaces to new RS/960
        ethernet card.

     6) Topology Changes:

             o Moving the Washington D.C. area CNSS to a new MCI POP for
               closer proximity to several ENSS locations.  The tail
               circuits of the existing network attachments to this
               POP will be reduced to local access circuits only.

             o Deploy a new CNSS in Atlanta to reduce the GA Tech T3 tail
               to local access only, and provide expansion capability in
               the southeast.

     Jamshid Mahdavi and Jon Boone helped the PSC join in the recent
     audio and video multicast of the plenary sessions of the IETF.  We
     ran BBN's dvc for video and Van Jacobson's vat on a Sparcstation
     1+.  Besides viewing the multicast ourselves, we performed a local
     redistribution of the multicast.  About 20 PSC staff members
     followed along with some of the sessions.

     Gene Hastings, Matt Mathis and Wendy Huntoon of the PSC attended
     the IETF conference.  Gene chaired the Network Joint Management and
     Network Status Reports working groups.  Matt chaired the BGP
     (Border Gateway Protocol) Deployment working group, which is
     fostering BGP in the Internet.  The current global BGP topology was
     presented, including a description of the European "EBONE" which
     uses BGP as its interior routing protocol.  Many router vendors
     described their BGP plans.  There is a strong consensus that BGP is
     needed as soon as the vendors can support it.  ANS publicly offered
     to help vendors with interoperability testing, this will be a big
     push for BGP.

     Matt, Gene and Wendy also attended a FARNET - NSF IIREN workshop to
     produce a technical commentary to the draft solicitation for the
     new NSFnet recompetition.  Gene is a member of the organizing
     committee.  The final document was unanimously supported by the NSF
     Supercomputing Center directors.  A response to the NSF will be
     publicized and all attendees were urged to make their own
     responses.  Attendees to the meeting included a broad spectrum of
     administrative, policy and technical people.

     SDSC Network Activities
     =======================

     In support of the joint SDSC/ScrippsClinic/UCSD Med School
     SigGraph92 Showcase (an electron microscope at UCSD was controlled
     from the Showcase) we established a FDDI link to Scripps Clinic
     using loaned NSC equipment.  This will be the beginning of the MAN
     ring linking sites here on the mesa.

     We also ran some end to end test between SDSC and ANL (as a stand-
     in for the SigGraph show floor) which showed disappointing
     performance.  After some follow-up tests are run this month, we
     will post our results.

     We have taken our UltraNet hub out of service and are in the
     process of removing the various interface cards.  As a replacement,
     we plan to use FDDI in the short term.  Our permanent solution will
     be the NSC HiPPI P32 switch.

     For the CASA gigabit testbed project, we have ordered a HiPPI
     attached frame buffer and a HiPPI attached Sun workstation to run
     the HILDA network analysis system. We have also placed an order for
     a HiPPI link level tester to help maintain our fast growing HiPPI
     LAN.

     SDSC Applied Network Research Group
     ===================================

     The ANR group at SDSC has completed two papers in network analysis,
     and is currently in the middle of projects which will lead to
     several others.

     The first paper is a description of recent traffic characteristics
     of the T1 NSFNET backbone.  We present this paper as a followup to



Cooper                                                         [Page 29]

Internet Monthly Report                                        July 1992


     the 1973 landmark paper by Kleinrock on ARPANET measurement and
     analysis.  We include a description of the NSFNET environment,
     including available instrumentation and operationally available
     data sets.  The measured quantities include: longterm growth in
     traffic volume, including attribution to domains and protocols;
     trend in average packet size on the network, both over long and
     medium term intervals; most popular sources, destinations, and site
     pairs; source-centric favoritism; international distribution of
     traffic; mean utilization statistics, both of the overall backbone
     as well as of specific links of interest; delay statstics; and,
     assessment of downtime for the last few years.

     The second paper is an exposition on measurement considerations for
     assessing unidirectional latencies.  We actively evaluated single
     direction latencies to selected destinations of the Internet
     utilizing a variety of paths.  Our objective was to demonstrate
     that round-trip latencies are an insufficient and sometimes
     misleading method to determine unidirectional delays.  This claim
     has significant implications for today's high-speed, multi-
     application networking environments which often require
     predictability of precise delay.  For example, designers of real-
     time applications who intend to deploy their products on the
     Internet, or some wide-area, high-speed, highly aggregated network,
     should be aware that across the periphery of such an environment,
     symmetric delay will serve unpredictably as a model of network
     performance.

     Another ANR project underway is an investigation of the delay,
     throughput and reliability characteristics of [transport layer]
     connections. This project will include a routing dynamics component
     to account for system routing dynamics. We have designed
     experiments to measure delay, delay variance, reliability and
     connection throughput for a variety of end-to-end configurations.
     An end goal is to mathematically parametrize these quantities in
     terms of some base network quantities, such as: number of ASs
     traversed; size (hops, delay, etc.)  of transit AS; min, max,
     average data switching speeds; or average routing instabilities.
     The project objective is a better response to the questions: How
     does the Internet perform? Can we predict its performance based on
     path information?

     ANR is pursuing ongoing investigation into the visualization of
     network phenomenon and characteristics.  Initially, we would like
     to focus on geographic representation of traffic flow between
     countries, for example the animation of selected frames to produce
     a visual time series of this data.

Internet Monthly Report                                        July 1992


     Finally, we continue to exploring traffic sampling techniques and
     their effect on the characterization of wide-area high speed
     traffic.  The project objective is to investigate the effect of
     sampling on our ability to answer selected questions about traffic
     characteristics on high speed networks.  We are motivated by the
     increasing difficulty in fully monitoring high-speed wide area
     network environments.

     We therefore intend to investigate a variety of sampling parameters
     and frequencies, and compare the answers to various questions:
     packet type distribution, geographical distribution of traffic.  We
     would like to assess confidence intervals for the resulting values.
     Eventually, we hope the project enables us to construct an optimal,
     stochastic sampling technique which responds to dynamic
     characteristics of the environment.

     1.   Thanks to Louie Mamakos a version of the Network Time Protocol
          Version 3 (NTPv3) supporting the RSA Message Digest 5
          algorithm is now available and in test. Use of this algorithm
          allegedly avoids the red-tape export controls placed on the
          Digital Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm formerly used for
          this purpose.

     2.   Thanks to the kindness of Digital Equipment, we now have a
          pair of DECstation 5000/240 workstations for use in
          timekeeping experiments. These are to be equipped with FDDI
          interfaces and flashy clock-interface boards capable of
          submicrosecond resolution.

     3.   The document "Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP)" has been

     4.   NTPv3 has been deployed in DARTnet and several overseas
          networks, besides many sites in the U.S. and Canada. It is
          hoped that widespread replacement of earlier versions can
          reduce the overheads at presently overloaded servers such as
          umd1.umd.edu, which now suffers some 70 packets per second,
          many times what was once thought a redline condition.

     The FOX project is a DARPA and NSF sponsored effort to provide a
     basis for operational X.500 deployment in the NREN/Internet.  This
     work is being carried out at Merit, NSYERNet/PSI, SRI and ISI.  ISI
     is the main contractor and responsible for project oversight.

        ISI is working on an RFC to be called "User's Guide to Portable
        DUAs." This document explains how users with an absolute minimal
        familiarity with X.500 and ISODE can easily set up DUAs in their
        own environments. The DUAs require only small portions of the
        ISODE environment to be present, sparing the user the hassle of
        dealing with ISODE's voluminous directory tree. This document

     NIST/GSA X.500 Pilot
     --------------------

     Dialup access to a Directory user interface is now available, for
     those agencies not in possession of Directory User Agent (DUA)
     software.  Users may log in to an account on the pilot DSA host
     system via modem.  The guest account will automatically run a
     Widget user interface and connect into the pilot DSA.

     Custos (the NIST X.500 Implementation)
     --------------------------------------

     July saw the completion of a statistics package which enables us to
     glean usage information for the pilot, based on the operational log
     record produced by the DSA. Information collected includes: the
     number of DSA restarts (an indication of how many times the DSA was
     shut down or crashed each month); the number of incoming
     connections handled, both over the DAP, DSP and in total, which
     gives an indication of frequency of use; the number of Directory
     operations processed, an indicator of intensity of use; and a
     breakdown by operation of the kinds of operations performed, which
     gives an indication of the most common types of usage (such
     information will be useful in determining how to optimize a
     particular DSA configuration).  Statistics will be collated on a
     monthly basis from now on and included with this report.  The
     statistics for July 8 through July 31 were as follows:

     Number of DSA restarts:         6
     Number of DAP connections:      13
     Number of DSP connections:      0
     Total number of operations:     41

     Looking to the Future
     ---------------------

     As the pilot gains momentum, it may be necessary to provide access
     from non-Unix based systems. One possible method of achieving this
     might be to use a "lightweight" DUA package, linked into a server
     based here at NIST.  Several of these packages are available, eg
     for the Macintosh and the PC.  They use a stripped down form of the
     Directory Access Protocol to communicate with a server running on a
     larger system. This server then formulates full DAP operation
     requests and ships them out to a DSA over the full protocol stack.

PARADISE
--------

     The last few months has seen the addition of several new countries
     to the international pilot:  Brazil (Federal University of Rio
     Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre), Czechoslovakia (Institute of
     Automation & Communication, Banska Bystrica (Slovakia)) and Greece
     (Institute of Computing, Heraklio (Crete)).  In addition the new
     states of Slovenia and Croatia are ready to register as c=SI and
     c=HR but will temporarily be listed as localities under the root.
     This is because the old ISO codes are compiled into ISODE 7.0, and
     so the new codes would not be accepted by DSAs running the old
     software.  As of today, eight universities in Poland have joined
     the pilot.  All these countries are running QUIPU DSAs.  Keen
     interest is being shown in Hungary, Korea and Turkey who are all
     expected to run servers in the near future.

     The latest version of the PARADISE International Report (#3) is now
     available in hard copy as well as from the info-server.  In
     addition to the country status notices, the report contains
     articles on the following:

             o       Corporate Concerns
             o       Service Providers
             o       DSA Survey

     The project has also produced a number of metrics reports over the
     last few months which are (or will shortly) be available from the
     info- server (info-server@paradise.ulcc.ac.uk).  These are:

             o       DSA metrics
             o       DUA metrics
             o       Pilot metrics

     All three of these documents will be on rfc track.

     In addition to the near-conformance testing being carried out by
     the PTT Research Labs in the Netherlands, the project has been
     directly involved in interworking discussions and testing with ICL
     (UK), Siemens Nixdorf (Germany), U.COM X.500 (France) and DirWiz
     (Italy).  Details of this work are contained in the first
     interoperability report.  Also related to this activity, the
     project has produced a DSA survey of over 20 implementations.  This
     is available as part of the International Report or electronically.

     "de" the PARADISE Directory Enquiries is available interactively
     from the central server (128.86.8.56, type dua at the login:
     prompt), or as part of ISODE 8.0.  The project issued a third
     release of the software last month, which incorporates ufn
     searching, read/list opertations when accessing non-QUIPU DSAs (eg
     in France), and locality/ state searching.

     The project is also piloting a new tool, "idm" the interactive
     Directory manager, which will be run centrally (128.86.8.56, type
     idm at logi: prompt) and released to local sites on request.  This
     tool allows users (with appropriate access control) to add new
     organsiations into the Directory and then to add, modify or delete
     entries.  It is seen as an ideal way to help SMEs (small to medium
     size enterprises) actively participate in the pilot, as well as a
     tool to allow users in large organisations to have limited access
     to their own entries.  Time will tell ..
