business day of the month describing the previous month's activities.

These reports should be submitted via network mail to:

     Ann Westine Cooper (Cooper@ISI.EDU)

     NSF Regional reports - To obtain the procedure describing how to
     submit information for the Internet Monthly Report, send an email
     message to mailserv@is.internic.net and put "send imr-procedure" in
     the body of the message (add only that one line; do not put a
     signature).

Requests to be added or deleted from the Internet Monthly report list
should be sent to "imr-request@isi.edu".

     Details on obtaining the current IMR, or back issues, via FTP or
     EMAIL may be obtained by sending an EMAIL message to "rfc-
     info@ISI.EDU" with the message body "help: ways_to_get_imrs".  For
     example:

             To: rfc-info@ISI.EDU

INTERNET RESEARCH REPORTS
-------------------------

     PRIVACY AND SECURITY
     --------------------

        The Privacy and Security Research Group (PSRG) met at South Lake
        Tahoe on June 26-29.  The PSRG reviewed the preparations for the
        Internet Society Symposium on Network and Distributed System
        Security, sceheduled for February 16-17, 1995 in San Diego.  Jim
        Ellis, the symposium general chair, joined the discussion via
        phone from Pittsburg, and provided a status update.  The group
        also recieved briefings my members on various topics, including
        the ACM Crypto Policy panel, DoD Goal Security Architecture
        documents, Secure HTTP, a software key escrow proposal from TIS,
        the SILS (IEEE 802.10) key management protocol, and the followon
        to the RACE program in the EU.  The group reviewed the status of
        the Internet Security Architecture document and made plans to
        revise and release several of the chapters of this document
        later in 1994.  Finally, the PSRG devoted some time to
        discussion of security requirements and mechanisms for use with
        autonomous information retrieval agents (e.g., Knowbots), and
        made plans to continue discussion of that topic in the future.
        The next meeting of the PSRG is schedule for late September or
        early October at NIST.

INTERNET ENGINEERING REPORTS
----------------------------

     1. Let me remind everyone that the next meeting of the IETF will
        be held in Toronto, Canada from July 25 through July 29, 1994.
        This meeting is being hosted by The University of Toronto. The
        Newcomers' Orientation and Registration Reception will be on
        Sunday, July 24. Logisitic messages and registration forms have
        already been sent to the IETF Announcement list.

        Following the July meeting, the IETF will be in San Jose from
        December 5-9. We currently working on the IETF meetings in 1995.
        Once all the arrangements have been made, notifications will be
        sent to the IETF Announcement list. Remember that information
        on future IETF meetings can be always be found in the file 0mtg-
        sites.txt which is located on the IETF shadow directories.

INTERNET PROJECTS
-----------------

ANSNET/NSFNET BACKBONE ENGINEERING
----------------------------------

     Network Status Summary
     =======================

     ANSnet total packet traffic decreased by about 0.75% in June'94.
     The process of CIDR aggregation continued in June.  An increase in
     the ANSnet forwarding table size of 1% was observed during the
     month of June.

     April Backbone Traffic Statistics
     ==============================

     The total inbound packet count for the ANSnet (measured using SNMP
     interface counters) was 61,782,591,066 on T3 ENSS interfaces, up
     2.62% from May.  The total packet count into the network including
     all ENSS serial interfaces was 70,462,985,795 down .81% from May.

     Router Forwarding Table Statistics
     ================================

     The maximum number of destinations announced to the ANSnet during
     June was 17,791 up 1% from May.  This modest increase in the
     monthly forwarding table size indicates the possible slowing of
     CIDR aggregation.

     The number of network destinations configured for announcement to
     the ANSnet but never announced (silent nets) during June was
     14,265.

     BGP-4/CIDR Deployment Status
     ============================

     No new autonomous systems began exchanging routing information with
     ANSnet via the BGP-4 protocol during June.

     As of July 6 '94, we have observed the withdrawal of 6,081 class
     based destinations from the ANSnet router forwarding tables that
     are now represented by 952 configured aggregates.  Among these
     configured aggregates:







Cooper                                                          [Page 9]

Internet Monthly Report                                        June 1994


        862 of these are top-level aggregates (not nested in another
        ggregate).

        751 of these are actively announced to ANSnet.

        653 of these have at least one subnet configured (the other 98
        may be saving the Internet future subnet announcements).

        540 of these have resulted in the withdrawal of at least one
        configured more specific route.

        526 of these have resulted in the withdrawal of 50% of their
        configured more specific routes.

        510 of these have resulted in the withdrawal of most (80%+) of
        their more specific routes.

        For up-to-date information is available from merit.edu:
        pub/nsfnet/cidr/cidr-savings.

        For further details on these CIDR aggregates, see
        merit.edu:pub/nsfnet/cidr/nestings.announced for full listings.

     Routing Stability Measured on the T3 Network
     ============================================

     Internal routing stability measurements are made by monitoring
     short term disconnect times (disconnects of five minutes duration
     or less).  This is intended as a measure of overall system
     stability rather than complete connectivity.  These measurements

     The histograms for June again reflected the best AS 690 internal
     stability on record.  This was due to there being no new router
     system software deployment, no new routing software deployment,
     fully dynamic reconfiguration, and no major circuit or equipment
     problems in the ANS backbone.

     External route flap reports have been completely rewritten to
     accomodate differences in the way routes are withdrawn in BGP-4
     (there is never an AS path included) and the support of CIDR.  The
     previous reports are described in:

     ftp.ans.net:/pub/info/routing-stats/ExternalRouteFlapReports

     The improved reports have been sent to AS~s bordering AS 690 since
     late May.  Reliable data is available for Jun 8th on.  The monthly
     summary reporting programs have not yet been fully converted.
     Summaries will be available in the July report.  A brief

        Point of contact: Craig Partridge, craig@bbn.com

     More complete reports of the above projects will be provided in the
     future.  This month, BBN provides a more elaborate report of its
     Scalability project.  The goals of this project are to study the
     internetworking requirements of distributed interactive simulation
     (DIS) and the capabilities of alternative internet
     technologies/architectures to fulfill these requirements.

     Scalability

     With the pressing need to ensure that the Defense Simulation
     Internet (DSI) is ready to support this Fall's STOW-Europe (STOW-E)
     exercises, emphasis on BBN's Scalability Task has shifted.
     Earlier, we were focusing almost exclusively on the long-term
     networking requirements of distributed interactive simulation
     (DIS).  These days, we are focusing on finding the convergence
     between current DSI capabilities and STOW-E capacity and latency
     requirements.

     The DSI is complex and has many configuration options.  Moreover,
     it is undergoing multiple upgrades.  The bandwidth of the U.S.
     backbone has recently been doubled (to 2xT1), and there are plans
     to increase the bandwidth of the European segment, so that it will
     be uniformly provisioned with links of at least T1 capacity.  The
     NES end-to-end encryption units are being upgraded to enable an
     approximate 50% increase in throughput capacity.  New software is
     being deployed in the BBN T/20 gateways, and one of the benefits of
     this new software is the ability to use multiple NESes in parallel,
     thereby further increasing the capacity of the simulation site
     access links.

     While these changes are occurring, BBN is testing the performance
     of DSI technology in the laboratory.  Over the past month, we have
     been subjecting individual DSI components to throughput testing in
     which we have identified both unidirectional and bidirectional
     throughput limits for a variety of packet sizes.  Currently,
     testbed configurations of typical DSI end-to-end paths are being
     assembled, and traffic generators are being used to find the upper
     limits of loss-free throughput.  We are also recommending
     additional changes to DSI configuration to enable the accommodation
     of greater numbers of participating sites and higher volumes of
     traffic.  In early July, we will be constructing traffic generators
     that represent the Government's best predictions of actual STOW-E
     traffic volumes, packet sizes, and arrival behavior.  These will be
     applied to laboratory set-ups to further tune DSI capacity to meet

Internet Monthly Report                                        June 1994


     by Karen D. Frazer <kfrazer@is.internic.net>

     DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES
     -------------------------------

     Our users frequently ask us why various well-known organizations
     cannot be found in our whitepages directory services.

     We use a number of different tools to provide whitepages service.
     They have various advantages, but they also have some
     disadvantages.

     One of the tools we use is X.500.  X.500 is a directory service
     based on international standards.  Its model of the world is a tree
     - the top of the tree consists of entries for countries, and
     organizations can be entered under the countries.  In some
     countries, there are entries for geographical subdivisions (e.g.
     states in the USA), and organizations can be entered under these
     subdivisions.

     Our X.500 server is part of a world-wide directory tree that
     includes more than 1 million entries for individuals.  Still, we
     must remember that these 1,000,000+ entries do not contain everyone
     on the Internet.

     These entries are maintained by various organizations that run
     X.500 servers for their own users.  Since not every organization on
     the Internet runs an X.500 server, there are many people who cannot
     be found in X.500.  If you have tried to find someone in X.500 and
     received a message saying that the organization cannot be found, it
     does not mean that the organization does not exist or that it is
     not connected to the Internet - it probably just means that the
     organization does not support an X.500 server.

     Another popular tool we support is Netfind.  Netfind was developed
     at the University of Colorado by Mike Schwartz, and makes use of
     common Internet tools like "finger" to find people.  It does not
     depend on directories that have been built by organizations
     connected to the Internet; rather, it searches through a number of
     machines on the net, looking for a machine that knows about the
     target person of the search.  It uses various rules and information
     it has gathered to narrow the search to a likely set of machines.

     Because Netfind does not depend on directories set up by
     organizations attached to the Internet, it can find people that

     NETSTATION
     ----------

     Work this month has focused primarily on software investigation and
     development.

     Display Server Investigation
     ----------------------------

     A graduate student, Munnangi S. K. Reddy, was hired to investigate
     how to partition the X11 Display Server.  The objective is to split
     the server into two parts: "higher" and "lower".  He will them
     implement a server along those lines.

     The "lower", or more fundamental bitmap manipulation portion of the
     server, we desire to closely associate with the frame buffer,
     interfacing it to the network, so that the physical display device
     becomes a network peripheral.  The analogy would be to transform
     the bitmap-manipulation procedures within the X-server into remote
     procedure calls (RPCs).

     With the advent of gigabit LANs, the focus on minimizing network
     traffic is no longer as important.  One of the research questions
     that we are asking is: Is it practical to substitute a gigabit LAN
     for a system bus?  In terms of a display interface design, this
     asks whether or not the raster-op level routines can be called via
     RPCs.

     Evidently, X is not ideally partitioned for this as was the Sun
     Pixrect display driver.  However, X has become a standard and it
     does not seem realistic to use anything but X at this juncture.
     The implementation will not be strightforward.  Many procedures
     need to be ported and the server partition made at a point where
     few up-calls will occur from the lower part of the server to the
     upper part, yet the partition must be low enough to fairly test bus
     substitution.

     LANai 1.1 Software Development
     ------------------------------

     The focus of LANai development during the past month has been on
     implementing a light-weight reliable-packet protocol.  In this
     case, the protocol executes "inside" the LAN.  A higher-layer
     protocol that passes a packet to it, inherits reliable transmission
     properties.  This offloads that task from the host itself.



Cooper                                                         [Page 20]

Internet Monthly Report                                        June 1994


     This work is designed to test the proposition that a better
     approach to obtaining higher RPC performance within a gigabit LAN
     may be to perform the reliability function within the LAN itself,
     with the retransmission timeout and retransmission taking place
     underneath the host.  Since RPCs are the cornerstone of message-
     based distributed computing, the success of this approach would
     have strong positive effect on cluster computing.

     RPCs tend to be small packets.  The focus of performance here
     shifts from TCP's focus on reliability and high bandwidth, to a
     focus on reliability and a high number of packets per second.

     This partitioning is made possible with the new facilites of the
     LANai.  It is accomplished by utilizing a time-event driven
     facility within the LANai, which was discussed last month, and by
     adopting a light-weight source-interface to destination-interface
     protocol that allows one unacknowledged reliable message packet to
     be outstanding on a connection.  While that is not a good idea on
     slower or long-haul networks due to its negative effect upon
     throughput, for a gigabit LAN the round-trip delay can be
     sufficiently short that for RPCs the limitation may be more
     theoretical than practical.

     The merits/failings of this approach will be closely tied to the
     performance of the system.  Implementation is more or less complete
     and debugging is underway.  Performance figures should be available
     by the time the next monthly report is written.

     THE US DOMAIN

     Domain Names for Local Government Agencies

     The locality based domain names are the fundamental concept for
     naming in the US Domain.

             <host>.<locality>.<state-code>.US.

     Within the locality namespace are cities and counties.

             <host>.CI.<locality>.<state-code>.US.
             <host>.CO.<locality>.<state-code>.US.

     A "CI" branch was created for city government agencies, and "CO"
     was created for county government agencies.  Due to the fact that
     GOV is designed for Federal agencies only, many local governments
     have already begun registering in the US Domain.  To find out how
     to register a domain name for your local government, send a message
     to us-domain@isi.edu.

        NYSERNet also coordinates a variety of K-12 projects.  One that
        has received considerable media coverage and nationwide interest
        is the Women In Science, Engineering, and Math Mentors Program.
        The program was piloted last spring and is concluding its first
        full school year program on June 7th, 1994.  Through the
        program, high school girls are electronically connected to a
        multitude of professional women for a five month period of
        interviewing and dialogue.  They also meet in person for a day
        of shadowing in the workplace and for the opening and closing
        luncheon activities and training.  The program has recently
        received a grant from the American Association for the
        Advancement of Science (AAAS) to expand this year's program to
        include young women from the government housing projects in
        Rochester.  There are plans to extend this program to statewide
        participants regionally through our affiliates.  For more info.

        NYSERNet introduced the Breast Cancer Information Clearinghouse
        gopher and WWW servers to the Internet.  The BCIC will be a
        partnership of many organizations which provide information
        about breast cancer to the public.  Current partners include the
        NYS Division of the American Cancer Society, and the CNY Chapter
        of the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation among many
        others.  Partners provide print materials to NYSERNet which are
        scanned and made available on-line.  If you have gopher access,
        gopher to nysernet.org and choose the BCIC from NYSERNet's main
        menu.  If you are using a WWW browser, point your URL to

The 17th RIPE Meeting

   The 17th RIPE Meeting was held in January 1994 in Amsterdam, The
   Netherlands.  Review and approval of the agenda and minutes of the
   last meeting was first, with parallel sessions starting after general
   plenaries.

1.  RIPE NCC Report by Daniel Karrenberg

   During the last quarter, the RIPE NCC Staff included Daniel, Anne
   Lord, Tony Bates, and Marten Tempstra, with NCC funding.  Now, the
   RIPE NCC also has PRIDE (Policy Based Routing Implementation and
   Deployment in Europe) funding (January 1994).  New staffers include
   Geza Terchany and Geert Jan de Groot.  The RIPE NCC basically works
   as one team, despite the funding situation.  There are no split
   personalities.  Since the NOC operations started two years ago, the
   Internet has tripled in size.  The number of Internet service
   providers has increased by that factor, also.  The number of books on
   the Internet has grown even faster.  Meanwhile, the staffing of the
   NCC core of services has stayed the same.  There is a problem with
   this.  The NCC core of services needs more staff in 1994.  Geza is
   only a six months hire.  The RIPE NCC needs more trained staff.

   The RIPE NCC Internet Registry (IR)

   Registry

         - revised registration procedures
         - application for blocks of Class Cs need extra checking
         - RIPE handles will happen

   Address Space

         - approximately 18 per week
         - approximately 100 Class Cs per working day

Internet Monthly Report                                        June 1994


   Local Registry

         - 83 registries (24 "last resort")
         - still do most of the work
         - more large requests

   Database Objects Processed

         Quarter 1       Quarter 2       Quarter 3       Quarter 4

           27938          28110           58189           42767

      The new "automatic" software has proven itself.  There has been
      excellent feedback from the community.  There has been an increase
      in the update frequency.  A database is needed to provide
      documentation and software release.  On the other hand, coverage
      still needs to be improved.

   Document Store

      The document store is well used, with continuing efforts to
      improve the presentation.  Presentations and publications for a
      wide audience are requested and welcomed.

   Joint Projects

      GISD (Generic Interface Service Description) needs continuation.
      An editor is being sought (funding is available).  The PRIDE
      project is going very well.  Tools have been released
      (prtractroute, prcheck).  There is a prpath prototype and
      documentation being created (guides, courses).  Infrastructure
      work is going on, with additional office space being provided this
      month (January 1994).  The computing center is utilizing used SUN
      ELCs.  There has been an increase in incoming faxes and electronic
      mail.

   Odds and Ends

      NCC Connectivity:

      NCC -->  NIKHEF --> SURFNET-EMPS

      Concerns within the community include:

         universal connectivity
         commercial advantage of NCC proposals
         NCC neutrality

Internet Monthly Report                                        June 1994


      These problems are being addressed.

   2.  RIPE NCC Funding - Rob Blokzijl

      Not all funds have been secured yet.  Service providers are urged
      to contact the RIPE NCC.  Daniel Karrenberg needs an increase in
      staff.  This must be resolved this year.  The RIPE NCC Activity
      Plan (1994-1995) is still being worked on.  One or two comments
      have been received.  Basically, those comments pointed out
      spelling and grammatical errors, and that's it.  A short
      discussion could be worth while, but approval should come back by
      this coming Wednesday (see Appendix for the Draft plan).

   3.  Policy Based Routing Implementation and Deployment in Europe
      (PRIDE) -
   Tony Bates

      The organization of PRIDE consists of only one FTE for the first
      three months.  One-third of the time is allotted to Daniel.  The
      second position is filled by Marten Tempstra, which started
      January 1994.  The PRIDE plan is available.

      Tool Status

         The current release of PRIDE Tools is 1.0.3.  There have been
         general fixes.  Keep those suggestions coming.  The PRIDE
         mailing list is set up, including an archive.  The general
         PRIDE FTP directory:

            ftp.ripe.net: pride/tools
                        : pride/docs
                        : pride/reports

      The Future

         The first PRIDE Guide and Course is due in week ten (10).  It
         is on schedule, and general discussion and ideas have begun.
         The structure is related to RIPE-81++.  An alpha version of the
         "prpath" tools is in test mode at the NCC.  PRIDE will detail
         all possible paths from A to B, according to information
         compiled.

      Related Activities

         The RIPE PR/Database and the software and documents are an
         integral part of the PRIDE work.  The population of the RIPE RR
         (Routing Registry) is by non-RIPE service providers.  There has
         been a pilot set up with Alternet.  More are needed.  Daniel

         and Tony will attend the regional techs meeting to discuss
         PRIDE and related issues.

      Quick Summary

         The Route Server (RS) project is officially over, but the PRIDE
         project is operating the RS.  The Route Server itself is fully
         operational.  The new "gated" is a considerable improvement in
         both performance and stability.  It also contains support for
         BGP4 in detail.

            - A large amount of alpha testing done in "Kludge"
              mode as per RIPE-03.
            - All working automatically.

         Is it doing anything?  Yes.  It is acting in "pilot" mode for
         NORDUNET for over two months as the secondary NEXT_HOP provider
         for updates to AS690.

      What's Next?

         -  Use of PRIDE tools to build RS configurations
         -  Work on CIX RS/RR
         -  Possible project to set up a second European route server
            at the GIX.
         -  Combined as an RR.
         -  D-GIXs, et al?

4.  Network Information Discovery for Users Support (NIDUS WG)

   The NIDUS WG, chaired by Nandor Hovarth, held a session at this RIPE
   meeting.

   A. Blasco Bonito lead a continued discussion regarding GARR's Network
   Resource Guide.  At the last RIPE meeting, the group felt that this
   resource guide could have two paths to follow.

      -continue building on the guide as is and keep enhancing it
      -find out if a pilot project group needs to be started to
       help in the development of the specialization of each item
       within the guide
      -would RIPE be the forum for this pilot or RARE?

   A. Blasco Bonito updated the group that this effort has now included
   discussion on an on-line modified WAIS server.  The reaction so far
   has been positive.  This work has been shown to RARE, but no one from
   GARR had a chance to attend the RARE meetings in Warsaw, so there has
   not been any opportunity to continue talks with RARE.  Meanwhile,

Internet Monthly Report                                        June 1994


   GARR has decided to go ahead with the document at the national level.
   This includes setting up a WAIS/Gopher server, developing a simple to
   use template on a national level and circulating it.  A question was
   raised, "Are people following through and filling out and returning
   the template?"  Yes.  Response has been positive.

   Joyce Reynolds presented a report on the IETF User Services Area
   activities and meetings held during the Houston IETF in November.
   She also reported on the EARN Network Services Conference, the
   EARNINFO Group, and the RARE ISUS WG meeting, all held in Warsaw,
   Poland in October (see Appendix).

5.  Connectivity Working Group (Status Report on Russia) - Rob Blokzijl

   Three different endeavors that are currently going on in Russia with
   the help from outside organizations were discussed at this session.
   Rob provided information on the RELCOM, FREENET, EUnet, and NSF.  A
   description of the Radio-MSU Network effort (DESY-Germany) was
   discussed, as were the efforts of the NASA Goddard Space Flight
   Center's (GSFC) involvement in Russia.

   RELCOM/FREENET/EUnet/NSF

      RELCOM is the commercial line from Moscow to St. Petersburg.  The
      RELCOM node is only a copper wire connection.  It will be fiber in
      a few weeks (60Km in length).  The first stage will include
      fifteen nodes (Steve Goldstein and NSF helped).  FREENET, EUnet,
      RELCOM, NSF are all trying for more fiber instead of copper wire.

      The figure below shows the current schema.  There have been
      attempts to link fiber to the southern area (M9), but there are
      problems with the length of cable.  Rob (as a NSF representative)
      is waiting for a proposal from Russia regarding expanding the
      cable.  Rob mentioned that Russia has certain components that are
      still missing which are critical to their connectivity.  They need
      full completion of the project before connectivity can become a
      reality.

   In the figure above, Rob mentioned that the first working connection
   was the RELCOM/St. Pete line.  The speed of the modems ranges from
   2Mb up to 8Mb (they are mostly 4Mb).  The routers have not been
   ordered yet.  Once they are ordered, it will take up to six months
   for them to arrive.  The routers are an integral part to the
   connectivity.  Currently, there is just a point to point connection.

   Radio-MSU Network

   Radio-MSU Network, which is a combined satellite/microwave network
   has been set up between three institutes in the Moscow region and
   DESY (Germany).

   The problem of getting the low speed for the Moscow region is that it
   has very cheap satellite links from the former Soviet Union.  Rob has
   letters from five separate institutions to work on the satellite
   links.  Yet, what will be the reliability of the routers?  Another
   problem for discussion is the commercial versus the non-commercial
   ideas.  The funding by DESY/DFN (the Germany Ministry of Research and
   Technology) is improving network connectivity.  Work is in process of
   cleaning up the other lines.

   The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) is working on a project
   with a Russian project, called "IKI", with a 256Kbps link.  This
   project is very heavily space science oriented on the first tier.
   Low speed, high speed is all NASA has planned in conducting space

   science projects between NASA and IKI.  Currently, NASA's lines are
   all synchronous.  The Russians have suggested using asynchronous
   lines, as there are problems in Moscow with synchronous.  The big
   question, "Will it ever work?"

   1. Introduction

      The RIPE NCC has been working since 1 April 1992 on the basis of an
      Activity Plan defined by RIPE in 1991. In September 1993 the work of
      the RIPE NCC has been reviewed by a RIPE panel; the results of the
      review have been approved by RIPE, and have been published as
      document ripe-099.

      Based upon the review activity, the review panel recommended
      that a new RIPE NCC Activity Plan should be adopted, better
      reflecting the actual work of the RIPE NCC. This has resulted in
      the current document which constitutes the RIPE NCC Activity
      Plan for 1994 and 1995.

      Subsequent sections give background information on RIPE and the
      RIPE NCC. A full description of RIPE NCC activities is given,
      together with reporting mechanisms. Finally, administrative
      procedures for change control of the Activity Plan are defined.

   2. Background

      2.1 About RIPE

          RIPE (Reseaux IP Europeens) is a collaborative organisation
          open to all European Internet service providers. The
          objective of RIPE is to ensure the necessary administrative
          and technical coordination to allow the operation of a
          pan-European IP network. RIPE does not operate a network of
          its own.

          RIPE has been functioning since 1989. Currently more then 60
          organisations participate in the work. The result of the RIPE
          coordination effort is that the individual end-user is
          presented on his desktop with a uniform IP service,
          irrespective of the particular network his or her
          workstation is attached to. In December 1993, more than
          500,000 hosts throughout Europe are reachable via networks
          coordinated by RIPE. The total number of systems reachable
          worldwide is estimated at close to two million.

      2.2 About the RIPE NCC

          The RIPE Network Coordination Centre supports all those RIPE
          activities which cannot be effectively performed by
          volunteers from the participating organisations. Besides
          supporting RIPE activities in general, the RIPE NCC provides
          the following services to network operators:

             o network management database containing information
               about IP networks, DNS domains, IP routing policies and
               contact information

             o delegated Internet registry, a clearing house distributing
               Internet numbers (most importantly address space)

             o domain name system (DNS) coordination

             o graphical maps of IP networks

             o repository for network operations software

             o RIPE document store

             o interactive information service

          The RIPE NCC started operations on April 1st, 1992, and
          currently has 3 permanent staff members.

          The RIPE NCC is embedded in RIPE. This means that the RIPE
          NCC Activity Plan is defined by RIPE, and that the RIPE NCC
          reports, at least, to RIPE on a regular basis.

          The RARE association provides the formal framework for the
          RIPE NCC.

   3. Technical - Coordination Activities

      3.1 Internet Registry for Europe

          The RIPE NCC will will act as the European registry for the
          delegation of Internet numbers. The RIPE NCC will perform
          this function in close cooperation and coordination with

             a. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
             b. The global Internet Registry (currently the Internic)
             c. Local Registries of European service providers

          In exceptional cases the NCC can act as the Registry of last

          resort for European organisations.

      3.2 Maintain a database of European IP networks and their
          management information.

          The database to be maintained will contain several classes
          of objects.

          These objects are described in detail in ripe-13.  At the
          moment the following object classes have been defined:

             a. Networks
             b. Responsible persons
             c. Domains
             d. Routers
             e. International lines
             f. Name Servers

          The NCC will be responsible for the database entries; this
          includes

             a. collection of database entries
             b. checking of individual entries
             c. checking of consistency and integrity of the database

          Quarterly reports on changes in the contents of the database
          will be produced, together with statistics about the number
          of database entries.

     3.3. Distribution of the database.

          Secondary copies of the database can be installed at other
          sites upon request. It is the responsibility of the NCC to
          keep track of such secondaries.

          The RIPE NCC will provide assistance to local registries in
          setting up secondary database servers.

          An up to date record of secondary sites will be maintained
          on line.

     3.4. Coordination of database exchange with other organisations.

          The NCC will coordinate and execute the exchange of database
          information with NCC's outside Europe. The result will be
          that for the end user of the database one uniform set of
          global information will be available.

Internet Monthly Report                                        June 1994


     3.5. Keep a record of operational contact points.

          This will consist of a list of NOC's and responsible people
          that will be used as a reference list for the individual
          NOC's to be used in case of network related incidents,
          including security incidents.  Individual NOC's will be able
          to subscribe to a weekly update service.

     3.6. Placement of name servers and backup servers in Europe, and
          beyond.

          On a regular basis the interworking between the DNS name
          servers in Europe, and their connections to name servers
          outside Europe, must be checked.

          Detected errors and inconsistencies must be reported.

          Corrective actions must be followed in case of severe
          problems.

          The result will be a consistent set of name servers.

     3.7. Referral Services.

          The RIPE NCC will perform a Referral Service for Internet
          Service providers. The NCC will do this in a fair and
          impartial way.

     3.8  Coordination with Local Registries.

          The RIPE NCC will keep close contact with Local Registries
          in Europe. The RIPE NCC will assist such registries in
          setting up and maintaining their services.

          This activity may include presentations on the work of the
          RIPE NCC for broader audiences, such as relevant conferences
          and workshops. It may also include coordinated
          development of common tools.

   4. Technical - Development Activities

   NICs and NOCs and the NCC need special purpose software tools for
   their work. While some of these tools are available commercially
   others will have to either be obtained from the public domain or
   specially developed to suit local needs. The NCC will collect,
   develop, document and test such tools in order to make them
   available to the RIPE community. While some basic support will be
   given the NCC will not provide full support for these tools.

Internet Monthly Report                                        June 1994


     4.1. Database management tools.

          Tools for management of the database and their maintenance
          are an important work item for the NCC. The result will be
          the availability of a consistent database.

     4.2. Database querying tools.

          Development and maintenance of the whois utility. The result
          will be a program, available from a file server, that
          permits remote interrogation of the database.

     4.3. DNS quality control tools.

          Utilities for quality control of the interworking of the DNS
          name servers will be developed and maintained. The result
          will be a set of software and documentation, available from
          a server.

     On an ad hoc basis special projects are taking place inside the
     RIPE NCC. These projects are funded separately, but the NCC may
     give administrative, management and technical support. Therefore
     the following activity is defined:

     4.4. Special projects.

          The RIPE NCC can participate in special projects that have
          been approved by at least the RIPE community. The nature
          of the participation can be administrative, managerial or
          technical. The total amount of NCC participation should not
          exceed 20% of the NCC resources.

          Results of the special projects will be publicly available.

   5. Administrative - RIPE Activity Support

      The NCC will give the following support to the RIPE activities:

      5.1. Keeping the RIPE document store.

           The NCC will keep RIPE documents online and easily
           accessible to the RIPE community. Copies of other document
           stores relevant to the RIPE community, such as the
           repository of RFCs, will equally be provided.

           Modern document retrieval utilities will be installed and
           maintained to facilitate access to the document store.

Internet Monthly Report                                        June 1994


      5.2. Technical and secretarial support for studies undertaken by
           RIPE.

           The NCC will provide technical and clerical support for
           RIPE studies and working groups in order to enhance
           continuity and coordination of the work between RIPE
           meetings.

      5.3. Organisational support for RIPE meetings.

           RIPE meeting attendance is expected to be on the order of
           80 persons, meeting three times a year.
           The NCC will provide clerical support to organise these
           meetings in order to keep them productive.

   6. Administrative - Reporting

      The NCC will follow the following general reporting procedures:

      6.1. Quarterly reports an all activities will be produced for the
           RIPE participating organisations and the RIPE NCC funding
           organisations.

      6.2. Quarterly reports on outstanding problems will be produced
           for the RIPE participating organisations and the RIPE NCC
           funding organisations.

      6.3. The NCC reports on its ongoing work and outstanding problems
           also to each RIPE meeting.  These meetings take currently
           place three times a year.

      6.4. The NCC will produce annual reports. These will be available
           on the 31st of January following the year to be reported on.
           The annual report will contain a summary of the activities
           and an overview of the financial situation.

      All reports produced by the RIPE NCC will be publicly available.

   7. Review and Change Control

      The functioning of the RIPE NCC based on the current activity plan
      shall be reviewed in the fourth quarter of 1995. The review panel
      will consist of at least the Chairs of RIPE and the RIPE
      Working Groups.

      The current Activity Plan can be amended on request by a full RIPE
      meeting which includes the organisations that are funding the
      RIPE NCC.

         1) Jill appointed to chair INET/JENC94 User and Applications
            Support Track.
         2) Jill resigned from ISUS as Chair.


   EARN - EARNINFO

      Last Meeting:   Warsaw, Poland
                      October 1993
      Chair:          David Sitman


   -  EARN covers a larger geographical area than RARE, which includes
      Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.

   -  EARNINFO meetings are usually attended by those attending the
      EARN technical meetings, not specifically made up of user
      support people.

   -  The "real work" is performed by a paid staff.

   -  EARNINFO focuses on general end user issues.

   -  Two interesting projects in process:

         1) NETFIND - EARN Pilot
         2) "Guide to Network Resource Tools"

      -  EARN/RARE ISUS Cooperation Issues?

         A merger between EARN and RARE is not impossible and could be
         desirable, but on the other hand, something may also be said
         of healthy competition.

   For Further Information:

      1) Trip Report was filed in the Internet Monthly Report (IMR).
      2) IETF User Services Area Report (see below).

                           November 1993

10 working groups in the User Services Area of the IETF met in
Houston, Texas.


Integrated Directory Services (IDS), chaired by Tim Howes and Chris
Weider.  (Summary reported by Tim Howes.)

The IDS Working Group is chartered to facilitate the integration and
interoperability of current and future directory services into a
unified directory service.  This work will unite directory services
based on a heterogeneous set of directory services protocols (X.500,
WHOIS++, etc.).  In addition to specifying technical requirements for
the integration, the IDS Group will also contribute to the
administrative and maintenance issues of directory service offerings
by publishing guidelines on directory data integrity, maintenance,
security, and privacy and legal issues for users and administrators of
directories.

The IDS WG reviewed, discussed and/or progressed the following
documents.  Held up, pending more vendor responses, "X.500
Implementation Survey".  Held up, pending a query to Paradise, "X.500
Pilot Project Catalog".  Coming "soon" (within the next month),
"WHOIS++ Implementation Catalog", "Model for Information Privacy of
Directories", Legal Issues for Directories in Europe", "Data
Management Issues", and "Overview of Directory Services".

Also discussed was the inclusion of the CSO nameserver protocol in the
IDS effort (consensus was to include it), and the more general issue
of how do we make all these directory services work together (lots of
ideas, but no solid conclusions, yet).


Integration of Internet Information Resources Working Group (IIIR),
chaired by Kevin Gamiel and Chris Weider.  (Summary reported by Kevin
Gamiel.)

IIIR is chartered to facilitate interoperability between Internet
Information Services, and to develop, specify, and align protocols
designed to integrate the plethora of Internet information services
(WAIS, archie, Prospero, etc.) into a single "virtually unified
information service".

Internet Monthly Report                                        June 1994


Clifford Lynch discussed his paper on using the Z39.50.  Margaret St.
Pierre discussed the Internet-Draft, "WAIS over Z39.50 1988" (St.
Pierre et al).  This draft is being considered as an informational RFC
profiling the use of Z39.50 version 1988 by the traditional WAIS
protocol.  The idea of quality assurance was discussed.  Quality
assurance in this context addresses such issues as invalid pointers to
data objects, interoperability among the current information systems
and the ability to contact information maintenance personnel.  A
mailing list is now established called quality@sunsite.unc.edu.  The
idea of a data types registry was discussed and Greg Vaudreuil agreed
to write a document on using the MIME content type registry in
Amsterdam, but that document was never posted to the IIIR list.
Applications Co-Area Director John Klensin indicated that the document
had been denied by the IESG based on the fact that it undermined an
existing RFC.


Internet School Networking (ISN) session chaired by Jennifer Sellers
(NASA) and Art St. George (NSF).  (Summary reported by Jennifer
Sellers.)

The Internet School Networking Working Group is chartered to
facilitate the connection of the United States' K-12
(Kindergarten-12th Grade) schools, public and private, to the
Internet, and school networking in general.

After a period for introductions of those attending and a statement of
their interest in ISN, the group launched into a discussion of whether
it should continue to exist.  With a tentative decision to continue
activities, a revision of the body of the charter began.  This was
accomplished, and minor refinements and word-smithing will take place
on the list.  April Marine reported on her action item to investigate
the InterNIC's ability and willingness to maintain a directory of
people in primary and secondary school education who are involved in
networking.  The group then defined a set of milestones which will
take the group through March, 1995 and was therefore permitted to go
to lunch.  April's report was considered in crafting the milestones.


Networked Information Retrieval (NIR), chaired by Jill Foster and
George Brett.  (Summary reported by Kevin Gamiel.)

NIR is chartered to increase the useful base of information about
networked information retrieval tools, their developers, interested
organizations, and other activities that relate to the production,
dissemination, and support of NIR tools.  NIR is a cooperative effort
of the IETF, RARE, and CNI.

Internet Monthly Report                                        June 1994


Jim Fullton gave the current status of CNIDR.  Jill Foster gave an
overview of RARE activities in this area.  The working group split
into small groups to discuss each section of the NIR status report as
a final review.  Section 5, mailing lists and gopher among the major
areas changed.  It will be sent to the list for final comments.  April
Marine discussed the "checklist" history.  She has put together a
simple NIR tool checklist.


The Network Information Services Infrastructure Working Group (NISI),
chaired by April Marine and Pat Smith.  (Summary reported by Pat
Smith.)

NISI is exploring the requirements for common, shared Internet-wide
network information services.  The goal is to develop an understanding
for what is required to implement an information services
"infrastructure" for the Internet.

Documents: The Internet-Draft on international NIC structures and RFC
1302/FYI 12 will be completed/revised by the Seattle meeting.

NIC-Profiles: This information will be revived, working in cooperation
with the InterNIC.

NISI Future: Good discussion about the scope and role of NISI
including possible future projects.  Various plans discussed,
including possibility of ending the group and having a new group
emerge if needed, with different name and focus.  Further discussion
to take place on the list followed by action in Seattle.


Network Training Materials (TRAINMAT), chaired by Jill Foster.
(Summary reported by Ellen Hoffman.)

The Network Training Materials Working Group is chartered to enable
the research community to make better use of the networked services.
Towards this end, the Working Group will work to provide a
comprehensive package of "mix and match" training materials for the
broad academic community which will: 1) enable user support staff to
train users to use the networked services and 2) provide users with
self-paced learning material.  In the first instance, it will not deal
with operational training.  This Working Group is the IETF component
of a joint RARE/IETF group working on Network Training Materials.

The ongoing work towards a training materials catalog was reviewed.
The template for materials was reviewed, with recent changes suggested
by Pete Percival incorporated.  The WG agreed with the newest version.
Sample entries developed by a team working with Margaret Isaacs was

Internet Monthly Report                                        June 1994


reviewed, and the WG agreed that the focus should be on training
rather than documentation or resource guides, the latter which could
be included in a bibliography rather than in the main part of the
document.  Sample subject headings were reviewed, with the agreement
that these might change if documentation and guides were removed from
the body of the catalog.  Additional volunteers were recruited to
complete putting materials from the University of Newcastle catalog
into template form, with the goal of adding new materials once this
task is completed--about half the original Newcastle entries are
already in template form. Updates will be sent to the email list.
Discussion also focused on materials which might need to be developed
in the training area, particularly the usefulness of videos.  The
final segment of the session included discussion of efforts by other
groups, and a roundtable on what attendees are doing in the training
area.


User-Doc2, chaired by Ellen Hoffman and Lenore Jackson.  (Summary
reported by Ellen Hoffman.)

The User-Doc2 Working Group is preparing a revised bibliography of
on-line and hard copy documents, reference materials, and training
tools addressing general networking information and how to use the
Internet.  The target audience includes those individuals who provide
services to end users and end users themselves.

The User-Doc2 WG had a small but enthusiastic set of attendees due to
a conflicting applications group meeting that many of the usual
suspects attended.  The UD group set a new record by having everyone
in the room volunteer to assist in writing and reviewing documents in
progress!  A "Not Quite an Internet Draft" bibliography was distributed
and discussed which will update RFC 1175.  The new document will focus
on books, journals and other bibliographies rather than all possible
documentation.  A section will be developed to cover RFCs and FYIs.
The final document is scheduled to be completed before the next IETF.
A second document covering Internet connectivity is almost ready for
review, and will be distributed to the WG list.  This is a joint
project with the ISN WG.


Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI), chaired by Alan Emtage and Jim
Fullton.  (Summary reported by Alan Emtage.)

URI is chartered to define a set of standards for the encoding of
system independent Resource Location and Identification information
for the use of Internet information services.

The URI WG had three sessions in Houston.  The first two were

Internet Monthly Report                                        June 1994


dedicated to closing work on the Uniform Resource Locators, which
seems to have occurred.  The final session worked on Uniform Resource
Names.  Document drafts have been commissioned to reflect those
discussions.


User Services Working Group (USWG) chaired by Joyce K. Reynolds.
(Summary reported by JKRey.)

The USWG provides a regular forum for people interested in all user
services to identify and initiate projects designed to improve the
quality of information available to end-users of the Internet.

Gary Malkin briefly discussed the "DAWG" (Distribution and
Announcement WG) idea that has been sitting on the USWG's backburner
for awhile.  A BOF will be held at the next IETF to see if there is
further interest in this topic.  Ann Cooper led a talk and discussion
on the US Domain.  Jill Foster and Joyce Reynolds reported on the RARE
ISUS meetings and the EARN Network Services Conference which they
participated in, which was held in Warsaw, Poland.  Jill announced the
INET94/JENC5 Call For Papers - User Information Track to the USWG.
Jill was asked to run this track, and asked Joyce if she would be
co-track leader.  There was continued discussion from the Amsterdam
IETF on Bill Manning's thoughts about how to "empower" users to
utilize and document tools.


WHOIS and Network Information Lookup Service (WNILS), chaired by Joan
Gargano.  (Summary reported by Joan Gargano.)

The purpose of WNILS is to expand and define the standard for WHOIS
services, to resolve issues associated with the variations in access,
and to promote a consistent and predictable service across the
network.

Peter Deutsch led a discussion on the status of the WHOIS
Architecture.  Chris Weider and Simon Spero led a discussion on the
status of the distributed WHOIS++ model and centroids.  Chris
described changes to the draft WHOIS++ document.  Simon Spero
described the mechanism for searching a centroid tree from the bottom,
up.  Jim Fullton described the status of WHOIS ++ Clients.  Jim
mentioned the use of WHOIS++ in support of networked information
retrieval and the type of client development that is occurring as part
of other application development.  The session concluded with a
discussion on the recommendations and modifications to the WHOIS
Protocol and a discussion of WHOIS++ Implementations by Joan Gargano.
