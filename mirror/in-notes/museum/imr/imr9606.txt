     IETF Monthly Report for June, 1996

     1. The IETF met in Montreal, Quebec, Canada from June 24-28, 1996.
     While the numbers are still being verified, it appears there were
     over 1200 attendees, another IETF record!

     The IETF will be returning to San Jose, California for the final
     meeting in 1996. This meeting, to be held December 9-13, 1996, will
     be hosted by cisco Systems. Opening 1997, the IETF travels to
     Memphis, Tennessee where Federal Express will be the host.  This
     meeting will be held April 7-11, 1997. After Memphis, the IETF
     returns to Europe. While the arrangements are still being worked
     out, it looks like we'll be in Munich, Germany the week of August
     11-15, 1997.

     Once all the arrangements have been made, notifications will be
     sent to the IETF Announcement list. Remember that information on
     future IETF meetings can be always be found in the file 0mtg-
     sites.txt which is located on the IETF shadow directories.  This
     information can also be viewed from the IETF Home Page on the Web.
     The URL is:

                      http://www.ietf.cnri.reston.va.us

                                     or

                             http://www.ietf.org

     2. The minutes of the IESG teleconferences have been publicly
     available on the IETF Shadow directories since 1991. These files
     are placed in the /ftp/iesg directory.

     The following IESG minutes have been added:

                        May 23, 1996 (iesg.96-05-23)

      Progress Report for June 1, 1966 through June 30, 1996

      I.  Significant Events

     During June 1996, InterNIC Registration Services assigned the
     following network addresses, and registered domain names to include
     top-level country domains:

                            Assigned   Registered   Country Domain(s)

   Top-level Country Domain(s)                  1     QA - Qatar


     Effective June 17, the InterNIC's Help Desk hours were extended
     until 9 pm Monday through Friday, and 8am until 5pm on weekends.
     These hours were continued through July 12.

     The voice mail script was shortened to improve the efficiency of
     the system in handling customer calls.

     Customer Service Representative (CSR) work schedules were adjusted
     to allow CSRs some time to process electronic customer requests
     without telephone interruptions.

     The following actions occurred with regard to new/modify/delete
     templates: (1) new templates were introduced via FTP and the
     InterNIC Web site on June 15, 1996; (2) the template process was

     changed from three separate batches to one combined batch; (3) CSRs
     were trained in processing the new templates and in the revised
     procedures associated with the release of Guardian.

     The Complaints Research Section assisted the various InterNIC's
     registration groups by taking on complaints, allowing more time for
     registrations to be processed.

     Developed and initiated plans to accomplish billing reconciliation
     tasks and backlog reduction.

     Hosted the final Focus Group session in Herndon, Virginia.

     The InterNIC was accepted to participate in the Harvard/Commercial
     Internet Exchange (CIX)/Internet Society (ISOC) "Coordination and
     Administration of the Internet workshop scheduled for September
     1996.

     Draft versions of the Offensive Names and Lame Delegation Policies
     were completed and made available for internal review.

     Mark Kosters gave a presentation at the NANOG meeting on the
     InterNIC's status.

     Jasdip Singh made a Guardian presentation at the NANOG meeting.

     Mark Kosters, Dave Graves, Tom Newell and Chuck Gomes participated
     in the National Science Foundation (NSF) Quarterly Review held at
     the University of Wisconsin in Madison.

     Mark Kosters, Tom Newell and Dave Graves participated in a meeting
     with Larry Landweber to discuss multiple registries and multiple
     Top Level Domains (TLDs).

     The Guardian application was implemented on June 15, 1996; in
     support of Guardian, work was started to develope procedures for
     handling exception situations in the Guardian process.

     The production of 15-Day Invoices/Notices, Renewal Invoices and New
     Invoices was accelerated.

     New reports to track invoice and payment status were designed and
     made available.

     Revisions were made to the Billing Status Report to better meet
     customer needs regarding billing status of domain names.

Internet Monthly Report                                        June 1996


     Press releases were prepared and distributed to announce the
     following: (1) the implementation of Guardian; and (2) the delay of
     deactivating domain names for lack of payment until June 24, 1996.

     InterNIC telephone trunks were separated from Network Solutions
     trunks and the InterNIC trunks were changed to Central Office
     Trunks, thereby providing increased ability to isolate problems.

     INTERNIC DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES

     At the IETF in Montreal, we met with Mike Schwartz to discuss the
     Netfind software distribution.  InterNIC Directory and Database
     Services has agreed to be the distribution site for the Netfind
     code, and to build and distribute the Netfind Seed Database for
     other Netfind sites.  We have also made some modifications to
     Netfind so it will find pointers to directory information in DNS if
     they are present.

     We are also working on Harvest.  We expect to use it to index our
     Directory of Directories and to allow us to index items like web
     pages which cannot be easily handled by WAIS.

     A reminder - if you would like to help the Internet community find
     a resource that you offer, send mail to admin@ds.internic.net and
     we will send information about listing your resource in the
     Directory of Directories.  If you prefer, you can enter information
     about your resource in our WWW suggestion form.  The form can be
     reached through our Directory of Directories Web page at:

     THE US DOMAIN REGISTRY

     Some of the processing of requests to the US Domain administrator
     is now automated.  In particular, most requests to register names
     in localities already delegated are automatically forwarded to the
     administrator for that locality.

     The US Domain administrator no longer makes direct registrations of
     hosts, and only makes delegations of third or fourth level domain
     names (such as localities).

     A new policy has been added to the criteria for delegating domain
     names under the US Domain:

        It is the intention that the delegation of third level (for
        example, locality) domain names be wide spread to many
        registries.  It is undesirable for one person or organization to
        manage a large part of the third level names in any particular
        geographic or logical area.

Internet Monthly Report                                        June 1996


        No individual or organization shall have more than 500
        delegations total in the US Domain as a whole, or more than 50
        delegation in any particuilar second level (for example, a
        state).

MERIT INTERNET ENGINEERING
--------------------------

     This report summarizes June 1996 activities of Merit's Internet
     Engineering group on behalf of the Routing Arbiter (RA) service and
     other projects.

     Merit is pleased to announce the release of RAWhoisd, a high-speed
     query server that incorporates all of the capabilities of the RIPE
     whoisd server and adds many new features.  RAWhoisd offers a
     multiple command mode, in which the server accepts and services
     successive query requests until the user issues a +quit+ command.
     This feature greatly facilitates RAWhoisd's interaction with
     various tools.  In addition, RAWhoisd supports many new single and
     multi-object queries that work well with the new generation of IRR
     router configuration and network analysis tools being deployed by
     the Routing Arbiter and others.  Here are some examples:

     Users can also select which source databases to search (e.g., RADB,
     RIPE, ANS, CA*net) and in what order.  For queries retrieving
     single objects or attribute values from multiple databases,
     RAWhoisd reports if there are multiple copies of the object with
     different content in the different source databases.

     For more information about the extended capabilities of RAWhoisd,
     see the man page at:

     Sixty-three ISPs are now peering with the Route Servers at the
     Network Access Points.  Forty-three of these providers depend on
     the Route Servers for importing and exporting routes, rather than
     preferring multiple bilateral peering sessions.  The Route Servers
     offload computationally intensive routing tasks from these routers,
     freeing processing time.  For a listing of current peering
     sessions, see:

                   http://www.ra.net/statistics/bgp.peers

     Merit staff members Sue Hares, Bill Norton, Jerry Winters, and
     Elise Gerich attended the 36th IETF in Montreal during the week of
     June 23.  At the Routing Policy System Working Group meetings,
     Winters gave a presentation about the transition from RIPE-181 to
     the new Routing Policy System Language.  Gerich participated in the
     IAB open meeting and co-chaired the IEPG meeting preceding IETF.
     Hares co-chaired the IETF Inter-Domain Routing Working Group
     meeting.  At the Internet Society's Workshop on Network Technology
     for Countries in the Early Stages of Internetworking, offered in
     conjunction with INET '96, Hares taught sessions on host-based and
     backbone internetworking technology.

     IETF was also the site of a Merit GateD Consortium meeting.  The
     next release of GateD, expected this fall, will incorporate CIDR
     support in OSPF (RFC 1583), as well as support for the BGP Multi
     Exit Discriminator (MED) and Destination Preference Attribute
     (DPA).  The DPA makes it possible for multi-homed ASs to specify a
     preferred path for incoming traffic.  For more information about
     the GateD Consortium, see:
