INTERNET ENGINEERING REPORTS
----------------------------

     1. The next IETF will be meeting in Los Angeles, California from
        March 4-8, 1996. There will not be a local host for this
        meeting, but the terminal room facilities will be provided by
        Interop. Following Los Angeles, the IETF will be meeting in
        Montreal, Quebec, Canada from June 24-28, 1996. If this date
        looks familiar, it is the same date as INET '96! This is not a
        "joint" meeting, but both will be held in the Montreal
        Convention Center. Closing out the year, the IETF will be
        returning to San Jose, California on December 9-13, 1996. The
        first meeting of 1997 will be held in Memphis, Tennessee April
        7-11, 1997.

        Once all the arrangements have been made, notifications will be
        sent to the IETF Announcement list. Remember that information
        on future IETF meetings can be always be found in the file
        0mtg-sites.txt which is located on the IETF shadow directories.
        This information can also be viewed from the IETF Home Page on
        the Web. The URL is:

                     http://www.ietf.cnri.reston.va.us


     2. The minutes of the IESG teleconferences have been publicly
        available on the IETF Shadow directories since 1991. These files
        are placed in the /ftp/iesg directory.

        The following IESG minutes have been added:

           November 9, 1995 (iesg.95-11-09)


     3. The IESG approved or recommended the following 16 Protocol

     REGISTRATION SERVICES

     I.  Significant Events

     During December 1995, InterNIC Registration Services assigned the
     following network addresses, and registered domain names to include
     top-level country domains:

                                Assigned    Registered  Country Domain(s)
     Network Addresses            6,015
     Domain Names Registered                  24,423
     Top-level Country Domain(s)                   2    GI - Gibraltar
                                                        TO - Tonga

     The IP Allocation Internet Draft document is being reformatted.

     The billing backlog for new domain registrations has been
     eliminated.

     The addition of a new printer, an electronic folder and clearer
     definition of the process flow has significantly reduced the time
     required for mailing our invoices.  What used to take 1 day now
     takes about 2 hours.

     For the Receivables Section four new computers were received.  They
     will be set up and in use by Jan. 10, 1996.  These machines will
     enable us to eliminate all backlog in the department and answer
     customer's inquiries more efficiently.

     The decision was made to hire an entry level administrative
     assistant for the Receivables Section.  The interviewing process
     should occur within a month.

     Due to the continued internet growth and increased phone calls to
     the InterNIC Registration Services Help Desk, the current telephone
     system is being evaluated to ensure quality customer service.

     Kim Hubbard, Mark Kosters, and Jasdip Singh attended the IETF
     conference in Dallas.

     During December, new domain requests continued to range between

Internet Monthly Report                                    December 1995


     1,000 and 1,500 per day.  Updates ranged from 300 to 500 a day.
     Both new and update requests dropped to about half these values
     during Christmas week.  Applications that do not need human review
     are processed within a day.  Approximately 50% are handled in this
     manner.  The remaining applications and questions enter a queue for
     resolution by one of the processing staff.  This queue is currently
     a week and a half long.


     II.  Current Status

     During the month of December 1995, InterNIC Registration Services
     received communications as shown below.  The majority of the
     correspondence concerned domain billing. Other correspondence
     includes the assignment and re-assignment of network numbers and
     the registration or change of domain names.

          E-mail     89,673    (hostmaster@internic.net)
          Postal/Fax    467    (primarily IP number requests)
          Phone      12,928

     The Registration Services host computer supported the following
     information retrieval requests during the month of December:

                     Connections   Retrievals
          Gopher      32,268         64,671
          WAIS        79,679         46,918
          FTP         51,958        139,670
          Mailserv     3,744
          Telnet      75,999
          Http     1,000,674

     In addition, for WHOIS the number of queries were:

                       Client        Server
                      _______       _________

     THE US DOMAIN REGISTRY
     ======================

     The US Domain is only registering domain names providing two
     nameservers. We will no longer register direct registrations in the
     form of non-IP hosts, (i.e, UUCP connections requiring MX records),
     or IP hosts requiring A records).  The only A record we will add to
     our zone file is a glue record for a delegation.

     Please contact a local service provider to provide your primary and
     or secondary name service.

     For further information about the US Domain, send a message to:
     US-DOMAIN@ISI.EDU, or see our WEB page:

     Routing Arbiter services are now fully in production at the PacBell
     Network Access Point, as well as at the Sprint, AADS, and
     Washington, D.C. (MAE-East) NAPs.  Two Route Servers are installed
     at each NAP to provide redundancy, and are reconfigured every four
     hours with data from the Internet Routing Registry (IRR).

     The Routing Arbiter will proceed with deployment of services at the
     MAE- West interconnection point, with support from the NASA Ames
     Research Center.

     Several new Internet Service Providers are depending on the Route
     Servers for routes received at the Washington, D.C. NAP.  ESnet and
     Delphi now prefer the Route Server for each other's routes at the
     NAP, as do Delphi and PIPEX.  Other new peering sessions with the
     Route Servers were established in November by IOS at the
     Washington, D.C. and Sprint NAPs, and by AlterNet at the Sprint
     NAP.  A complete list of BGP peering sessions is available from:

         http://www.ra.net/~ra/statistics/bgp.peers

     Information about the size and content of the Internet routing
     table is now available on the Merit Web pages:

         http://www.ra.net/~ra/statistics/routes.html

     These interactive reports are calculated using data obtained via
     BGP peering sessions with the Route Servers at each Network Access
     Point.  Three types of reports are available for the NAP you
     specify:

     > Maximum number of announced routes, by date and number of routes, in
       the Route Server's routing tables.

     > Complete listing of the Internet routing table by prefix and
       associated AS path, as seen by the NAP's Route Servers.

     > Number of routes, by Route Server peer and origin AS, as seen by the

       Route Servers at each NAP.

     Note that the reports only include information from Internet
     Service Providers that peer with the NSF Route Servers.  For
     example, one of the largest providers, internetMCI, maintains a
     peering session with the Routing Arbiter at the Washington, D.C.
     NAP (MAE-East) and exports only one route to the RA.

     You can now generate NAP route flap reports by RS peer as well as
     by AS origin, prefix, and specific AS:

       http://www.ra.net/~ra/statistics/flap.html

     Another new Web form provides critical information about route
     duplication and CIDR aggregation in the Internet Routing Registry.
     The report details, for each AS you specify:

     > Which, if any, duplicate routes exist in Internet Routing Registry
       databases

     > Which, if any, covering (less specific) routes exist in the RADB or
       other registries

     You can use the "Display" menu to select whether you want to see
     all routes, only routes which are duplicated or covered, or only
     routes which are not duplicated or covered.  Use the "Formatted as"
     menu to determine whether the listing is rendered as an HTML3 table
     or as ordinary text.

     The new tool is available from:

       http://www.ra.net/~ra/RADB.tools.docs/reports.html

     Sue Hares, Steve Richardson, Jeff Jackson, and Craig Labovitz have
     completed work on a joint government/industry IDRP project funded
     by the Federal Aviation Administration and managed by the MITRE
     Corporation.  The new software just released by Merit, Version 2.0
     of IDRP in GateD, has been integrated with an Aeronautical
     Telecommunications Network router that will be used to control the
     flow of routing information between ground stations and airplanes.
     The new release supports advanced policy descriptions and
     implements a mobile Boundary Information System in IDRP.

     Elise Gerich attended an Internet naming and addressing workshop
     sponsored by NSF and hosted by Harvard University.  Discussions
     focused on the administration and management of top-level domains
     such as .com, Group meeting this month to address the future of the
     FIXes.

Internet Monthly Report                                    December 1995


     DECEMBER 1995

     This report summarizes recent activities of Merit's Internet
     Engineering group on behalf of the Routing Arbiter (RA) service and
     other projects.

     New ISPs continue to set up peering sessions with Route Servers at
     the U.S. interconnection points.  Peers added recently include
     NAP.NET, Net Access, the Defense Research Engineering Network, and
     Aimnet.  A complete list of BGP peering sessions is available from:

         http://www.ra.net/~ra/statistics/bgp.peers

     Based on feedback from ISPs who are using the RA services, the
     Routing Arbiter team is investigating ways in which global policy
     information can be maintained with the Route Servers implementing
     only a subset of the policy.

     Several new statistical reports for the NAP Route Servers are
     available on the RA Web pages.  The BGP peering report now shows
     the number of times a particular BGP peering session went idle, as
     well as the number of BGP updates received from each peer.   A new
     CPU usage report lists the daily average and minimum percentage of
     idle CPU for each Route Server.  The reports are available from:

         http://www.ra.net/~ra/statistics/rs.html

     New tools under development at Merit include:

     > ASExplorer, which explores the real-time AS routing topology of the
       Internet

     > MPath, a multi-threaded, caching version of the RIPE prpath tool.
       MPath uses IRR data to calculate all possible routing domain paths
       between a source and destination AS.

     ASExplorer and MPath are available from:

           http://www.ra.net/~ra/tools

     Merit staff members Brian Renaud, Craig Labovitz, Sue Hares, Susan
     Harris, Jake Khuon, Laurent Joncheray, Dun Liu, and Elise Gerich
     attended the 34th IETF in Dallas during the week of December 4.
     Joncheray collaborated with ANS's Jessica Yu on an Internet Routing
     Registry presentation for the Routing Policy System (RPS) Working
     Group.  Gerich participated in several meetings of the Internet
     Architecture Board.

     IETF was also the site of the first meeting of the Merit GateD
     Consortium,  an industry/academic partnership that furthers
     development and deployment of the widely used internetworking
     software.  The meeting was attended by major router vendors,
     research groups, and workstation vendors, including IBM, Hitachi,
     NetEdge, Ipsilon, and HP.  Sue Hares, technical leader of the
     Consortium, announced that Merit's future plans for GateD focus on
     stability and commercial grade quality for the software.  Merit has
     already developed a new, interactive interface to GateD that can be
     used to query internal variables such as memory usage and routing
     table contents.  Merit also plans to provide many special benefits
     to Consortium members, including new test tools and early access to
     new code.

     GateD was originally developed at Cornell University.  In September
     1995, Cornell selected Merit to take over the Consortium based on
     Merit's expertise in routing and routing protocol development.
     Further information about the consortium is available from the
     GateD Web pages:
