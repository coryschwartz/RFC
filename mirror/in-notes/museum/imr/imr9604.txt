INTERNET MONTHLY REPORTS
------------------------

The purpose of these reports is to communicate to the Internet Research
Group the accomplishments, milestones reached, or problems discovered by
the participating organizations.

Each organization is expected to submit a 1/2 page report on the first
business day of the month describing the previous month's activities.
These reports should be submitted via network mail to "IMR@ISI.EDU".

The Internet Monthly Report mailing list is now managed by MajorDomo at
ISI.EDU.  The announcements of new issues on the Internet Monthly Report
are sent to the IETF-Announce list and to this IMR list.

Requests to be ADDED or DELETED from the Internet Monthly report list
should be sent to "majordomo@isi.edu" with the message body either
"subscribe imr" or "unsubscribe imr".

Details on obtaining the current IMR, or back issues, via FTP or EMAIL
may be obtained by sending an EMAIL message to "rfc-info@ISI.EDU" with
the message body "help: ways_to_get_imrs".  For example:

INTERNET ENGINEERING REPORTS
----------------------------

     IETF Monthly Report for April, 1996

     1. At the plenary session of the Los Angeles IETF meeting, new IESG
     and IAB members were announced. The current IESG memers are:

                Harald T. Alvestrand     Fred Baker (Chair)
                Scott Bradner            Jeff Burgan
                Joel Halpern             Frank Kastenholz
                Deirdre Kostick          Allison Mankin
                Keith Moore              Mike O'Dell
                Joyce K. Reynolds        Jeff Schiller

        The current IAB members are:

                J Allard                 Brian Carpenter (Chair)
                Steve Bellovin           Jon Crowcroft
                Robert Elz               Elise Gerich
                Erik Huizer              John Klensin
                Bob Moskowitz            Radia Perlman
                Yakov Rekhter            Chris Weider


     2. The next IETF will be meeting in Montreal, Quebec, Canada from
     June 24-28, 1996. If this date looks familiar, it is the same date
     as INET '96! This is not a "joint" meeting per se, but both
     meetings will be held in the Montreal Convention Center, and the
     IETF and INET'96 will permit attendees to attend each others
     sessions (assuming space is available). See the IETF or ISOC Web
     Pages for more information.

     Closing out the year, the IETF will be returning to San Jose,
     California on December 9-13, 1996.Following that, the IETF travels
     to Memphis, Tennessee where Federal Express will be the host. This
     meeting will be held April 7-11, 1997.

     Progress Report for April 1, 1966 through April 31, 1996

     I.  Significant Events

     During April 1996, InterNIC Registration Services assigned the
     following network addresses, and registered domain names to include
     top-level country domains:

                                Assigned    Registered   Country
                                                         Domain(s)

     Network Addresses        16,781,886 *
     Domain Names Registered                  45,102
     Top-level Country Domain(s)                   4     CF - Central
                                                              African
                                                              Republic
                                                         NE - Niger
                                                         MF - Mauritanie
                                                         OM - Oman

            * Note: Allocated for reassignment from the RIPE Registry.

     The voice mail ports were installed and the new telephone script
     was implemented allowing callers to select the section from which
     support is needed.  Received digital telephones to accommodate the
     anticipated operations needs after 15-day final invoices are sent
     out.

     work on the transfer of responsibilities for IP allocation from
     Canada to the InterNIC is continuing.

     The draft IP Allocation document (RFC 1466) was released as a Best
     Current Practice (BCP) and should become official within a few
     weeks.

Internet Monthly Report                                       April 1996


     Draft versions of contact and domain registration templates were
     prepared and are under evaluation.

     CSR Guardian training began in April in preparation for Guardian
     implementation.  Finalized Guardian schema.  Guardian features are
     being added to the hstreg (host registration) application.
     Finished coding and successfully tested the domreg application for
     Guardian.

     Missed report processing was completed for February; backlog should
     be eliminated in May.

     Work continues on Domain editor tool.  The InterNIC Template
     Generator tool was changed to be compatible with version 3.0 of the
     domain registration template; it will now generate a 3.0 template.

     Hostmaster backlog was completely eliminated.

     Generation of new domain name invoices continues.  The backlog was
     reduced to one week.

     The invoice generator for renewal invoices is ready. The process of
     sending out 60-day renewal notices was initiated.

     Development of "payment uploader" is in progress (for transferring
     payment information from the Access database into the main
     database).

     Installed Sparc center 2000, installed Ingres.  Configuration of
     Sun Ultra is in progress.  Rolled out additional Sparc 20s for
     information service machines.

     All information and database files for the rs machine were ported
     to the Auspex 150 NSF server.  The tracking system files were
     successfully transferred to the Auspex 650 NSF server.

     Continued work with Patrick Crispin to allow InterNIC hosting of
     the ROADMAP Internet training series.

     Tom Newell attended the Coalition for Networked Information
     conference on March 25-26.

     Revised and implemented InterNIC Registration Services Home Page.

     During April, new domain requests continued to range between 1,000
     and 2,000+ per day.  Updates ranged from 400 to 800+ a day.
     Applications that do not need human review are processed within a
     day.  Approximately 50% are handled in this manner.  The remaining

     INTERNIC DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES

     In February, we started porting our production servers to Solaris.
     The port of one backup server (ds1.internic.net) was started in
     February and completed in early March.  The port of our primary
     server (ds0.internic.net) was started in late March and completed
     in early April.  During April, we also completed the conversion of
     our third server, so our production servers are all running
     Solaris.

     As noted previously, testing and rebuilds of databases mean that
     each machine was down for an extended period when it is converted.
     The other two servers support all of our user applications, so
     service was always available during the conversion process.

     THE US DOMAIN REGISTRY

     A new policy has been added to the criteria for delegating domain
     names under the US Domain:

        It is the intention that the delegation of third level (for
        example, locality) domain names be wide spread to many
        registries.  It is undesirable for one person or organization to
        manage a large part of the third level names in any particular
        geographic or logical area.

        No individual or organization shall have more than 500
        delegations total in the US Domain as a whole, or more than 50
        delegation in any particuilar second level (for example, a
        state).

     Some of the processing of requests to the US Domain administrator
     is now automated.  In particular, most requests to register names
     in localities already delegated are automatically forwarded to the
     administrator for that locality.

     The US Domain administrator no longer makes direct registrations of
     hosts, and only makes delegations of third or fourth level domain
     names (such as localities).

     To obtain a copy of the list of other delegated localities and
     subdomains not administered by the US Domain Registrar, get the
     file "us-domain-delegated.txt".

MERIT INTERNET ENGINEERING - March
----------------------------------

     This report summarizes March 1996 activities of Merit's Internet
     Engineering group on behalf of the Routing Arbiter (RA) service and
     other projects.

     Several new organizations are now relying on the Routing Arbiter
     project's Route Servers for peering at the NAPs.  At the
     Washington, D.C. NAP (MAE-East), Delphi uses the Route Servers as
     its primary source of routing information for ESnet, PIPEX, DRA
     Net, Capital Area Internet Service (CAIS), IConNet, Netcom, and
     Hyperspace, and is actively migrating as many other peerings as
     possible to use the RSs.

     Tools developed by the Routing Arbiter are now being used along
     with the Internet Routing Registry (IRR) to configure
     RGnet/RAINet's production Cisco routers.  Alan Barrett of
     PIPEX/IAfrica and Randy Bush of RGnet provided valuable feedback on
     RA services at the March meeting of the IETF Routing Policy System
     (RPS) Working Group; their suggestions prompted the Routing Arbiter
     to make immediate changes in the software to improve its usability.
     The RPS Working Group, chaired by Cengiz Alaettinoglu of the RA and

Internet Monthly Report                                       April 1996


     Daniel Karrenberg of the RIPE NCC, is defining the next-generation
     language in which users of the Routing Arbiter Database (RADB) will
     specify the information held in the database, the mechanism by
     which information in the RADB will be distributed to other sites,
     and standard tools which will analyze information in the RADB.  The
     Routing Arbiter would like to thank Barrett, Bush, and other
     members of the Internet community who have provided extremely
     useful feedback on RA services.

     Using many of the suggestions and comments from recent IEPG and
     NANOG meetings, Craig Labovitz has compiled several new Internet
     routing statistics Web pages. See:

                        http://www.ra.net/statistics/

     These pages include real-time graphs of network instability, bar
     charts of the sources of routing instability, snapshots of the
     Route Servers' routing tables, graphs of long-term trends, and
     reports of invalid routing reports and IRR discrepancies.

     In improving the quality and accuracy of these reports, Merit needs
     the help of Internet Service Providers.  The reports are only as
     accurate as the raw data the Route Servers receive in peering
     sessions.  If you are not peering with the Route Servers, we
     encourage you to do so. Your routes will ONLY be used for
     statistics collection purposes (unless you have explicitly
     registered policy in the IRR and indicated that the RA should
     propagate the routes.) To peer with the Route Servers, send mail to
     rs-peer@ra.net.

     The Routing Arbiter wishes to thank the following organizations for
     providing routes for statistics collection and analysis:  ANS,
     Advantis, Aimnet, alpha dot net, Alternet, Argonne, CAIS, CERFnet,
     CWInet, DIGEX, DRA Net, the Defense Research Engineering Network,
     DXnet, Delphi, ESnet, Insnet, IOSnet, IConNet, Interpath, MCI,
     Nacamar Data Communications, NAP.NET, Net Access, Netcom, Netrail,
     PIPEX, SURAnet, Supernet, The Planet, The Well, and US Cyber.

     The Resource Allocation Committee has funded development of Merit's
     Network Statistics Collection and Reporting software package.  The
     goal of the one-year project, managed by Bill Norton, is to develop
     a Web interface that ISPs and other organizations can use to
     collect and display network performance statistics for their
     portion of the Internet.

     Sue Hares, Gerald Winters, Craig Labovitz, Elise Gerich, Dun Liu,
     and Bill Norton attended the 35th IETF in Los Angeles. Norton,
     Gerich, and Liu met with Vern Paxson of Lawrence Berkeley National

     Laboratory and Jamshid Mahdavi of the Pittsburgh Supercomputing
     Center to discuss Paxson's previous research on network
     performance, and to plan for the comparable collection and analysis
     of data for 1996. Gerich also participated in several meetings of
     the Internet Architecture Board.

     The final report for the NSFNET project, titled "NSFNET:  A
     Partnership for High-Speed Networking," is now available on the
     Merit Web pages.  See:

     MERIT INTERNET ENGINEERING - April
     ----------------------------------

     This report summarizes April 1996 activities of Merit's Internet
     Engineering group on behalf of the Routing Arbiter (RA) service and
     other projects.

     A new Merit graphical tool, called ASExplorer, makes it possible to
     explore the real-time AS routing topology and instability of the
     Internet.  The tool generates hourly maps of current NAP stability
     levels, based on the dynamic routing information collected by Route
     Servers at the Network Access Points.  Users select a NAP, click on
     an AS peering with the Route Servers, and follow color-coded links
     to display successive layers of neighbor ASs.  The thicker the line
     linking a Route Server and AS, the greater the number of BGP
     updates, and the greater the instability of routing information at
     the NAP.  Clicking on an AS also displays InterNIC contact
     information for that Autonomous System.  ASExplorer, which was
     developed by Craig Labovitz, requires a frames-capable browser such
     as Netscape 2.0.  See:

                     http://www.ra.net/tools/asexplorer/

     Brian Renaud, Xin Liu, and Jerry Winters of the Routing Arbiter
     Database support team have been working with RADB maintainers--end
     users authorized to modify database records--to remove more than
     4,000 duplicated Route objects from the database.  The project is
     part of a long-term Merit effort to identify, correct, and remove
     inaccurate or obsolete records from the RADB.  To initiate the
     project, the team sent e-mail messages to more than 800 maintainers
     listing Route objects duplicated in another Internet Routing
     Registry (IRR) database or covered by a shorter (less specific)
     aggregate Route object in the RADB.  The staff offered to delete
     the duplicated records on behalf of the maintainer, or send the

     maintainers the duplicated route objects fully prepared for
     deletion, so they could review the deletions and send in the
     transactions themselves.  Depending on the response, the team then
     worked on a case-by-case basis to update or delete the Route
     objects.  The process involved updating maintainer information,
     working with multi-homed ISPs to find appropriate solutions,
     providing tutorials on the RADB and IRR, and finding ways to ensure
     consistency among IRR registries.  The 4,000 deleted objects
     represented roughly ten percent of those registered in the
     database.

     Users can display current information about RADB route duplication
     and coverage for any AS on the Routing Arbiter Web pages:

               http://www.ra.net/cgi-bin/ra/radb-duplicates.pl

     Merit has received a continuation of funding for its IDRP project,
     which is managed by the MITRE Corporation.  Merit's development
     effort for the GateD-IDRP implementation is led by Sue Hares.  In
     this phase of the project, Hares and other Merit staff will
     implement IDRP QOS support for multiple FIBs and priority queuing
     for multiple types of network reachability information.

     Jerry Winters attended the 24th RIPE meeting in Berlin, where he
     presented updates on ASExplorer, the RADB, and RAWhoisd.

UCL
----

     THe main UCL workitem in the last period of Merci sponsored work
     has been the release of SDR 2.2a9 for platforms including SunOS
     Solaris, HPUX, OSF/1, Linux and Win95. This incorporates the
     Session Invitiation Protocol, which allows active setup of
     conferences between participants as well as the "tune in" classic
     session directory style of conference coordination.

     The Robust-Audio Tool has also undergone  further releases.

     We have also started playing with RSVP (the ISI release and Cisco's
     beta release). This is in an environment that includes an ATM
     infrastructure between routers.
