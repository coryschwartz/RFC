     RESOURCE DISCOVERY AND DIRECTORY SERVICE
     ----------------------------------------

        The Internet Research Task Force research group on Resource
        Discovery has been developing and experimenting with the Harvest
        system for the past 1.5 years.

        Harvest provides an integrated set of tools to gather, extract,
        organize, search, cache, and replicate relevant information
        across the Internet.  With modest effort users can tailor
        Harvest to digest information in many different formats, and
        offer custom search services on the Internet.  Moreover, Harvest
        makes very efficient use of network traffic, remote servers, and
        disk space.

        In the past few months we have made significant improvements to
        the system, allowing well-controlled specifications of the
        information gathering workload, much better gathering and
        indexing performance, support for more data formats, more
        sophisticated caching and replication, ports to popular
        platforms, and much more easily installed and used binary
        distributions of the basic system.  At present we are working on
        extending the system to support taxonomies and query routing,
        more complex data models, interfaces with other popular systems
        and products (such as Verity's and WAIS Inc.'s search engines,
        SGML, and SQL search engines), more customizable searching
        schemes, non-textual index/search engines, and a number of
        experiments concerning system scalability.  We are actively
        pursuing collaborative efforts with other projects in all
        sectors - commercial, government, academic, and others.

        Readers can get information about Harvest (including demos,
        papers, software, and documentation) from
        http://harvest.cs.colorado.edu/

INTERNET ENGINEERING REPORTS
----------------------------

     1. Let me remind everyone that the next IETF meeting will be in
        Danvers, Massachusetts (a suburb of Boston) from April 3-7,
        1995. Logistic information has already been posted to the IETF
        Announcement list.

        The summer IETF meeting will be held in Stockholm, Sweden the
        week of July 17-21, 1995. Due to the meeting costs, the IETF
        attendance fee for the Stockholm meeting will be US$300. Hotel
        information has been sent to the Announcement list, and
        attendees are encouraged to make their plane and hotel
        reservations. The IETF Secretariat is NOT accepting
        registrations for the Stockholm meeting at this time.

        Following Stockholm, the IETF will be meeting in Dallas, Texas
        on December 4-8, 1995. Our local host for this meeting is MCI.
        Once all the arrangements have been made, notifications will be
        sent to the IETF Announcement list. Remember that information
        on future IETF meetings can be always be found in the file 0mtg-
        sites.txt which is located on the IETF shadow directories. This
        information can also be viewed from the IETF Home Page on the
        Web. The URL is:

                     http://www.ietf.cnri.reston.va.us


     2. The minutes of the IESG teleconferences have been publicly
        available on the IETF Shadow directories since 1991. These files
        are placed in the /ftp/iesg directory.

        The following IESG minutes have been added:

           January 26, 1995 (iesg.95-01-26)
           February 9, 1995 (iesg.95-02-09)


     3. The IESG approved or recommended the following 10 Protocol
        Actions during the month of February, 1995:

        o  A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4) be published as a Draft
           Standard.

        o  Application of the Border Gateway Protocol in the Internet
           be published as a Draft Standard.

        o  Experience with the BGP-4 protocol be published as an

ANSNET/NSFNET BACKBONE ENGINEERING
----------------------------------

     FEBRUARY BACKBONE TRAFFIC STATISTICS

     The total inbound packet count for the ANSnet (measured using SNMP
     interface counters) was 57,423,075,598 on T3 ENSS interfaces, down
     19.23% from January.  The total packet count into the network
     including all ENSS serial interfaces was 72,065,096,991 down 13.41%
     from January. The decrease is due to the on-going decommissioning
     of the NSFNET backbone service.

     ROUTER FORWARDING TABLE STATISTICS

     The maximum number of destinations announced to ANSnet during
     February was 22,292 up 5.22% from January.

     The number of network destinations configured for announcement to
     the ANSnet but never announced (silent nets) during February was
     23,269

     NEW EBONE-EUROPANET GATEWAY

     Since 1 February the fourth consecutive interconnect arrangement
     between EuropaNET and Ebone has been in operation. As the capacity
     of the previous gateway was insufficient, the new gateway has a
     capacity of 1 Mbps, and will shortly be upgraded to 1.5 Mbps. The
     cost is shared between Ebone and some of DANTE's customers. The
     current arrangement will cover the first 9 months of 1995.

     At the same time DANTE regrets not to have been able so far to
     persuade EUnet to serialize their connection to EuropaNET. DANTE
     has been providing EUnet with a free 64 kbps access, but in
     practice much more capacity is used. Therefore DANTE asked EUnet to
     increase their connection rate accordingly and to serialize the
     connection in October last year. Unfortunately, DANTE can not
     indefinitely offer free and unlimited connectivity to some networks
     while charging others.

     HIGH SPEED PROGRESS

     While the EuroCAIRN study is now in the hands of the EuroCAIRN
     Committee DANTE has already taken the next step on the road to a
     high speed network for European research. DANTE submitted an
     outline proposal under a joint initiative as part of the EC Fourth
     Framework Programme of DG III F and DGXIII C to support the
     European interconnection of national research and university
     networks at 34- 155 Mbps. The initiative is an integral part of the
     existing Call for Proposals for the Information Technologies
     Programme (Esprit) and the Telematics Application Programme. DANTE
     will act as coordinating partner in a consortium together with a
     number of national research networks. A decision on which projects
     will be awarded funding will be made be made in the second half of
     1995. Obviously DANTE is keen to get the opportunity to execute the
     implementation plan it has presented as part of the EuropCAIRN
     report.

     DANTE AT CEBIT

     DANTE is pleased to announce that, by courtesy of DFN, it will be
     present at CeBIT, the leading annual IT event in Hannover, Germany.
     DANTE was invited to share the DFN stand. DANTE will take the
     opportunity to increase visibility of its own activities and
     European research networking in general. In particular DANTE will
     spread the word on its 'high speed' activities so far. DFN and
     DANTE can be found in Hall 22, Stand D36. More information can be
     found on a special www page, URL:

     VIRTUAL PROJECT LIBRARY

     DANTE is taking part in an EC Information Engineering Feasibility
     Project initiated by the French company Matra Marconi Space. The
     project is called Virtual Project Library and it sets out to create
     a mechanism which will enable project participants distributed all
     over Europe working together on a project to access, use and store
     project information over the network. This may sound very familiar
     to the networking community but in the commercial world the

     Internet is not yet the standard information medium, security being
     one major concern. DANTE was invited to join as partner to assess
     and advise on the pan-European networking options and limitations
     for creating such a mechanism. The kick-off meeting for the seven-
     month project took place in February.

     NEW STAFF

     Vincent Berkhout (NL) started work for DANTE on 16 January 1995. He
     will be working as Applications Engineer. Initially he will
     concentrate on directory issues. Vincent graduated as 'Telematics
     Engineer' at the Hogeschool Utrecht in 1992. For his final thesis
     he worked at SURFnet doing research on the technical infrastructure
     of X.500. After that he joined the post-graduate Technology
     Designer program at the University of Twente where he worked as a
     member of the Network Management discipline group.

     INTERNIC DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES

     As of February 28, InterNIC Directory and Database Services took
     over support of some of the services previously supported by
     InterNIC Information Services.  The InfoGuide will be available on
     ds.internic.net (pending resolution of some copyright issues), and
     some popular mailing lists will move as well.

     The scout-report and net-happenings mailing lists have been moved
     to DS machines.  The mailing list transition is causing some load
     problems at the moment (scout-report, for example, has 20,000
     recipients).  We are ordering additional hardware to handle the

     load generated by the mailing lists and we expect their performance
     to be back to normal soon.  The lists are held on a machine named
     dsmail.internic.net, but we have aliases in place so requests sent
     to majordomo@is.internic.net will be handled properly.

     To minimize impact from this changeover on InterNIC users, the name
     is.internic.net has been changed to point to the Directory and
     Database Services machines and we will maintain the same directory
     structure for the IS information that it had on the IS machine.
     Thus users will be able to continue to use URLs and Gopher links to
     files and directories on is.internic.net.  This also means that
     subscription requests for the mailing lists can still be sent to
     majordomo@is.internic.net.

     There are no changes to the existing service offered on the ds
     machines.

     A reminder - if you would like to help the Internet community find
     a resource that you offer, send mail to admin@ds.internic.net and
     we will send information about listing your resource in the

     INTERNIC REGISTRATION SERVICES

     I.  Significant Events

     InterNIC Registration Services assigned over 10,056 network
     addresses and registered over 4,190 domains.  Three top level
     domains were registered this month for Anguilla (AI), Cote d'Ivoire
     (CI), and Guam (GU).

     Knowledgenet, Inc. has filed suit against Network Solutions and
     David L. Boone over the name knowledgenet.com. Network Solutions
     has engaged outside counsel to represent us in this suit. Due to a
     continuance, the next court filing has been pushed back to early
     March. This case could establish precedence that refutes InterNIC
     Registration Service's current policy of first-come first served by
     binding trademarked names with a domain name.

     During the month of February, increased volume of requests has
     increased the backlog from 10 days processing time to 15 days
     processing time.  There are approximately 5,000 new domain requests
     in the queue to be processed.  Adjustments in processes/staff are
     being made, as well as ordering additional equipment to continue to
     accommodate the tremendous growth currently being experienced by
     Registration Services.

     NETSTATION
     ==========

     Recent work on the Netstation Project has focused on end-to-end
     protocols which facilitate efficient implementation.  Specifically,
     we have been working on the design and implementation of a
     transport protocol, DTP, that is optimized for fast intra-LAN round
     trip times, and the design of internet protocol mechanisms which
     would facilitate high performance wide-area transport protocols.




Cooper                                                         [Page 13]

Internet Monthly Report                                    February 1995


     A draft document describing the transport protocol, DTP, will be
     complete as results of the protcol implementation become available
     to support, or refute, the protocol design choices.  A document
     describing mechanisms to support a zero-copy internet checksum is
     also in preparation.

     DTP: A HIGH-PERFROMANCE TRANSPORT PROTOCOL

     The properties of data transfer fidelity, order preservation and
     execute once-only semantics are provided through the physical
     design of a system bus and are taken for granted by software
     developers.  Those properties are not provided by general-purpose
     networks. To successfully control a device across a network, those
     properties must be explicitly provided via protocols.  A reliable
     transport protocol can ensure data fidelity, preserve ordering and
     provide at-most-once delivery of RPC messages.

     The rate at which RPC messages can be issued by a source host to a
     destination host is bound from above by the rate at which the
     source transport layer can send a message and receive its
     acknowledgement from the destination transport layer.  Since
     commands to devices are often serially dependent, where the result
     of one command must be known before the next can be issued,
     effective substitution of a network for a system bus requires
     achieving very short RTTs in the transport layer.

     OVERVIEW OF A DEVICE TRANSPORT PROTOCOL

     A transport-layer protocol that is designed specificly for the
     control of devices over a network differs from a general-purpose
     transport-layer protocol such as TCP.  The principal objectives are
     to satisfy required semantic communications properties for a
     Netstation device (NVD) operation while minimizing protocol-induced
     delays, both in the transport and application layers.

     Other transport-layer protocols have been defined that address
     somewhat similar application requirements.  Perhaps chief among
     these are VMTP and the Reliable Data Protocol (RDP). The reasons
     for not using TCP for the control of NVDs echo the reasons that RDP
     was developed.  Quoting from the RDP document RFC 908: "TCP is best
     suited to an environment where there is no obvious demarcation of
     data in a communications exchange.  Much of the difficulty in
     developing a TCP implementation stems from the complexity of
     supporting this general byte-stream transfer, and thus a
     significant amount of complexity can be avoided by using another
     protocol.  This is not just an implementation consideration, but
     also one of efficiency."




Cooper                                                         [Page 14]

Internet Monthly Report                                    February 1995


     The architecture of DTP builds on concepts found in VMTP, RDP and
     TCP, but is designed to take maximal advantage of the expected
     Netstation environment.  In particular, emerging gigabit LANs
     provide an environment that is friendly to operation of a reliable
     transport protocol in several ways: (a) the delay*bandwidth product
     is generally shorter than a packet, (b) maximum packet lifetime is
     of little concern, (c) the cost of routing a packet is small and
     bandwidth is plentiful, and (d) packets are protected by a hardware
     checksum.

     A judgement was made that the majority of connections between
     devices and their owners are likely to be intra-LAN.  If one
     accepts this premise, special attention should be paid in the
     transport layer to minimizing RTT for this class of traffic.  DTP
     identifies messages sent across intra-LAN connections, which allows
     different flow-control and processing algorithms to be used for
     intra-LAN traffic.

     The design of DTP focuses on minimizing the end-to-end delay when a
     source application sends a message to a destination application.
     This is distinct from attempting to maximize bandwidth utilization
     or to minimize long-term transport-layer overhead.  In determining
     DTP's features and formats, uppermost was the consideration of how
     to define the protocol to minimize the RTT between transmission of
     a reliable message and its acknowledgement.

     ZERO-COPY PROTOCOL STACKS AND CHECKSUMMING

     A primary source of overhead in protocol processing can be
     attributed to operations that read and/or write all, or most, of
     the bytes in a packet.  Examples of these operations are (1) digest
     or encryption security functions, (2) buffering and copying between
     different protocol layers (network -vs- transport) or
     implementation layers (application -vs- operating system), or (3)
     data fidelity checksum algorithms.

     A protocol implementation that eliminates those per-byte costs is
     referred to as a zero-copy protocol stack; the ability to perform a
     particular operation without the per-byte overhead is a zero-copy
     operation.  We are concerned about checksum functionality, and
     mechanism to support zero-copy checksuming in the next-generation
     TCP/IP protocol stack (IPv6, TCPv6 and UDPv6).

     The principal advantage of a zero-copy stack is increased
     performance.  A 20MHz Myricom LANai interface processor can scan
     application buffers for a packet to send, prepare that packet,
     transmit it with CRC and service a send-done event in 51 machine
     instructions.  As a result, a source application running on a



Cooper                                                         [Page 15]

Internet Monthly Report                                    February 1995


     SPARCstation-10 can send IP/UDP RPCs individually, at a rate of
     70K/second across the network into a destination application.  This
     performance is a result of (1) a shared-memory interface between
     application and network interface, and more importantly (2) the use
     of the zero-copy link-layer checksum provided by hardware
     interface.

     Only in cases where both the source and destination nodes are on
     the same LAN can end-to-end data protection can be provided by a
     link-layer checksum, rather than a combination of network and
     transport checksums. A high level of performance is possible
     because packets are not copied and neither the network layer nor
     the transport-layer need to scan them to calculate checksums.
     However, this zero-copy technique does not easily extend to cover
     situations where source and destination nodes are on different
     LANs.  This sharply restricts the domain within which the better
     performance is available.

     This month the ATOMIC LAN replaced the Ethernet connection on three
     office workstations (Sun SPARC 10/41, 10/51, and 20/50) at ISI. The
     Ethernet to these hosts is completely disconnected, and they have
     been running continuously for three weeks. They are currently
     gatewayed through a Sun SPARC-2 to the division Ethernet, including
     the MBONE.  This will be replaced with the ATM gateway under

     development. We expect that over the next two months a total of 65
     workstations will be on the ATOMIC LAN, and the Ethernet will exist
     to support only those hosts for which Myricom interfaces have not
     yet been implemented.

     ATOMIC-2 APPLICATIONS DEMONSTRATION

     PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine) [1] supports distributed and
     parallel computing applications. PVM 3.3 has been installed on the
     ATOMIC LAN.  We measured the communication bandwidth and latency
     between two PVM tasks on this LAN, between two Sun SPARC 20/50
     hosts. The task-task latency has a 1.15 ms overhead (of which 0.7
     ms is ATOMIC LAN overhead), the remainder determined by the packet
     length and bandwidth. The bandwidth is 25-30 Mbps for 2 Kbyte
     packets, and drops to 10 Mbps for 0.5 Kbyte packets. TCP can reach
     peak bandwidth 50 Mbps in the ATOMIC LAN, the PVM's peak bandwidth
     is lower due to the extra memory copy between the PVM buffer and
     user data buffer.

     In order to explore the high ATOMIC link-layer bandwidth and avoid
     the kernel protocol stack overhead, our next step is to improve PVM
     performance by implementing PVM message passing routines using the
     Myrinet API, instead of TCP.

     ATOMIC-2 FILE SERVER

     We are continuing our investigation of NFS performance, in order to
     determine the ATOMIC-2 File Server design. Our measurements
     indicate that NFS write bandwidth is bounded by both the Sun RPC
     protocol that commonly implements it, and internal interactions
     with the BSD file system.

     RPC limits the bandwidth because only a single request/response can
     be outstanding to any given process.  Sun's implementation of NFS
     uses multiple processes to effectively overcome this limitation on
     an Ethernet.  On the higher bandwidth ATOMIC network, the overhead
     of context switching and demultiplexing packets to these processes
     limits the bandwidth to less than observed TCP or UDP user-user
     bandwidth.  Essentially, the low bandwidth solution is bottlenecked
     in comparison to the high bandwidth network.  We believe it would
     be more efficient to have a single process fill a sliding window
     than use multiple processes doing RPC.

     The BSD file system also interacts with NFS, particularly when
     writing disk blocks.  When a file is read, then a request for the

Internet Monthly Report                                    February 1995


     block the user is interested in is issued immediately, potentially
     along with several read-ahead blocks.  This pattern is fairly
     predictable, and maps closely with the read calls that the user
     makes.  When a disk block is written, it is written to the BSD file
     cache, and flushed out to the server when the paging system needs
     one of the disk cache pages, or notices that the page has been
     dirty for some time.  A block written by a user can sit in the file
     cache for some time before the page daemon flushes it to the
     server.  Furthermore, the paging daemon and the user writes are
     entirely disconnected; the pattern of writes the user issues and
     the order and timing of the blocks that are flushed to the server
     by the page daemon are basically independent.  The combination
     implies that it is harder to pipeline write requests than read
     requests.  (There are good reasons to cache file writes, notably
     not bothering the server with writing short-lived temporary files,
     but it impacts NFS performance as well.)

     We are investigating strategies to both implement NFS using a
     higher bandwidth transport protocol and to pipeline writes more
     effectively.

     ATOMIC-2 APPLICATION BANDWIDTH ACCESS EXPERIMENTS

     Previously most of the performance measurement tools in use on the
     Atomic-2 project have made use of the standard SunOS API, the
     socket interface, which provides user programs access to TCP/IP and
     UDP/IP.  To develop an understanding of how bottlenecks might be
     avoided, some of these applications are being augmented to
     optionally use the Myrinet API, which will allow the user program
     to send raw Myrinet packets and bypass the kernel.

     Using a pre-release version of Myricom's dual-path driver, the IP
     traffic and Myrinet API traffic have been able to run
     simultaneously on the ATOMIC LAN. The performance of running
     simultaneous IP and API traffic is critical in assisting our high-
     performance protocol research. In our experiments, the IP traffic
     and API traffic were running in the same direction between two Sun
     SPARC 20/50s connected through one 8-port switch. We found that the
     performance dropped by 10-30%, even though we were running only one
     type of traffic at a time through the dual-path driver.

     Two possible reasons for the decrease in throughput are additional
     overhead due to interface demultiplexing and lack of sufficient
     buffer space (because the space is fragmented into two packet
     queues).

     ATOMIC-2 SECURITY

     Last month the performance analysis of MD5 was completed. This
     month we began analysis and selection of alternatives that can
     support ATOMIC LAN bandwidth. This analysis is proceeding with MD2.
     Initial analytical results indicate that MD2 should run 20 times
     slower than MD5, which is too slow for the ATOMIC LAN (38 Mbps on a
     SPARC 20/50, where UDP is 50 Mbps). Measurements indicate that the
     current optimization of MD2 runs 30 times slower than MD5; because
     a speedup of only 50% is possible, this work is not being pursued.
     We are instead evaluating other authentication algorithms more
     suitable to high-speed implementation in software and/or hardware.

     After the January release of RSVP version 1, a number of useful
     comments came in which we have incorporated.  Most of these
     suggestions dealt with the portability of the code.  The most
     extensive of these came from MIT which ported RSVP to DEC alpha
     machines and Intel based PC's.  These changes allow RSVP to run on
     64 bit architectures such as the alpha and "little-endian" machines
     such as the PC and the alpha.  We are testing the interoperability
     of these versions.  Other input came from Bill Nowicki at Silicon
     Graphics who was porting RSVP to SGI machines.

     Another remaining issue for the complete version 1 RSVP is the
     support of tunnels.  Such a tunnel exists between the Xerox PARC
     DARTnet router and most of the PARC hosts.  We are using UDP
     encapsulation on a well-known multicast IP address to communicate
     between hosts and routers.  This is now working and we are able to
     make reservations both into and out of Xerox PARC hosts.

     We are preparing an RSVP Web page.  The page is ready and the
     appropriate links will be installed shortly on the ISI home page.

MERIT/NSFNET ENGINEERING
------------------------

     This report summarizes recent activities of Merit's Internet
     Engineering and Network Management groups on behalf of the Routing
     Arbiter (RA) Project and the NSFNET Backbone Service Project.

     Merit has sent a 60-day termination notice for the NSFNET Backbone
     Service to ANS.  The backbone ENSS's will be turned off at midnight
     on April 30 in each respective time zone.  Merit and the regionals
     have enjoyed a successful collaboration for many years, and we look
     forward to continued joint successes in the brave new world of
     post-NSFNET!

     Many regionals are obtaining interregional Internet service from
     Network Service Providers, and have moved off the T3 NSFNET
     backbone.  Merit will now gradually discontinue the T1 "safety net"
     that has backed up regional connections to the T3 NSFNET for
     several years.

     The Routing Arbiter Project's Route Server at MAE-East has begun to
     pass actual routes to its peers.  Among the AS's receiving routes
     are MCI, PIPEX, and Net 99.  Many thanks to these AS's for helping
     move the new technology along!

     Merit has ported PGP version 2.6 into the RIPE routing registry
     software.  The new privacy feature makes it possible to use PGP's
     popular cryptographic algorithm to authenticate data submitted
     through e-mail to the Routing Arbiter Database (RADB) and other



Cooper                                                         [Page 24]

Internet Monthly Report                                    February 1995


     RIPE-181-style registries.  To implement PGP, simply enter 'PGP-
     FROM my.email.address' in the RADB Maintainer object's 'auth:'
     field.  You then use a public domain PGP client to sign your e-mail
     with your secret key.  The RADB software uses your public key to
     verify your signature.  The PGP encryption schema is known to be
     very difficult to break.  PGP can also provide confidentiality by
     encrypting any data in such a way that only the recipient can read
     the message.  For more information, contact Laurent Joncheray at
     Merit (lpj@merit.edu.)

     As part of the process of replacing the NSFNET Policy Routing
     Database (PRDB) with the RADB, the RADB has been populated with
     RIPE-181-style Maintainer and AS Objects for all Autonomous Systems
     known to the PRDB.  NACRs are now being checked against this
     information rather than the PRDB.  In addition, the list of
     contacts who are authorized to submit NACRs has been moved to the
     RADB.  The NACR contact data has long been queryable using the old
     command:

       whois -h prdb.merit.edu 'contact <AS_number>'

     Now when you issue that command, you receive as output the RADB
     Maintainer object that includes your contact information, along
     with a message explaining how to update the Maintainer object.  The
     following new command is equivalent and produces the same output:

         whois -h whois.ra.net 'MAINT-AS<AS_number>'

     For AS690, you would type:

         whois -h whois.ra.net MAINT-AS690

     Similarly, network data has long been queryable using the old
     command:

         whois -h prdb.merit.edu '<net_number>'

     Now when you issue that command, you receive as output the RADB
     Route object that describes that network.  The new, equivalent
     command is:

         whois -h whois.ra.net <net_number>

     During the next phase of the PRDB --> RADB transition, the two
     databases will run in parallel, and NACRs will be used as input to
     both the PRDB and RADB.  In the final phase, users will be able to
     submit RIPE-style Route objects instead of NACRs.  For further
     information about the PRDB --> RADB transition, see

     Jessica Yu of Merit has been working with ISI's Cengiz Alaettinoglu
     to extend RIPE-181 to specify AS path expressions in routing
     policies.  Merit's Andy Adams and Alaettinoglu are modifying
     RtConfig, a router configuration tool, to generate configuration
     files supporting these extensions.

     Merit has received a continuation of FAA funding for its joint
     government/industry IDRP project, which is managed by the MITRE
     Corporation.  Merit's effort is led by Sue Hares, who co-chairs the
     IETF Inter-Domain Routing Working Group.  The project's Gated-IDRP
     version 1.1, which supports advanced policy descriptions, is
     expected to be released in April.  In the next phase of the
     project, Hares and other Merit staff will implement a mobile
     Boundary Information System in IDRP.

     Under a grant from NSF, Craig Labovitz continues development of the
     Multi-Threaded Routing Toolkit (MRT), which provides a simple,
     extensible platform for developing and debugging routing protocols
     and routing code.  The Toolkit comprises a set of generic libraries
     that can be used to build small executables and scripts that
     perform complex routing tasks quickly and efficiently.  The MRT
     architecture uses the multiple-thread technology available in the
     Sun operating system to take full advantage of the speed and power
     of multi-processor machines.  For more information, contact
     Labovitz at labovit@merit.edu.

     MIDNET INTRODUCES "A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO THE INTERNET" SEMINAR
     MIDnet's first "Practical Guide to the Internet" seminar was held
     during February.The goal of the seminar was to introduce newcomers
     to the advantages of the Internet through real-world examples, and
     to remove the mystic of the Internet by providing information in
     layman's terms. The seminar was well attended, with an audience
     that consisted of representatives from both the business and
     educational communities.

     Plans are currently underway to offer this seminar in additional
     locations within the MIDnet region.

     MIDNET MEMBER MEETING
     During February, MIDnet representatives met with a state educators
     to determine their Internet needs and goals. The meeting was
     attended by representatives from K-12 as well as representatives
     from institutes of higher education. MIDnet provided information on
     the current state of its network in conjunction with the NSF
     transition, and distributed a document which described and provided
     pointers to Internet resources of particular interest to educators.

     MIDNET'S INTERFACE TO POPULAR INTERNET RESOURCES
     Activities are underway to expand the number of resources accessed
     via MIDnet's WWW server. Resources currently enjoying popularity
     include the Net-Happenings Mail List and Diane Kovac's Directory of
     Scholarly Electronic Conferences, for which MIDnet provides a WWW
     view with search and browse capabilities.  MIDnet's NIC has

     identified two additional Internet resources which provide valuable
     information to the Internet community. Agreements are currently
     being drafted which will allow MIDnet to implement its interface to
     these resources.

UCL
----

     The major event of the last month was the setting up of a 4 nation
     demonstration of IP Mbone based multimedia conferencing ofver the
     PNO trial. The PNOs (Public Network Operators)  of the EU (European
     Union) have provided a trial 34Mbps ATM network for the current
     year for research projects such as MICE. We configured a set of
     mbone suns and Ciscos to use this between INRIA in france, the G7
     summit meeting in Brussels, RUS in Germany and UCL in London. The
     configuration has been reported elsewhere, and a detailed report on
     the setup and performance will be available fairly soon. A draft is
     available on request from J.Crowcroft@cs.ucl.ac.uk, however, the
     hypotheses we have formed about what worked and what didn't are not
     completely proven yet.

     Suffice it to say for now that it was a major success, using just
     about every piece of networking technology anyone could think of.
     The net ran uninterrupted (and unsupported) for 3 days, with only
     the partial failure of an ATM/SMDS interworking unit dropping one
     site off the demo about half way through.

     There are some interesting lessons for how IP and Internet based
     applications have to be configured to run this, and over the next 3
     months, we shall be experimenting further to get a better
     scientific confirmation of our hypotheses noted above.

     Also, 2 papers were submitted to ACM SIGCOMM '95.
