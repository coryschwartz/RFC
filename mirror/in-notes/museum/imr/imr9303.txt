INTERNET ARCHITECTURE MESSAGE

     THE NEW WORLD ORDER

     The November 1992 IETF meeting adopted the outline of a new
     organizational structure for the IAB/IETF, to accomodate continued
     growth and new consituencies.  This outline was documented in RFC-
     1396 ["The Process for Organization of Internet Standards Working
     Group (POISED)", S. Crocker, RFC-1396, January 1993].  The Board of
     Trustees of the Internet Society accepted the revisions in December
     1992, and transition to the new plan began.

     One of the key effects of this change (known colloquially as the
     "New World Order" or NWO) is to install a nominations process to
     select new IAB and IESG members.  IAB and IESG members will serve 2
     year terms, with half of the positions on each board subject to
     re-selection each year.  The Internet Society Board of Trustees
     will review and ratify the new IAB nominations, and the IAB will
     review and ratify the new IESG nominations.

     Following the November IETF meeting, a Nomination Committee was
     selected by a random drawing from volunteering IETF attendees.
     Jeff Case served as the chair. Roughly half of the existing members
     of the IAB and IESG put their positions up for renomination; the
     other half will continue to serve with a remaining term of one
     year.

     At the Thursday evening open plenary session of the IETF meeting in
     Columbus Ohio, the Nomination Committee reported its results.  The
     "old" IAB was able to caucus in person and by telephone, and
     approved the new IESG nominations.  The ISOC Board of Trustees was
     able to approve the new IAB members via email.  Hence, the NWO is
     now fully in effect.

     THE NEW IAB

     For the next year, the IAB membership will be as follows:

          Bob Braden          (USC/ISI)
         *Elise Gerich        (Merit)
          Christian Huitema   (INRIA)
          Steve Kent          (BBN)
          Tony Lauck          (DEC)
          Barry Leiner        (USRA)
         *Jun Murai           (WIDE)
          Jon Postel          (USC/ISI)
         *Yakov Rekhter       (IBM Research)

Internet Monthly Report                                       March 1993


         *John Romkey         (ELF)
         *Dave Sincoskie      (Bellcore)
          *Mike StJohns       (ARPA)

     The names marked with a "*" are the new members.  The IAB will
     choose a chair from among its members.  The chair of the IETF,
     Phill Gross, sits on the IAB as an ex officio member.  The IRSG
     chair may also be ex officio; at present, however, it is filled by
     Jon Postel, who is a regular member of the IAB.

     THE NEW IESG

     The new membership of the IESG is as follows:

        *Phill Gross (ANS)            IETF/IESG chair

        *Brewster Kahle (WAIS Inc.)   Applications
         Erik Huizer (SURFnet)        Applications

        *David Crocker (SGI)          Service Applications

        *Allison Mankin (NRL)         Transport

        *Marshall Rose (Consultant)   Network Management

         Robert Hinden (Sun Microsystems) Routing

        *Stev Knowles (FTP Software)  Internet
         David Piscitello (Bellcore)  Internet

         Joyce Reynolds (USC/ISI)     User Services

        *Scott Bradner (Harvard)      Operational Requirements
         Bernhard Stockman (SUNET/NORDUnet/EBONE NOC)
                                      Operational Requirements

         Stephen Crocker (TIS)        Security

        *Lyman Chapin (BBN)           Standards Management

        * = new or reconfirmed members

         (Note: Prior to the Nominating Committee's deliberations,
         the IESG decided to divide the Transport Services Area
         into the Service Applications and Transport Areas. Service
         Applications will include protocols used by other
         applications, and not directly by users. Examples include
         DNS and NTP.)

         On behalf of the IAB, the IESG, and the Internet community,
         we want to express some well deserved thanks and appreciation
         to the IAB and IESG members who decided not to continue:

         Phil Almquist, Dave Borman, James (Chuck) Davin, and
         Russ Hobby of the IESG, and Hans-Werner Braun, Vint Cerf,
         Lyman Chapin, and Dan Lynch of the IAB.

         Serving on the IAB and IESG is generally a volunteer job,
         and as these folks know all too well, it requires a serious
         investment of time.  They have served us all well and will
         be missed.  They deserve our thanks.

         IAB MEETING

         The IAB held an open meeting at the IETF meeting in
         Columbus, OH, on Tuesday evening March 30, 1993.  A single
         topic was discussed: the proposals for liaison between the
         Internet Society/IETF standards process and the International
         Standards Organization (ISO).  The pros and cons of these
         proposals were frankly and thoroughly discussed by the
         IAB and some 30 attendees.  No decisions were made.  Cerf,
         President of ISOC, will publish pertinent documentation
         as RFCs.

     RESOURCE DISCOVERY AND DIRECTORY SERVICE
     ----------------------------------------

        The Internet Research Task Force Research Group on Resource
        Discovery and Directory Service has reformed as a small group of
        researchers addressing a focused set of problems.  We have
        written a paper about our current directions, which is now
        available by anonymous FTP from ftp.cs.colorado.edu, in the file
        pub/cs/techreports/schwartz/PostScript/RD.ResearchProblems.ps.Z
        (compressed PostScript) or in the file
        pub/cs/techreports/schwartz/ASCII/RD.ResearchProblems.txt.Z
        (compressed ASCII).  Here is the title/abstract:

          C. M. Bowman, P. B. Danzig and M. F. Schwartz.
          Research Problems for Scalable Internet Resource
          Discovery. Technical Report CU-CS-643-93, Department
          of Computer Science, University of Colorado, Boulder,
          Colorado, March 1993.

        Abstract:

          Over the past several years, a number of information
          discovery and access tools have been introduced in the
          Internet, including Archie, Gopher, Netfind, and WAIS.
          These tools have become quite popular, and are helping
          to redefine how people think about wide area network
          applications.  Yet, they are not well suited to supporting
          the future information infrastructure, which will be
          characterized by enormous data volume, rapid growth in
          the user base, and burgeoning data diversity.  In this
          paper we indicate trends in these three dimensions, and
          survey problems these trends will create for current
          approaches.  We then suggest several promising directions
          of future resource discovery research, along with some
          initial results from projects carried out by members of
          the Internet Research Task Force Research Group on
          Resource Discovery and Directory Service.

ANSNET/NSFNET BACKBONE ENGINEERING
----------------------------------

     Network Status Summary
     ======================

     Following a last minute problem report during AIX 3.2 testing, the
     deployment of the AIX 3.2 operating system on the T3 routers is now
     tentatively scheduled to begin on April 16, 1993.  The first
     release of AIX 3.2 will increase the on-card forwarding table
     capacity to support 12,000 destinations, and the subsequent release
     of AIX 3.2 software scheduled for May-June will increase the
     forwarding table capacity to support 25,000 destinations, with no
     hardware changes required.

     ANS is now testing BGP4 in Gated and we have invited router vendors
     to join us in interoperability testing.  Vendors may establish TCP
     sessions to a BGP4 ANSnet router over the network.  We will also
     support vendors that want to bring equipment to the private ANS
     wide area test network.  The Gated plan is described in more detail
     below.  No new rcp_routed routing software changes were
     administered on the ANSnet during the month of March.

     Development of the new higher performance RS960 T3 card proceeded
     in March.  This adapter (FDDI/T3) supports full HSSI bandwidth, and
     will route IP datagrams at speeds in excess of 40KPPS.

     Backbone Traffic and Routing Statistics
     =======================================

     The total inbound packet count for the network (measured using SNMP
     interface counters) was 30,956,493,834 on T3 ENSS interfaces, up
     14.7% from February.  The total packet count into the network
     (including all ENSS serial interfaces was 34,175,829,718.

     As of March 31, the number of networks configured in the Merit
     Policy Routing Database was 10493 for the T3 backbone.  Of these,
     2194 were never announced to the T3 backbone (e.g. silent nets).
     The maximum number of networks announced to the T3 backbone during
     the month (from samples collected every 15 minutes) was 7750, up
     9.5% from February.  Average announced networks on 3/31 were 7690.

     AIX 3.2 Migration Plan Status
     =============================

     The T3 backbone software upgrade to support the AIX 3.2 operating
     system was originally scheduled to be begin on April 2nd, at 23:00
     local time.  However a software problem was identified and the
     deployment has been delayed until April 17.  The deployment is
     scheduled to proceed as originally planned on April 17 instead of
     April 2nd.  A revised postscript file illustrating the phased
     deployment at each POP CNSS and adjacent ENSS is located on
     ftp.ans.net in /pub/info/aix32dpmap.ps and may be summarized as
     follows:

     Phase I    (April 17) - Washington D.C.
     Phase II   (April 17) - Seattle/Denver, San Francisco/Los Angeles
     Phase III  (April 24) - Greensboro/Atlanta, Houston/St. Louis
     Phase IV   (May 1)    - Hartford/New York City, Cleveland/Chicago

     Growth in Destination Networks
     ==============================

     As described in the February '93 engineering report, the interface
     forwarding tables on the ANSnet routers are currently configured to
     support 10K destinations.  In the near term, microcode changes will
     be deployed with the first AIX 3.2 build to support improved
     address compression in the forwarding tables which will support 12K
     destinations. A subsequent AIX 3.2 software build will be released
     in the May-June timeframe that will support 25,000 destinations in
     the on-card forwarding tables.

     Gated, BGP4 and CIDR Progress
     =============================

     Dennis Ferguson is now testing BGP4 support in Gated.  ANS has
     extended invitations to router vendors to test BGP4
     interoperability with the Gated implementation.  A router running
     this software is accessible on the public network and vendors may
     establish TCP sessions to this machine.  ANS will also support
     vendors that wish to bring their BGP4 compatible equipment to test
     on our wide area test network.

     BGP4 within Gated will support CIDR aggregation.  The kernel,
     microcode and routing daemon support for CIDR is expected to reduce
     the rate of growth in the number of on-card routes.  ANSnet will
     configure to receive and redistribute aggregated routes to other
     networks that support BGP4.  ANSnet will also perform proxy
     aggregation for networks that are not running BGP4.

Internet Monthly Report                                       March 1993


     The Gated that is being developed for ANSnet is intended to operate
     as a compatible replacement for rcp_routed.  Initially it will
     support the ANSnet/NSFnet IGP (called SLSP, or "simple link state
     protocol", in the implementation), BGP versions 2, 3 and 4 and EGP
     version 2.  We will also include RIP versions 1 and 2 in the build
     in case this is useful at customer sites, and could include OSPF as
     well for the same purpose if the routers could be made to support
     local net multicasting.

     Gated provides complete on-the-fly reconfigurability.  That is, new
     configuration files with arbitrary changes may be installed, and
     Gated can be signaled to re-read them.  Gated will then adjust its
     running state to match the new configuration with no interruption
     of already-established but unchanged routing sessions.  This should
     allow network reconfiguration to be done with little or no
     interruption of network service.  The Gated implementation of SLSP
     provides compatibility with the rcp_routed IGP over point-to-point
     links and adds support for broadcast subnets.

     Gated's BGP, in addition to handling more modern versions of the
     protocol than rcp_routed, has a number of features and enhancements
     including interoperability with IBGP used by rcp_routed.  A
     different algorithm for resolving immediate next hops is used,
     allowing the one-gateway-per-AS restriction to be relaxed.  The
     algorithm for importing external routes has also changed.  While
     rcp_routed distributes all routes it learns from an external
     neighbor to all other internal neighbors (even if those routes
     won't be used because a better preference route exists), Gated only
     distributes external routes internally if they are equally or more
     preferred than any existing route to the same destination.  This
     reduces the amount of state the routers maintain substantially in
     the normal case, at the expense of a longer transient when a first
     preference route is withdrawn.

     The Gated BGP supports timers on both the incoming and outgoing
     announcements.  Incoming timers constrain the rate at which changes
     to a neighbor's advertisements are believed and propagated into the
     system.  For example, setting the incoming timer to 60 seconds
     means that only one change for a particular route would be
     propagated every minute.  This is meant to be used mostly as an
     emergency means of constraining the load from announcements by
     neighbors who have gone unstable.  The outgoing timer delays the
     propagation of changes out to neighbors.  For example, setting the
     outgoing timer to 10 seconds on an external peer would delay the
     advertisement of internal changes for 10 seconds.  This is meant to
     be used to cover up internal transients which will occur when a
     primary route is withdrawn but the secondary route to the same
     destination has not yet been advertised internally.  If the

     withdrawal-insertion occurs within the 10 second interval the
     external neighbor will only see a change, not an outage.

     Gated policy is substantially more flexible than rcp_routed's.  We
     can advertise a true default route to neighbors via BGP.  While
     rcp_routed can only apply outgoing policy based on neighbor AS,
     Gated can in addition apply policy by network, full AS path or any
     combination.  Gated can apply policy to incoming IBGP, for example
     allowing us to omit some networks from the forwarding tables on
     some ENSS's.  Aggregation policy can be configured.  With BGP 4 we
     can allow neighbors to advertise subnet routes to an ENSS to get
     the next hop router right, but not propagate those routes into
     internal routing.  We will be fully free to configure multiple
     gateways to the same AS, and/or to use external metrics received on
     BGP connections to choose the appropriate exit for destinations
     within a neighbor AS.  We will be able to import and propagate a
     customer's subnets when they have multiple sites using subnets of
     the same network number connected to our backbone.

     Gated can in principle use RIP, or static routing, or even OSPF to
     obtain customer routing, giving us additional flexibility with
     end-user customer configuration.  While Gated currently lacks the
     ability to associate an external AS with such routes to allow our
     current policy methods to operate, the additional policy language
     required to do this has been designed and is scheduled for
     implementation.

     Associated with gated is a program ("gdc") which provides an
     operational interface for starting and stopping the daemon, signal
     delivery and other functions.  This is a better way to manipulate
     Gated from shell scripts and the like since error detection is more
     reliable.

     Rcp_routed Routing Software Changes
     ===================================

     There were no new changes to the rcp_routed software on the T3
     network during March.  There are some changes planned for April
     including support for the planned migration from AIX 3.1 to AIX 3.2
     software including multipath forwarding, and generation of third
     party routes.  Release notes for rcp_routed are available for
     anonymous ftp in:

     ftp.ans.net:/pub/info/t3-rcp_routed/Release-Notes

     Routing Stability Measured on the T3 Network
     ============================================

     Internal routing stability measurements are made by monitoring
     short term disconnect times (disconnects of five minutes duration
     or less).  During February the overall stability approached 99% (no
     internal disconnects in any part of the network 99% of the time)
     and all individual nodes reported 99.8% stability or better.
     Overall stability in March was down to 97.5% or 99.1% excluding
     instability during the configuration windows.

     E206 (CERN - Geneva, Switzerland) was the most unstable node with
     recurring circuit problems.  E206 saw 1 hour and 29 minutes of
     instability outside of the configuration window.  E205 and C51 were
     used as test sites for AIX 3.2 deployment before becoming full
     production nodes.  These saw about 1 hour each of instability
     outside of the configuration windows.  The remaining 84 nodes
     reported less than 21 minutes of instability (99.96% stability or
     better) excluding the configuration windows with 61 reporting
     better than 99.99% stability (under 4:48).

     When the configuration window is included, there was over 18 hours
     of instability (where any one node was disconnected).  Several new
     nodes were brought on line this month.  This tends to lengthen
     configuration runs.  Some circuit testing at E206 was performed
     during the configuration window.  There were some router card
     failures which resulted in card replacements during the
     configuration window.  A few nodes were upgraded to AIX 3.2.  Some
     testing was done on AIX 3.2 at new installations prior to going
     into full production.  Three production nodes and one new
     installation reported 2 hours to 3:43 of instability (99.75-99.5%
     stability).  18 nodes reported 1-2 hours of instability. The
     remaining 68 nodes reported less than 1 hour of instability during
     the configuration runs (99.86% stable or better).  Reducing the
     impact of the configuration runs is a near term goal.

     External route flaps were measured by collecting IBGP updates with
     the unreachable attribute at an internal router between Feb 28
     19:05:14 UTC and Mar 31 20:38:21 UTC.  During this period 200,041
     updates were received from 615 distinct AS paths.  These updates
     contained 818,812 network numbers (about 4 networks per update on
     average).  The were 4,048 distinct network numbers (an average of
     202 unreachables per flapping network number).  The most unstable
     network flapped 4,786 times (once every 9.3 minutes on average over
     the course of one month).  On average 269 updates with unreachables
     were received per hour, withdrawing an average of about 1,100 route
     per hour.  There were 17% fewer updates, and 38% more routes
     withdrawn than in February. The 60% increase in the number of

     routes per update may indicate less flapping by end systems, and
     more flapping by transit systems compared with the February
     results.

     SNMP Public Community Views
     ===========================

     ANS has always provided a read-only SNMP community on ENSS and
     selected CNSS routers to ANS customers and NSFNET regional techs.
     This SNMP access provides a useful window into technical aspects of
     ANSNet, allows customers to better manage their external
     connectivity and is an invaluable aid when debugging connectivity
     problems.

     Until recently we permitted read-only access to the full set of
     MIBs available on each router.  For security and performance
     reasons we are now restricting snmp lookups to the following MIB-
     II objects:

          System, interfaces, at, ipForwarding, ipDefaultTTL, ipInReceives,
          ipInHdrErrors, ipInAddrErrors, ipForwDatagrams,
          ipInUnknownProtos, ipInDiscards, ipInDelivers, ipOutRequests,
          ipOutDiscards, ipOutNoRoutes, ipReasmTimeout, ipReasmReqds,
          ipReasmOKs, ipReasmFails, ipFragOKs, ipFragFails,
          ipFragCreates, ipAddrTable, ipNetToMediaTable,
          ipRoutingDiscards, icmp, tcp, udp, egp, transmission, snmp,
          enterprises.25

     As far as we have been able to tell, this restriction should not
     affect any SNMP polling currently being done on the network.

     T3 Network Performance for Source Route Optioned Packets
     ========================================================

     Some tests involving switching of loose source record route (LSRR)
     optioned packets were performed on the T3 network to verify network
     performance in the presence of Mbone traffic (thanks to PSC).
     Multiple streams of 7.8Mb/s each were sustained between PSC and
     Chicago for a bi-directional total of 23.5Mb/s of LSRR packet load
     without any packet drops or other problems.

     Scaleability

     Work continued on enhancements to the flow-level network simulator.
     Some code redesign was done to make the software more modular and
     to better support planned features.  The delay model has been
     completed.  Work is currently in progress on statistics collection
     and display.  A general statistics output file format is being
     defined to minimize the size of collected data files, which may be
     quite large for long-running simulations.

     Also, a candidate set of algorithm investigations has been
     proposed, and recommendations determined for the next phase of
     algorithm research.

     InterDomain Policy Routing (IDPR)

     We have been making the final tests of the IDPR gated software in
     preparation for the Internet pilot demonstration.  The machines
     that will act as policy gateways for the transit domains NSFnet,
     NSInet, and TWBnet will be shipped out in early April.  At the
     conclusion of the pilot, we will generate an informational RFC
     describing the results.

     We are also in the process of updating the configuration document
     for IDPR and expect to have a new draft by the end of May.

     Real-time Multicast Communications and Applications

     We began investigating hooking up ISI's MMCC conferencing
     application as a source and destination that can be accessed via
     BBN's videoserver.  We are currently awaiting a new version of this
     application which will provide a better interface for this work.

     We began work on extending the XIO protocol to support multicast
     video and multi-resolution video.  The XIO protocol is the protocol
     used by a software switch at the video server to communicate with a
     workstation running a video application.  Just as an analog
     hardware switch sets up analog communications between a source and
     destination, the software switch, using the XIO protocol sets up
     digital communications between a source and a destination.  The
     video server will support transmission of video to a multicast
     address, allowing multiple workstations to simultaneously view the
     same video.  The video server will also support transmission of
     multi-resolution video, enabling workstations to receive video at a
     bandwidth supported by the network connections between the
     workstation and the server.  With this capability, two
     workstations, one on the end of a high bandwidth line and the other
     at the end of a low bandwidth line, will be able to simultaneously
     receive the same video at two different resolutions.

     Paul Milazzo participated in a panel session entitled "Multimedia
     Internetworks" at InterOp '93 in Washington.  He gave a talk
     entitled "Video over IP Internetworks."  Paul also attended the
     IETF meetings in Columbus late in the month and participated in the
     Audio/Video Transport (AVT) working group meetings.  We are using
     an earlier version of the AVT protocol in the video server; we are
     keeping abreast of developments on the protocol and updating our
     implementation as needed.

     On the protocol and communications front, our work this month was
     concentrated on extending the design of the four service concepts
     (anycasting, multi-level flows, shared streams, and resource
     coordination objects).  A number of areas were found where the
     services could be made more general.  Considerable effort was spent
     to identify ways of making this work more widely available, and
     improving integration with other internet research.

     ANYCASTING -- The anycasting service has been implemented and is
     operational.  It is compatible with existing routers and routing
     protocols, though efficient address-space utilization requires
     routers to support mask-based routing protocols such as OSPF.  The
     current implementation works on SunOS and uses a simple extension
     of the BSD networking code.  The implementation is easily portable
     to other BSD-based systems, and the technique should be
     straightforward to implement on other platforms.

     MULTI-LEVEL FLOWS -- We are planning to augment the IP multicast
     routing implementation, mrouted, to support multi-level flows.
     This will include upward-compatible extensions to IGMP to identify
     which sub-flows the receiver desires.  A design goal is to support
     interoperation with unmodified IP multicast routers, though optimal

Internet Monthly Report                                       March 1993


     delivery of sub-flows may not occur when unmodified routers are
     involved.

     SHARED STREAMS -- This service is an extension of resource
     reservation mechanisms such as Fair Share and RSVP.  It permits
     multiple flows to request to share a single resource reservation,
     which allows distributed applications to make use of statistical
     multiplexing.  We are starting an implementation of shared streams
     based on the Fair Share code, and are planning to use resource
     coordination objects (see below) to describe the flows.

     RESOURCE COORDINATION OBJECTS -- RCOs are a general technique for
     distributed applications to communicate information about
     aggregates of network-related resources among hosts and network
     nodes.  They can be used to support both session-layer services and
     network-layer services, and can be used to coordinate auxiliary
     information about flows with network routing.  There are a wide
     variety of potential uses for RCOs, including distributed session
     management, network resource reservation, multicast access control,
     and intelligent resource preemption.  We have just started work on
     designing a basic infrastructure for RCOs, including a variety of
     propagation paradigms.

     MULTIMEDIA CONFERENCING

     At the Columbus IETF meeting, we chaired two teleconferencing-
     related groups.  The Audio/Video Transport Working Group is nearing
     completion in the specification of an experimental real-time
     transport protocol.  A second group on Conferencing Control met as
     a BOF to discuss the requirements of a session protocol for
     multiway collaborations, and particularly to focus on a suitable
     scope for this problem to establish a charter and a working group.
     The intent is to specify a protocol to support loose- and tight-
     control conference styles.

     As an example of how such a session protocol might interact with
     the already popular tools such as PARC's nv and LBL's vat, we
     demonstrated at the IETF an X-based version of the MMCC conference
     control tool.  MMCC takes a tightly-controlled approach to session
     management in that it explicitly shares full session-related
     information among all the participants.  In the demonstration, we
     used MMCC to invite a specific set of participants (vs having a
     wide-open session), to distribute multicast addresses and a shared
     encryption key among those participants, and to initiate as well as
     tear down sessions comprised of some selection of underlying tools.
     Since MMCC stays "in the loop" after session initiation, we expect
     it in the future to provide a channel for negotiation of quality of
     service and configuration parameters as they may change during the
     session.  We intend soon to release MMCC for more widespread use.

     The Columbus IETF marked the fourth live multicast of audio and
     video.  A memo on "How to do an IETF A/V multicast" was written to
     help the organizers of the Columbus and future IETFs to set up the
     necessary equipment.  Also, just before the meeting, Van Jacobson
     implemented IP encapsulation for multicast tunnels; with Steve
     Deering, we worked to test and distribute that code as widely as
     possible since it makes a big performance improvement.

     The paper, "The Impact of Scaling on a Multimedia Connection
     Architecture", was completed this month, and will appear in the
     Journal of Multimedia Systems.  A shorter version appeared in the
     3rd International Workshop on Networking and Operating System
     Support for Digital Audio and Video, San Diego, CA (Nov 1992).

JANET
-----

     March has been a relatively quiet month in terms of changes to
     JANET.  This has been due mainly to delays in receiving router
     equipment necessary to carry out the upgrades described in the last
     monthly report. It would seem that demand exceeds supply for cisco
     AGS+/4 components, and particular difficulty has been experienced
     in getting the HSSI interfaces necessary to implement the 34 Mbit/s
     backbone for SuperJANET. Delivery dates have been missed although
     revised dates suggest that it will be possible to bring this
     backbone up in mid April.

     On 23-25 March the JANET community had its annual Networkshop
     conference at the University of Birmingham. Traditionally this is a
     time when new ideas for the next year are discussed. One of the
     topics debated this year was whether there should be a migration of
     the JANET network from an X.25 base to an IP base. (Currently the
     network is based on X.25, with IP encapsulated on top of this.
     However, the strong growth in use of IP has meant that over 60% of
     the traffic on the network is in fact encapsulated IP.)
     Operationally it makes sense to move to less use of IP encapsulated
     over X.25 in the backbone, but the main question was whether some
     sites would prefer to use only IP in connecting to JANET, and
     forsake X.25. The consensus was that this should happen relatively
     quickly, to support the rapid growth in use of IP-based
     applications at sites, although there will still be a significant
     need to support X.25-based applications for some time at many
     sites.

     We are therefore now studying the best means of satisfying this
     demand -- at present the most feasible solution seems to be to
     migrate JANET to an IP network and to run a X.25 network on top of
     this by encapsulation. The X.25 network would be relatively large
     at the outset but, if the requirements expressed by site
     representatives at Networkshop turn out to be accurate, this should
     drop off fairly rapidly.

     The total IP traffic switched across JANET in March was
     approximately 1150 Gigabyte. Of this approximately 210 Gigabyte
     passed through the UK/US Fat-pipe, and approximately 115 Gigabyte
     to and from EBONE.  The number of hosts attached can be measured,
     to first order, by the size of the ac.uk domain. As of end March it
     contained 54338 distinct hosts in 296 subdomains. (This was an
     increase of 3510 hosts and represents approximately 90% of the uk
     domain.)

            Symposium

             About 80 people attended the seminar at the Princeton
             Marriott Forrestal Village to learn more about the
             Internet and its abundant holdings.  They remarked that
             the sessions increased their understanding and
             knowledge of the network and will allow them to make
             fuller use of what it offers.

     Announcement --  Transition from NNSC to the New InterNIC Team
     ==============================================================

     On April 1, 1993, the NSF Network Service Center (NNSC) began to
     phase out its services following the final award of the long-
     awaited "Network Information Services Manager(s) for NSFNET and the
     NREN".  The services formerly provided by the NNSC are being
     transferred to a new team made up of three separate organizations,
     collectively known as the InterNIC (the Internet Network
     Information Center).

       *  Network Solutions (NSI), has provided registration for the
          NSFNET since January 1992, and continues to perform all
          REGISTRATION SERVICES on host RS.InterNIC.NET.

       *  AT&T will provide expanded DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES
          on host DS.InterNIC.NET .

       *  General Atomics, which now operates CERFnet and the San
          Diego Supercomputer Center, provides a Reference Desk and
          general INFORMATION SERVICES on host IS.InterNIC.NET .

MERIT/NSFNET ENGINEERING
------------------------

     Significant activities for March included transition of production
     NSFNET configuration services to the new Informix-based Policy Routing
     Database; IETF activities (including NSFNET connectivity to the hotel
     via OARnet); and demonstration of "TUBA" applications over the OSI
     CLNP infrastructure in the Internet.  Projects involving the Merit IE
     group include development of and experimentation with Route Servers
     and enhancements to the PRDB to allow configuration of CIDR route
     aggregation for NSFNET. Status reports on the Inter-Domain Routing
     Protocol development project, and the Shared Whois Project, are also
     included here.

     Policy Routing Database Changes
     -------------------------------

     In March the Merit NSFNET-admin staff completed the cutover to the
     new, Informix-based, Policy Routing Database system. Design goals for
     the new system include flexibility to make changes for future routing
     database needs, though the initial deployment goal was to make the
     system look as similar as possible to the old system to allow smooth
     transition for the configuration operations staff.  The new system
     includes enhancements to allow batch updates to be more efficient, and
     streamlines the configuration file and report generation process.

     The new system is accessed using a generalized client-server
     interface, with clients ported to several unix systems (currently they
     are running on the Sun and IBM RS/6000 systems). The "show" clients
     for querying the database have been made available for anonymous ftp
     from merit.edu:pub/src/prdbshow.tar.Z.

     Projects underway for further development of the system include
     generation of configuration files for Gated (the routing daemon which
     will be deployed on the ANS routers), support of route aggregation for
     Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR), configuration support for
     planned changes to the ANSnet link to CERN in Switzerland, and support
     for configuration of route servers based on Gated.

     Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Activities

     During the IETF in Columbus, Ohio from March 29 - April 2, ANS
     provided connectivity to the Hyatt Regency Columbus workstation room
     to NSFNET. To support the TUBA demonstration of TCP/UDP transport over
     the OSI CLNP infrastructure, an RT workstation was deployed in
     Columbus to provide encapsulation for OSI connectivity.

Internet Monthly Report                                       March 1993


     During the BGP Deployment working group meeting, an Internet Draft on
     support of aggregation in the NSFNET was presented. Merit will support
     configuration of the backbone to support acceptance of aggregates from
     midlevel networks, announcement of such aggregates to midlevels, and
     aggregation on behalf of midlevels whose routers are not configured to
     support BGP-4. Merit will also implement an Aggregate Registry
     function which will allow registration by autonomous system peers of
     aggregations which will be announced between AS neighbors.

     Discussions of the TUBA approach to the "IP Next Generation" problem
     took place during the IETF Monday plenary session as well as in two
     working group sessions. TUBA implementations for six different
     platforms are underway. Discussion topics included dynamic host NSAP
     address assignment, mobile hosts, the routing and addressing plan, and
     TUBA transition strategies.  Implementation status as well as
     implementation and demonstration targets were discussed and agreed on
     as short term goals. An application document detailing changes needed
     to application protocols and implementations for TUBA will be
     written--this document will be useful for the other IPNG working
     groups as well.

     At the Network OSI Operations working group meeting, one of the topics
     discussed was formalization of CLNP operations. There was a call for
     24-hour monitoring of OSI routers and hosts. Another goal is policy
     routing database support for dynamic OSI routing protocols (intra- and
     inter-domain). Merit agreed to implement an OSI-ping process which
     will send e-mail for machines which do not respond via CLNP. We will
     also make the EON configuration file which maps NSAP prefixes to IP
     addresses for encapsulation available under merit.edu:pub/noop.

     The IDRP-for-IP working group also met at this IETF. Internet draft
     documents discussed at this meeting included an IDRP Family document,
     IDRP-for-IP, IDRP MIB and IDRP-OSPF interactions.

     IDRP Implementation Status
     --------------------------

     The IDRP implementation within Gated is underway and further progress
     was made this month. CLNP and IP routes were exchanged between routers
     using IDRP in Merit's test lab. A demonstration of the IDRP
     implementation is scheduled for April for the Mitre and FAA groups
     working on the Aeronautical Telecommunication Network. Deployment of
     IDRP on the ANS backbone is expected in July of this year.

     Shared Whois Project
     --------------------

     The project to share data on IP networks and related routing and
     contact information made progress this month. Merit and RIPE are now
     regularly sharing data using an agreed-upon "transfer syntax". The
     InterNIC staff at Network Solutions are working on this project as
     well.

     Another aspect of this project is the inclusion of NSFNET routing
     information in the X.500 Directory. Merit met with the InterNIC NS and
     AT&T staff and agreed on a schema to allow the InterNIC X.500 whois
     network entries to point to routing entries at Merit.  We expect to
     have this information online in May.

NSFNET/INFORMATION SERVICES
---------------------------

     The Merit Network Information Center (NIC) Services host computer,
     nic.merit.edu, contains a wide array of information about the
     Internet, NSFNET, and MichNet and is accessible via Anonymous FTP,
     electronic mail, Gopher, and WAIS.  The directory
     /introducing.the.internet was developed in cooperation with the
     Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) User Documents Working Group
     and is intended to provide recent information resources which will
     help the network novice become familiar with the Internet, its
     associated networks, resources and protocols.  New to this directory
     is John December's "Information Sources: the Internet and
     Computer-Mediated Communication," release 2.30, 15 March 1993.  Also
     of note in the directory /nsfnet/statistics are reports of NSFNET
     statistics, as they are available, at monthly intervals.  The primary
     tools used to collect the statistics are the SNMP and NNStat software
     packages.  Monthly reports are in sub-directories according to the
     year in which the data was collected.  Other files available in this
     directory are:

     history.bytes     Growth in traffic on the NSFNET as measured in
                       bytes.  Byte traffic measurements are available
                       as of March 1991, and represent the combined byte
                       traffic on the T1 and T3 infrastructures.
     history.netcount  Growth as reflected in the number of domestic and
                       foreign networks having announcement to the
                       NSFNET infrastructures.

     Another in the successful series of Merit Networking Seminars was
     held in San Francisco, March 15 and 16.  BARRNET hosted "Making
     Your Internet Connection Count: Technology, Tools and Resources,"
     and provided Internet connectivity to the demonstration room at the
     San Francisco Airport Hilton.  Apple Computer, Inc. donated
     Macintosh computers for use at the conference, enabling the 82

SDSC (SAN DIEGO SUPERCOMPUTER CENTER)
-------------------------------------

     SDSC Network Activities
     =======================

     The new CSUnet router has arrived and been installed at SDSC.

     We have registered new domains for the metacenter effort -
     metacenter.edu and metacenter.dni.us.  Additionally, our two
     network test probes for NCEnet research arrived and our being
     tested.

     We adjusted the MTU on our Cray from 32k to 16k.  This will serve
     as a work around to a bug in our Emulex terminal servers which can
     not handle larger values.

     SDSC hosted the first Torrey Mesa MAN planning meeting during
     March.  A second is planned for April.

     And, as it has been for the last several months, the building fiber
     install moves forward.

UCL
----

     UCL are now attached to the SuperJANET network at 140Mbps and video
     has been demonstrated at 2Mbps via Birmingham.

     UCL assisted Van Jacobson testing new IP encapsulated IP multicast
     tunnel code for the Mbone routers.

     The UCL CAR Conferencing system has been ported to Sun RPC and is
     being ported to Solaris.

     Peter Kirstein and Tony Ballardie attended the IETF in Columbus,
     Ohio.

UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE
----------------------


     1.   We have completed changes in both the DEC Ultrix 4.2a and Sun
          SunOS 4.1.1 Unix kernels to improve timekeeping quality with
          the Network Time Protocol. In the case of the DECstation
          5000/240, they reduce the jitter from almost 4 milliseconds to
          about 20 microseconds. In the case of the Sun 4/65, they
          reduce the jitter in half to about 40 microseconds. Since the
          phase-lock loop is now in the kernel, stability is improved as
          well to about one part-per-million. This allows the interval
          between network updates to be increased, as well as reduces
          the time to converge following reboot.

     2.   The current distribution of the Network Time Protocol Version
          3 has been augmented with several new timecode receiver
          drivers, including two for the Global Positioning Service
          (GPS) and one each for the German DCF77 system and U.S. Navy
          Omega system. With these drivers, redundant NTP primary
          (stratum 1) service is potentially available worldwide. Ports
          for several new Unix workstations, including DEC Alpha (OSF/1)
          and Sun SysV (Solaris), are near completion. Improved
          facilities to capture precision signals generated by some
          timecode receivers have resulted in accuracy improvements to
          the order of 40 microseconds with fast workstations and
          networks.

     3.   Through the kindness of the U.S. Coast Guard, we now have a
          cesium clock onsite, as well as a motley collection of GPS,
          WWV, WWVB, CHU and LORAN-C timing equipment. Efforts lasting
          over a year have not been able to identify the source of
          interference that disrupts WWVB reception in our area, so we
          have switched the master clock for our local nets and DARTnet
          to a GPS receiver. A second GPS receiver at Lawrence Berkeley
          Laboratories provides backup timing for DARTnet.

     4.   We are collaborating with Judah Levine at National Institutes
          of Science and Technology, Boulder, CO, in an experimental
          evaluation of the NIST Automatic Computer Time Service. The
          ACTS service is accessed via telephone modem with automatic
          correction for propagation delay. One of our hosts is set up
          to dial the ACTS service on a periodic basis, with performance
          measured using NTP and our master clock.

WISCNET
-------

       The DDS links connecting UW-Parkside and the Medical College
       of Wisconsin to UW-Milwaukee were replaced with SMDS service.
       We had considerable initial difficulties with the provider's
       switch shutting down the lines but these were cleared up by
       new software from the switch manufacturer.

       WiscNet now has two T1 points of connection to CICNet.  A new
       one from UW-Milwaukee to CICNet at Downer's Grove and another
       at UW-Madison.  WiscNet and CICNet worked jointly to route
       Milwaukee area through the UW-Milwaukee connection, other
       traffic flows through the UW-Madison connection.

       The WiscNet Board of Directors held a planning retreat 3/25/93
       through 3/26/93.

       A user conference will be held on 4/28 and 4/29 at UW-Stevens
       Point.  The conference concentrates on locating Internet
       resources with the theme 'where in the world is...?'  The
       keynote speaker is Connie Stout, Program Director, Texas
       Education Commission.  More information on request.
