                             IETF MONTHLY REPORT

     1. The next meeting of the IETF will be held in Amsterdam, The
        Netherlands, and is being co-hosted by SURFnet and RARE. The
        meeting will run from July 12-16, 1993. This is the first time
        an IETF meeting has been held outside of North America. Logistic
        and registration information has already been sent to the IETF
        Announcement list.

     2. The fall IETF meeting will be held in Houston, Texas from
        November 1-5, 1993. This meeting is being co-hosted by SESQUINET
        and Rice University. Please note that the Secretariat is NOT
        accepting registrations for this meeting at this time. Details
        will be provided to the IETF Announcement list following the
        July meeting. Note that information on future IETF meetings can
        be always be found in the file 0mtg-sites.txt which is located
        on the IETF shadow directories.

     3. It is with regret that I report that Bernhard Stockman has
        resigned as Co-Director of the Operational Requirements Area of
        the IESG, and that Brewster Kahle has resigned as Co-Director
        of the Applications Area of the IESG due to a lack of time
        available for IESG activities. John Klensin has been appointed
        as interim Co-director of the Applications Area.

        It is with deep regret that I announce the resignation of Greg
        Vaudreuil as IESG Secretary, a job he has held for the past four
        years. Greg will be leaving CNRI, but will still be very
        involved with the IETF. I would like to take the opportunity to
        introduce John Stewart who will replace Greg as the IESG
        Secretary (jstewart@cnri.reston.va.us).

     4. The IESG approved or recommended the following 15 actions during
        the month of June, 1993:

        o  IP Multicast over Token-Ring Local Area Networks as a
           Proposed Standard
        o  Definitions of Managed Objects for Bridges as a Draft
           Standard
        o  Generic Security Service API : C-bindings as a Proposed
           Standard
        o  OSI Internet Management: Management Information Base change
           of status to Historic
        o  Distributed Authentication Security Service as an
           Experimental Protocol

           as a Proposed Standard
        o  HARPOON: Rules for downgrading messages from X.400/88 to
           X.400/84 when MIME content-types are present in the messages
           as a Proposed Standard
        o  The Kerberos Network Authentication Service (V5) as a
           Proposed Standard

INTERNET PROJECTS
-----------------

ANSNET/NSFNET BACKBONE ENGINEERING
----------------------------------

     Network Status Summary
     ======================

     Two new releases of rcp_routed routing software was deployed on
     ANSnet in June.

     Planned topology changes to the T3 network where delayed from June
     until early July.

     The ANSnet ENSS206 (CERN) connection will be transitioned to a
     Ebone network service separate from ANSnet in early July.

     June Backbone Traffic and Routing Statistics
     ============================================

     The total inbound packet count for the network (measured using SNMP
     interface counters) was 31,728,509,254 on T3 ENSS interfaces, up
     5.8% from May.  The total packet count into the network including
     all ENSS serial interfaces was 35,532,881,785 up 4.9% from May.

     Rcp_routed Routing Software Changes
     ===================================

     During June two interim releases of the rcp_routed daemon, were
     deployed on select sites and we began deployment of a new version.
     The version called "Routerless AS Fix" was deployed on ENSS144
     (FIX-W) to facilitate Barrnet using OSPF/IBGP with a single AS (AS
     200).  ENSS144 still sees BARRnet as AS201 at FIX-W and AS200 at
     Palo Alto.  The "BGP Spooling Fix" version was deployed at selected
     sites to address a problem that occurred infrequently in the BGP
     output message spooling.  Towards the end of June, the "Dynamic
     Reconfig" version of rcp_routed began deployment (scheduled to be
     completed during the week of July 5).  The "Dynamic Reconfig"
     version contains a rewrite of the routing daemon initialization and
     reconfiguration code to minimize the impact of bi- weekly
     configuration changes.  This version also contains efficiency
     improvements and changes to improve routing session stability under
     heavy routing traffic exchange loads.  A bug was fixed where the
     wrong next hop was sent in a BGP update.  Release notes for
     rcp_routed software are available in:

         ftp.ans.net:/pub/info/t3-rcp_routed/Release-Notes

     Routing Stability Measured on the T3 Network
     ============================================

     Internal routing stability measurements are made by monitoring
     short term disconnect times (disconnects of five minutes duration
     or less).  This is intended as a measure of stability rather than
     complete connectivity.  June internal stability measurements
     decreased from May 1993.  Below is the monthly summary for each
     month including and excluding the biweekly configuration windows.

             MONTH                 overall   excluding configs
             ------                -------     -----------------
             January                 99.1%           99.5%
             February                99.0%           99.5%
             March                   97.5%           99.1%
             April                   96.1%           97.2%
             May                     97.4%           98.0%
             June                    95.5%           xx.x% **

       ** not yet available

     In May, the primary source of instability was intermittent CNSS-
     CNSS T3 circuit failures.  In June we observed a further increase
     in intermittent CNSS-CNSS T3 circuit problems.

     There were 2 incidents, each exceeding 5 hours in duration where
     CNSS-CNSS T3 circuits were intermittently lossy.  The circuits were
     CNSS16 <> CNSS64 on Jun 18 and CNSS32 <> CNSS56, CNSS56 <> CNSS72,
     and CNSS8 <> CNSS88 on Jun 30.  The latter was primarily due to a
     major fiber cutover to accomplish circuit diversity described in
     the June engineering report.  After the diversity circuit cutover,
     two CNSS-CNSS circuits connected to Washington DC were intermittent
     for over 5 hours.  A third major circuit problem occurred on Jun
     15.  Approximately 3 hours of intermittent connectivity was
     experienced on ENSS206 (CERN - Switzerland).  On June 23, over 1.5
     hours of instability resulted from an intermittent CNSS32 <> CNSS40
     circuit.

     In June there were several equipment power problems resulting
     mostly from customer premise power outages.  There were also ENSS
     rack power distribution or power supply problems, most notably at
     ENSS132 (PSC).  Throughout the month, ENSS230 suffered from loss of
     site power.

     A problem with the RS/6000 T960 T1 card was discovered that is
     induced by T1 circuit noise.  Circuit problems at ENSS168 (OARnet)
     and ENSS230 (Digital Express), induced failures of the ENSS T1
     cards and/or the T1 cards on the adjacent CNSS.  ENSS230 was most

     seriously affected and was rehomed from CNSS59 to CNSS57 to try to
     avoid this problem.  Several T960 T1 cards were replaced as well.
     New T1 card microcode will be deployed in July to correct this
     problem.  There were over 2 hours of instability on Jun 4, much of
     which appears to be related to problems with these T1 sites.

     The bi-weekly router configuration runs in June were more
     disruptive to routing stability than in previous months.  Due to
     the substantial increase in the number of routes, the
     reconfiguration software would occasionally lose routing sessions
     with external peers.  This will be corrected in the "Dynamic
     Reconfig" version, which is currently being deployed in June.

     In summary, ENSS236 saw over 8 hours of instability for the month
     (8:31:50 or 98.8% stability).  ENSS230 and ENSS206 each saw about 7
     hours (7:05:11 and 6:53:52 or 99.0% stability).  21 nodes saw
     between 2 to 5 hours of instability (99.3-99.7% stability).  35
     nodes saw between 1-2 hours of instability.  Here is how previous
     months compare:

        MONTH     >5 hr   >2 hr   > 1hr  >30 min   >15 min  <= 15min

        February     0       0       1      24        19        41

        April        2       2       3      13        12        57

        June         3      21      35      18        12         3

        Note:  in the May engineering report figures excluded the
               configuration windows.  The June data above is not
               comparable to the May figures since they include the
               configuration windows.

     The bi-weekly configuration runs in July should be less disruptive
     with the routing daemon changes currently being deployed.  The
     problems involving intermittent circuits that appeared in May and
     June will be fixed in new rcp_routed changes that detect and route
     around such problems should they appear.

     Planned T3 Backbone Topology Changes
     ====================================

     The backbone topology changes scheduled to begin in June '93, were
     delayed due to other maintenance.  The circuit changes have been
     re-scheduled and include:

Internet Monthly Report                                        June 1993


     1.     Add a T3 circuit between the Hartford CNSS48 and the
            Cleveland CNSS40.  This circuit was delivered to ANS in
            June and is scheduled for activation in early July.

     2.     Add a T3 circuit between the Cleveland CNSS40 and the St.
            Louis CNSS80.

     3.     Remove the T3 circuit between the Greensboro CNSS72 and
            the Hartford CNSS48.

     On-going studies are underway to segregate all T3 and T1 tail
     circuits and back-up T1s to the greatest extent possible in order
     to provide the maximum disaster protection through physical
     diversity.

     On-Going ANS Customer Activities
     ================================

     New Ebone Service
     -----------------

     In early July, ANS will transition the ANSnet gateway ENSS206
     (CERN) <-> CNSS35 (ANS N.Y.) to an Ebone Service.  This will
     involve rehoming the existing T1 link from Geneva<->NY, to
     Geneva<->D.C MAE-East.

     In conjunction with the rehoming of the U.S. end of the ANSnet AS
     690 T1 circuit from Geneva<->New York to Geneva<->Washington, the
     routers connecting this circuit will be configured to logically
     separate them from the ANSnet backbone.  In particular, the two
     routers involved will be reconfigured into a separate AS (1133).
     The European router (called cern-ebs2) will peer directly with the
     Ebone router at CERN rather than through a 3rd party proxy as is
     done now.  The U.S. router (called RS6K-US) will eventually peer
     directly with several neighbors across MAE-East, although this will
     be minimal as part of the initial configuration on Friday 7/2.

     The ANSnet core router in Washington will be the primary gateway
     for the Ebone service.  In case of a problem with this router
     RS6K-US will use ENSS136 located at College Park, via its MAE-East
     connection, as the secondary path to ANSnet/NSFNET.  However, in
     order to accommodate the requirements of the current routing
     software on the ANSnet backbone, RS6K-US will use a different AS
     number (AS 1674) in its peer session with ENSS136.  This implies
     that AS 1133 will be replaced by AS 1674 in case of problems with
     the primary ANSnet/NSFNET gateway to Europe.

     UNAM
     ----

     ANS is installing a connection to UNAM in Mexico City.  The Mexican
     half of the UNAM circuit has been delayed to June 30.  As a result,
     there is no action to be taken with this attachment until the
     circuit is delivered.  All other steps have been completed, and we
     are awaiting the circuit to begin testing.  If the circuit is
     delivered on June 30, activation will occur on July 2.

     OARnet Circuit Engineering
     --------------------------

     In order to take advantage of lower costs from Ohio Bell, two new
     T1 circuits are on order for OARnet.  These two new circuits will
     replace the existing OARnet T1 circuits that connect ENSS168<-
     >CNSS43.

     New Georgia Tech. T3 Circuit
     ----------------------------

     A new T3 lower cost local loop has been ordered for the Georgia
     Tech ANSnet attachment (ENSS138).  This circuit has been delayed
     several times in recent weeks; no current delivery date is
     available.

     Concert T1 Circuit Cutovers
     ---------------------------

     The two new T1 circuits provisioned out of an MCNC provided T3
     circuit will be used to replace the existing, dedicated T1 circuit

     Inter-Domain Policy Routing

     During the month of June we concluded the Internet pilot
     demonstration of IDPR, which included day-to-day monitoring of IDPR
     as well as a special demonstration for NSFNet people.  We are
     preparing an Internet Draft that describes the results of the pilot
     demonstration.

     We are proceeding with our implementation of policy-based multicast
     routing (i.e. IDPR multicast) and our integration of the fair share
     resource allocation mechanism with IDPR.

     Scaleability

     Initial design of the network editor component of the flow-based
     network simulator was completed this month.  Work is in progress
     implementing the editor using the InterViews/Unidraw X-windows
     toolkit, which specifically supports development of graphical
     editors.

     We have also started a study of the effects of network congestion
     and congestion management algorithms on real-time distributed
     simulation traffic.  This study is assessing the potential impact
     of packet scheduling policies and drop strategies on simulation
     fidelity.

     (See December '92 Internet Monthly Report for more details about
     this project and the toolset being developed.)

     Real-Time Multicast Communications and Applications

     The shared stream service (described in last month's report) has
     been implemented, and testing is underway on DARTnet.

     A paper describing Resource Coordination Objects (RCOs) is in
     progress, and should be available in July.  A brief overview of the
     RCO concept was given at the End-to-end Task Force meeting held at
     Xerox PARC at the beginning of the month.  RCOs are intended as a
     general mechanism for sharing network-related state between
     applications and network elements.  Possible applications include
     routing, reservations, session management, and group access
     control.

     (See January '93 and March '93 Internet Monthly Reports for more
     details about the application and communications services being
     developed.)

     MULTIMEDIA CONFERENCING

     The charter for the IETF WG on a Multiparty Multimedia Session
     Protocol (MMUSIC, previously the Conference Control BOF) has been
     revised and accepted so the WG is now established.  With the help
     of group members, a glossary, bibliography, conference style
     taxonomy, and strawman protocol functional spec have been prepared
     as input for the meeting to be held next month at IETF in
     Amsterdam.  The intent of the WG is to specify one or more
     protocols to support tight- and loose-control conference styles.

     The MMCC conference control tool implemented at ISI is an example
     of the tightly-controlled approach to session management, as
     opposed to the loosely-controlled approach of the LBL Session
     Directory tool.  MMCC allows an explicit list of participants to be
     called, and provides the equivalent of telephone ring and answer
     (also refuse) functions.  If a call is accepted, audio and video
     connections may be established using popular tools such as PARC's
     nv and LBL's vat.  A multicast address is distributed for
     multipoint calls, or normal unicast addressing may be used for 2-
     party calls.  An encryption key can also be distributed.  An alpha
     release of MMCC has been made within ISI and to some DARTnet sites;
     we intend to release it soon for more widespread use.

     In preparation for a fifth live multicast of audio and video from
     the Amsterdam IETF meeting, we have organized a re-engineering of
     the MBONE (multicast virtual backbone).  Problems and solutions
     were discussed in two teleconferences over the MBONE.  A new
     topology was designed for the North American portion of the MBONE
     to more closely follow the physical network topology and to reduce
     the fanout of the core multicast routers to avoid CPU overload.  At
     ISI, the Sun3/60 mrouter was upgraded to a SPARC 2 clone for more
     capacity.

     During June, some progress was made on new options for security in
     the Realtime Transport Protocol (RTP) draft, though we did not get
     it released as a draft and submitted as an RFC as planned.  Next
     month.  Since the nv program now supports color, our software
     decode routine for video from the Bolter codec has been augmented
     to decode color also.

JANET
-----

     The 34 Mbit/s pilot network continues to function well. Earlier
     problems with the use of OSPF as the IGP have now been sidestepped.
     (These concerned the propagation of subnets out from some sites and
     difficulties in redistributing them into other sites' IGPs. Fudging
     round this required static routes to be used as "glue", which was
     never operationally desirable, and a significant problem whenever
     there was a perturbation on the network due to hardware problems
     and/or configurational changes.)  Placing each of the routers
     involved in the backbone (6) in a separate area seems to be a good
     workaround.

     Service traffic is now flowing over this network between the sites
     involved.  After the connection of the international access point
     at ULCC to the main 34 Mbit/s ring, via a separate 34 Mbit/s spur,
     traffic from two London sites (UCL and Imperial College) to both
     the rest of JANET and to the Internet as a whole travels over this
     network. It is expected that the pilot network can be declared as
     at service status at the beginning of August. In preparation for
     this, the AGS+ routers loaned to us by Cisco UK for the pilot are
     now being purchased.

     It is not planned at this stage to extend the 34 Mbit/s network
     significantly.  One further experiment, however, is to attempt to
     connect a Wellfleet Backbone Link Node into the ring of Cisco AGS+
     routers at 34 Mbit/s.  This is proving problematical at present,
     due to the unavailability of PPP on the BLN, but an attempt is
     underway to use Frame Relay as a short-term alternative.

     The next major step on JANET will be the arrival of a large number
     of 10 Mbit/s SMDS connections -- of the order of 40. The first of
     these are due for the end of August, and acceptance testing of this
     technology is being planned. (JANET will be the first network in
     the UK to use this service.)

     Meanwhile, the usage of JANET as a whole remains roughly constant.
     There has been a continuation of the gradual migration from
     carrying IP over X.25 to devoting some bandwidth to IP use only. An
     "inner core" of the JANET IP backbone running IP directly over HDLC
     is now in place, and now acts as a conduit between other backbone
     routers that use RFC877 only and the international access point at
     ULCC. This has served to remove some of the load on the ULCC router
     from RFC877 traffic. A survey is currently being conducted of site
     requirements on access mode to JANET (via X.25, IP or whatever).

     On the International front, JANET has recently started to ship
     production traffic to SURFnet (Netherlands) and SWITCH
     (Switzerland) via EuropaNET rather than EBONE. This is part of the
     pre-production use of EuropaNET's IP service, and gives a 2 Mbit/s
     connection from JANET into the rest of Europe (EBONE currently
     gives 2 x 256 kbit/s, though an upgrade is planned). The MBONE feed
     of the IETF in Amsterdam into the UK will use EuropaNET to reach
     London (and thence into the UK-MBONE which is based on the 34
     Mbit/s pilot network). This will be the first time that such a
     broadcast has Mbit/s bandwidths available into and around the UK,
     so hopes are high of a successful demonstration of both video and
     audio.

MERIT/MICHNET
-------------

     Project Connect, a collaborative venture to assist Michigan K-12
     schools in becoming Internet nodes and participating in the
     international networking environment, held an Open House in Ann
     Arbor on June 4th.  Approximately 300 visitors attended the Merit-
     sponsored event to see demonstrations of Internet use in the
     classrooms of Page Middle School of Lamphere, Model High School of
     Birmingham, Mumford High School of Detroit, Northville High School
     and the Oakland Technical Center in Wixom.  Collaborative
     journalism projects, scientific data collection, electronic career
     exploration and a multimedia presentation, "K-12 Internet
     Applications," explored the diversity of the Internet through the
     unique perspective of each school.  Project Connect is sponsored by
     Merit Network, Novell, Merit/MichNet member universities, and the
     participating schools.

     Pioneering Partners for Educational Technology also showcased the
     projects of its winning teams.  Initiated in 1992 to spotlight and
     encourage the use of educational technology by the Council of Great
     Lakes Governors and supported by GTE North Inc., Pioneering
     Partners gives awards annually to schools in the Great Lakes States
     that are creatively using technology in their classrooms.  Among
     the winning teams from Michigan for 1993 were Page Middle School in
     Lamphere, Newberry Elementary School in Detroit, and Dickinson-Iron
     Intermediate School District in the Upper Peninsula.  An impressive
     sampling of computer graphic artwork was included in this display.

     The Open House provided an opportunity for communication vendors to
     learn more about the potential growth of K-12 institutions on the
     Internet, as well as the networking needs of the K-12 community.
     Also featured was a technical help center to aid school personnel

     by providing information on the technical aspects of connecting
     one's school to the Internet.

     Members of the Michigan Association of College Admission and
     Registration Officers were given an overview of Internet uses and
     resources as well as MichNet internetworking activities by Merit
     Associate Director Jeff Ogden and Sandra Waite of Merit's Network
     Information Center.  Representing 103 colleges, MACARO is
     interested in using networks to exchange student transcript, credit
     and grade information using electronic data interchange (EDI)
     standards.  EDI currently has its broadest application in the
     business world.

     The Greater Flint Educational Consortium has been actively working
     to encourage and coordinate business and educational partnerships
     in the Greater Flint Area.  In mid-June, the GFEC Board approved
     funding for the installation of a large pool of computer modems to
     facilitate a common dial-up access point for students and teachers
     to reach educational computer services in Flint, throughout
     Michigan and across the global Internet.  The project also includes
     the installation of a networked computer system, accessible through
     the modem pool, which will support a GFEC electronic bulletin-board
     style information server for the educational community in Genesee
     county.  Production use of Gopher software on a mid-sized SUN
     SparcStation is anticipated for October, 1993.  The information
     server will reside at the GMI Engineering Management Institute in
     Flint and maintained by GFEC staff.  The modem pool will be located
     at the University of Michigan-Flint, and managed by UM-flint staff.

     A 56K link now connects Jackson Community College to the MichNet
     backbone using a cisco router.  This upgrade is partially funded by
     a National Science Foundation Connections grant.  Upgrades
     scheduled for the near future in the Jackson area include increased
     speed for dial-in access and the installation of a Network Access
     Server.  Traverse City now has a total of ten 1200/2400/9600 bps
     dial-in lines.  Efforts by the Northwest Michigan Council of
     Governments and Merit's Hardware Support group aided in the
     installation of five new dial-in lines and the reconfiguration of
     the original five dial-in lines to match the standard for public
     dial-in (9600 bps, NMP4 without xon/xoff modem flow control).
     Providence Hospital and Oakland Community College are among the
     most recent organizations to become Merit/MichNet affiliates.

     The Merit/MichNet Washington, D.C. dial-in phone numbers will
     change in mid-July.  Improved response for DC dial-in users and a
     reduction in costs for Merit will result with the move of the DC
     dial-in node to a new location where it will share a 1.5Mbps (T1)
     link to the Internet.  A single hunt sequence will support

     1200/2400/9600 bps; 300 bps dial-in will no longer be supported.
     Additional modems are being installed to reduce busy signals
     experienced by users.  The new DC number will be 202/785-9001.  The
     cut-over date will be announced in a message printed when dialing
     into the current DC numbers.

     Merit/MichNet public dial-in access from Boston will be
     discontinued in September, 1993.  This access arose out of Medline
     service use by the University of Michigan, which is shifting to
     more direct access via the Internet.  SprintNet and Autonet access
     to MichNet from the Boston area will still be available.

     Effective August 1, 1993, MichNet will discontinue SLFP (Serial
     Line Framing Protocol) services and restrict SLIP (Serial Line
     Internet Protocol) services to basic service only on MichNet public
     ports.  MichNet is encouraging serial TCP/IP users to move from
     SLIP and SLFP to PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol).  PPP is a true
     Internet standard and a newer protocol offering better performance
     and enabling MichNet to provide authorization for access to some
     services.  MichNet authorization enhances network security and
     allows MichNet staff to assist in identifying and correcting
     network problems.  It also ensures that the NSFNET acceptable use
     policy is being followed.

     A version of NCSA Telnet that includes PPP support for DOS systems
     is available via Anonymous FTP from the host merit.edu in the file
     /pub/ppp/ncsappp.zip.  MacPPP is also available via Anonymous FTP
     from merit.edu in the file /pub/ppp/macppp1.0.sit.hqx.  A new
     dial-in service will be announced in the fall which will provide
     improved, faster PPP service.

     Merit Network will provide a Network Access Server (NAS) at each of
     the 25 sites where Merit/MichNet members and affiliates offer
     public dial-in access to MichNet.  The responsibility of providing
     dial-in access, including upgrades to increase the number of ports,
     would remain with the members and affiliates.  Replacement of all
     PDP-11 based SCPs/PCPs which support public dial-in access to
     MichNet is scheduled for completion in the fall of 1995.

     as /internet/documents/rfc/rfc1466.txt

     Merit has been awarded funding by the FAA in response to a request
     for the continuation of research being done under FAA Grant 92-G-
     0018.  The supplemental proposal, Implementation of Advanced
     Features of the Inter-Domain Routeing Protocol in GateD, defines
     the parameters for the continued development of non-proprietary
     routing protocol implementations in the ongoing cooperative effort
     between the FAA, Merit and MITRE.  Merit will implement the
     advanced features of IDRP according to the full International
     Standard version of the ISO 10747 specification.  The Merit
     software will provide a publicly available inter-domain routing
     protocol that will assist in the FAA's initiative to support
     inter-domain routing in the ATN environment.

     Ellen Hoffman is now Merit's Development Director, moving from her
     previous position as Manager of Network Information Services at
     Merit.  Jeff Ogden, Associate Director for Merit/MichNet
     activities, and Jim Williams, Associate Director for Merit's
     National Networking activities have assumed responsibility for
     Information Services management.

     Steve Burdick, Laura Kelleher and Dana Sitzler of Merit's Network
     Information Center Services staff gave a two-day workshop to
     educators at the University of Hawaii, Honolulu.  After an overview
     of the NSFNET and an introduction to Internet tools and resources,
     the emphasis turned to hands-on use.  Anonymous FTP, telnet,
     Gopher, and WAIS were among the tools attendees learned to use to
     discover and access Internet resources.  The workshop was sponsored
     by the University of Hawaii and the Hawaii State Department of
     Education.

     Kelleher also traveled to New Orleans, LA, to speak at a Coalition
     for Networked Information sponsored American Library Association
     preconference.  An update on NSFNET activities and "Cruise of the
     Internet" with special emphasis on library resources were the
     topics of Kelleher's presentation.  Chris Weider, of Merit's
     Information Delivery group, attended a meeting of the Special
     Interest Group on Information Retrieval, and a subconference on
     Information Access and the Networks.  Weider spoke on the
     "Integrated Information Architecture," which he and Peter Deutsch
     are collaborating on.

     Overview of NEARnet Mini-Seminar #2
     -----------------------------------

     On June 18, NEARnet held its second mini-seminar for 1993:
     "Searching for Network Treasures: A Librarian's Perspective and
     Guide to Internet Training," at Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc. (BBN)
     in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

     NEARnet liaisons and librarians were encouraged to attend, and over
     110 people particpated.  Videotapes of the seminar are available

     developed for the Special Libraries Association (SLA) by Marian
     Bremer, manager of the BBN library, and Hope N. Tillman, director
     of libraries at Babson College.

     Marian and Hope also included a sampling from their SLA Internet
     training course and highlighted specific Internet resources.  They
     discussed the lessons learned from training network users at the
     SLA, Simmons College, Harvard Business School, and Babson College.
     Hope described how she uses the Internet Treasure Hunt as a
     training tool.

     John Curran wrapped up the seminar with an update on Internet
     Engineering Task Force (IETF) User Services Working Group (US-WG)
     activities.  Corinne Carroll of the NEARnet User Services Staff
     presented an overview of the InterNIC (the NSF Network Information
     Services Management Team).

NORTHWESTNET
-----------

     The State of Oregon Department of Education joined NorthWestNet as
     an aggregate member in June.  This membership will provide
     connectivity to all public K-12 schools in Oregon to NorthWestNet
     and the Internet.

     The month of June also saw a significant increase in interest for
     NorthWestNet connections from health care organizations.  This is
     due in part to our joint National Library of Medicine (NLM) and NSF
     connections program, and collaboration on an additional three
     health-care oriented grants which are now in process.  NorthWestNet
     anticipates several new memberships from health care organizations
     in the near future.

     The Pacific Northwest Economic Region (PNWER) held a conference on
     June 28 in Seattle, WA.  Legislative leaders from Washington,
     Oregon, Alaska, Idaho, Montana, and the Canadian provinces of
     British Columbia and Alberta met to consider issues critical to the
     economic future of the Pacific Northwest including
     telecommunications infrastructure.  Dr.  Eric Hood, executive
     director of NorthWestNet, gave the plenary presentation titled
     "Information Infrastructure for the Pacific Northwest."
