INTERNET MONTHLY REPORTS
------------------------

The purpose of these reports is to communicate to the Internet Research
Group the accomplishments, milestones reached, or problems discovered by
the participating organizations.

Each organization is expected to submit a 1/2 page report on the first
business day of the month describing the previous month's activities.
These reports should be submitted via network mail to "IMR-ED@ISI.EDU".

ISI.EDU.  The announcements of new issues on the Internet Monthly Report
are sent to the IETF-Announce list and to this IMR list.

Requests to be ADDED or DELETED from the Internet Monthly report list
should be sent to "majordomo@isi.edu" with the message body either
"subscribe imr" or "unsubscribe imr".

Details on obtaining the current IMR, or back issues, via FTP or EMAIL
may be obtained by sending an EMAIL message to "rfc-info@ISI.EDU" with
the message body "help: ways_to_get_imrs".  For example:

     The Netfind Seed Database topped 2 million entries for the first
     time in September.

     Netfind version 5.1 went into production use in September.  It
     includes updates to the lookup and the search code.  The new
     support for Boolean queries allows the user to give more detailed
     specifications of a search than the previous version.  The latest
     version of Webfinder (version 2.0) is also in production and
     supports the new search features.

     Netfind is available at:

          http://ds.internic.net/wp/netfind.html

     The URL for Webfinder is:

     THE US DOMAIN REGISTRY


     THE US DOMAIN
     =============

     The US Domain registration form is now available online at
     http://www.isi.edu/us-domain.

     The US Domain has the maps of all the delegated special domains
     online at http://www.isi.edu/us-domain.

     Some of the processing of the requests to the third level domain
     name is now automated. In particular, most requests to register
     names in localities already delegated are automatically forwarded
     to the administrator of that locality.

     Recent announcements:

     1. A new policy has been added to avoid several cases of
     misleading, erroneous, and outright false information provided on
     registration applications.

     One situation that occurs is that one individual represents himself
     as several distinct companies in order to bypass some limitations
     on the number of delegations allowed (e.g., the 50/500 rule).

     Another situation is that with the requirement to provide a
     government employee as the administrative contact for a locality
     delegation.  Some applications have been received with a government
     employee's contact information but that person has no idea that
     such an application has been submitted.  Some applications provide
     contact information for an individual that knows what is going on
     but is not an employee of the locality government.  Still other
     applications have been received where the administrative contact
     information is fictional.

     The US Domain Administration may choose to verify any or all of the
     information on registration applications (including the
     administrative contact) and if it is determined that the an

     application contains false of substantially misleading information
     that application may be denied, or if already acted on the
     delegation may be revoked, and in either case all other delegations
     made to the party submitting the false or misleading application
     may also be revoked.

     2. A total of about 2000 locality domains that were delegated to
     several domain name managers have been returned to the US Domain
     administrator.  These localities will be made available for
     redelegation in the coming months.

     3. For delegations made after 1-Jul-97, it is assumed by the US
     Domain Administrator that every applicant for the delegation (or
     redelegation) of a locality name has the written agreement of the
     legitimate government for that locality for the applicant to manage
     the domain name of that locality.

     Evidience of such an agreement does not need to be presented at the
     time of delegation (except that the administrative contact on the
     application template must be the government representative).
     However, if the delegation is later challenged or contested, the
     manager of the locality domain must produce the agreement.  Failure
     to do so will most likely result in the transfer of the management
     of the locality domain to another manager that does have such an
     agreement.

     If there is a dispute as to what is the legitimate government for a
     locality is and who may act for it, the league of cities or
     association of municipalities that each state (as recognized by the
     National League of Cities) may be asked to assist in resolving such
     disputes.

     In some places there are overlapping jurisdictions with the same
     name (for example, the city of Los Angeles and the county of Los
     Angeles).  In such cases, the higher level government should have
     priority.  A new policy has been added regarding the charges for
     the domain name passed on during delegation.  The administrator of
     the locality has to notify one year in advance before charging for
     those domains.

     4. The US Domain administrator no longer makes direct registrations
     of hosts, and only makes delegations of third or fourth level
     domain names (such as localities).

MERIT INTERNET ENGINEERING
--------------------------

     This report summarizes September 1997 activities of
     Merit's Internet Engineering group on behalf of the Routing Arbiter
     (RA) service and other projects.






Ramos                                                          [Page 19]

     New tools and statistical reports on the Merit Web pages provide a
     variety of useful information about the current status of the Internet
     Routing Registry (IRR).  A new Java applet known as RODAN, the Route
     Object Duplicate and aggregation ANalyzer, makes it possible to
     display:

       -  All IRR routes originating from an AS.

       -  Duplicate objects, i.e., routes registered with the same
          origin AS in more than one registry, or registered more than
          once in a single registry.

       -  Routes that could be aggregated  to less specific prefixes.

     The reports also include monthly counts of:

       -  Updates of IRR Route objects, AS objects, and Maintainer
          objects.

       -  Routes registered in more than one IRR database.

       -  All queries to RAWhoisd, the RADB whois server, and whois
          queries to RAWhoisd.

       -  IRR Route objects with multiple AS origins.  In many cases,
          network operators choose to multihome their routes to ensure a
          redundant connection to the Internet. Other such routes are
          duplicates that have been mistakenly left in the registry.

     The new Web pages are available from:

     Jake Khuon attended the 28th RIPE meeting in Amsterdam. At the Routing
     Working Group, he gave a presentation on the Policy Analysis of
     Internet Routing (PAIR) project, which makes it possible to compare
     prescribed policy, i.e., policy registered in the Internet Routing
     Registry, with policy actually being configured in the Internet.  (See
     (http://www.rsng.net/pair/). At the Database Working Group, Khuon gave
     a talk on privacy extensions to RIPE-181 in the Routing Arbiter
     Database.

     Craig Labovitz presented a paper titled "Internet Routing Instability"
     at the ACM SIGCOMM '97 conference.  Co-authored with student Robert
     Malan and Professor Farnam Jahanian of the University of Michigan
     Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, the paper
     won the SIGCOMM '97 Best Conference Paper award.  The monograph
     examines the backbone inter-domain routing information exchanged

     between network service providers at the major U.S. public Internet
     exchange points. The authors describe several unexpected trends in
     routing instability, and examine a number of anomalies and pathologies
     observed in the exchange of inter-domain routing information.  The
     researchers show that the volume of these routing updates is several
     orders of magnitude more than expected, and the majority of this
     routing information is shown to be pathological. Furthermore, the
     analysis reveals several unexpected trends and ill-behaved systematic
     properties in Internet routing.  Several explanations for these
     anomalies are posited and evaluated with regard to their potential
     impact on the Internet infrastructure.  The paper is available from:

Internet Monthly Report                                   September 1997


The Requests for Comments (RFCs) are a series of notes, started in
1969, about the Internet (originally the ARPANET). The notes discuss
many aspects of computing and computer communication focusing in
networking protocols, procedures, programs, and concepts, but also
including meeting notes, opinion, and sometimes humor. The
specification documents of the Internet protocol suite, as defined by
the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and its steering group (the
IESG), are published as RFCs.

RFCs-to-be are edited by the RFC Editor.  RFCs enter the RFC Editor's
work queue either by an action of the IESG or by independent
submission.  Most independent submissions are referred to the IESG to
check for overlap with IETF work.  The IESG might put a hold on a
document to gather more input from its members.  The wait for an RFC
to be published varies as there can be unforeseen complications
(typically editorial matters that need clarification from the author).
Documents can be removed from the publication queue if they are found
to be insufficient or incorrect or if the IESG asks the author to join
work already in progress in the IETF.
