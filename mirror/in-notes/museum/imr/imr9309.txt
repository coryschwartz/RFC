INTERNET MONTHLY REPORTS
------------------------

The purpose of these reports is to communicate to the Internet Research
Group the accomplishments, milestones reached, or problems discovered by
the participating organizations.

     The Internet Monthly Report (IMR) will be reprinted (in whole) and
     published in "NICLink" by InterNIC Information Services.

     The IMR is for Internet information purposes only, and is not to be
     quoted (in part) in other publications without permission from the
     submitter.

Each organization is expected to submit a 1/2 page report on the first
business day of the month describing the previous month's activities.

These reports should be submitted via network mail to: Ann Westine
Cooper (Cooper@ISI.EDU)

NSF Regional reports - To obtain the procedure describing how to submit
information for the Internet Monthly Report, send an email message to
mailserv@is.internic.net and put "send imr-procedure" in the body of the
message (add only that one line; do not put a signature).

Requests to be added or deleted from the Internet Monthly report list
should be sent to "imr-request@isi.edu".

     Details on obtaining the current IMR, or back issues, via FTP or
     EMAIL may be obtained by sending an EMAIL message to "rfc-
     info@ISI.EDU" with the message body "help: ways_to_get_imrs".  For
     example:

     PRIVACY AND SECURITY
     --------------------

        The PSRG, in conjunction with the Internet Society, is
        sponsoring the Distributed System Security Symposium on February
        3-4, (1994) in San Diego.  The Symposium steering committee,
        which includes most of the PSRG plus additional members,
        completed review of submissions in mid-September and notified
        authors late this month.

        The PSRG members continue work on an Internet security
        architecture document and will be reviewing the current draft at
        the next meeting on October 5-7 at MIT.  A draft of the docuemnt
        is expected to be available before the end of 1993.

                          IETF MONTHLY REPORT

     1. The next meeting of the IETF will be held in Houston, Texas from
        November 1-5, 1993, and the registration reception will be held
        on Sunday, October 31. This meeting is being co-hosted by
        SESQUINET and Rice University. Following that, arrangements for
        the first meeting of the IETF in 1994 have been made. That
        meeting will be held in Seattle, Washington from March 29
        through April 1,1994. This meeting is being hosted by
        NorthWestNet.

        Note that information on future IETF meetings can be always be
        found in the file 0mtg-sites.txt which is located on the IETF
        shadow directories.

     2. The IESG has established a temporary ad hoc area to deal
        specifically with IPng issues. The charter for this new IESG
        area is to develop a recommendation on which, if any, of the
        current proposals should be adopted as the next IP. This
        recommendation will be submitted to the IESG and to the Internet
        community for review. Following an adequate period of review to
        surface any community concerns, the IESG will issue a final IPng
        recommendation. All of the current IPng-related working groups

Internet Monthly Report                                   September 1993


        will be moved immediately into this new area.

        This new area will be headed by two co-Area Directors from
        within the IESG: Allison Mankin current Transport Services AD,
        and Scott Bradner, current Operational Requirements AD.

     3. Responding to a number of requests, a new content requirement
        has been announced for all Internet-Drafts submissions.
        Internet-Drafts must now contain the full "ftp" filename in the
        text of the document. The filename information should, at a
        minimum, appear on the first page (possibly with the title).

        All formatting and content requirements for Internet-Drafts can
        be found in the file 1id-guidelines.txt which is located on the
        IETF shadow directories.

     4. The IESG approved or recommended the following nine Protocol
        Actions during the month of September, 1993:

        o  An Architecture for IP Address Allocation with CIDR as a
           Proposed Standard
        o  Applicability Statement for the Implementation of Classless
           Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) as a Proposed Standard
        o  Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR): an Address Assignment
           and Aggregation Strategy as a Proposed Standard
        o  Assignment of System Identifiers for TUBA/CLNP Hosts as an
           Informational Document
        o  Definitions of Managed Objects for IEEE 802.3 Medium
           Attachment Units (MAUs) as a Proposed Standard
        o  Definitions of Managed Objects for IEEE 802.3 Repeater
           Devices as a Draft Standard
        o  Host Resources MIB as a Proposed Standard
        o  Definitions of Managed Objects for Source Routing Bridges as
           a Proposed Standard
        o  Exchanging Routing Information Across Provider/Subscriber
           Boundaries in the CIDR Environment as an Informational
           Document

     5. The IESG issued two Last Calls to the IETF during the month of
        September, 1993:

        o  The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)
           <draft-ietf-pppext-lcp-main-02> (Draft Standard)

        o  PPP in HDLC Framing <draft-ietf-pppext-hdlc-framing> (Draft
           Standard)

     router forwarding table destinations to 25,000.  ANSnet internal
     stability improved in September over the August measurements.  New
     routing software was deployed in the ANSnet to reduce instability,
     and simplify the reconfiguration process.

     August Backbone Traffic and Routing Statistics
     ==============================================

     The total inbound packet count for the network (measured using SNMP
     interface counters) was 35,827,580,753 on T3 ENSS interfaces, up
     12.15% from August.  The total packet count into the network
     including all ENSS serial interfaces was 41,727,682,966 up 10.82%
     from August.

     Router Table Growth
     ===================

     The number of networks actually announced to ANSNET grew by about
     6.82% in September.  There were 16,558 configured networks by the
     end of September.  The maximum number of routes announced to the
     backbone was 11,621.

     A new system software version was released on the IBM routers in
     September that increases the capacity on each router interface to
     25,000 forwarding table entries.

     Rcp_routed Routing Software Changes
     ===================================

     The "Better IBGP Aggregation" version of rcp_routed ran on the
     ANSnet during the month of September.  Another rcp_routed release
     will be deployed in October.  This is expected to be the last
     rcp_routed release prior to the release of Gated.  This is the
     "Both IBGP and EBGP Aggregation" version.  Deployment will be in
     early October.  The "Better IBGP Aggregation" version of rcp_routed
     improved performance over previous versions.  The "Both IBGP and
     EBGP Aggregation" version further improves performance, and also
     allows the CNSS nodes to be interconnected using a FDDI ring rather

     than point-to-point interfaces within the carrier POPs.

     Routing Stability Measured on the T3 Network
     ============================================

     Internal routing stability measurements are made by monitoring
     short term disconnect times (disconnects of five minutes duration
     or less).  This is intended as a measure of stability rather than
     complete connectivity.  Internal routing stability during September
     continued the steady improvement that has been observed since June.

     The number of intermittent circuit problems was very low in
     September and the problems that did occur were quickly attended to.
     Problems on the C32-C40 link occurred a few times during the month.
     The E138 link has experienced had a low level of loss but has not
     caused routing instability.  The C8-C24 link and C40-C48 links went
     hard down on Sep 16 and Sep 30, but resulted in little routing
     instability since it was not intermittent.  The C32-C48 link went
     down on Sep 26 but caused little routing instability.


     Power and UPS problems at the Los Angeles area POP caused
     significant routing instability on Sep 5.  UPS problems occurred at
     the San Francisco area POP as well.  Numerous ENSS's experienced
     local site power problems, most notably ENSS230.  ENSS230 also
     suffered some problems with the tail circuit and routing software
     problems.  Router hardware problems were not a major contributor to
     instability although there were a number of problems.  A large
     disruption (3 hours) was due to the installation of an AIX 3.2
     build on Sep 17.  The network has been very stable since Sep 17.

     The number of nodes experiencing a great deal of accumulated outage
     time improved over June and July, though ENSS230 shows up in the
     >5hr column.  The breakdown by sites is as follows (these figures
     include instability seen during configuration runs):

     Although overall stability was improved, several nodes show up in
     the >2 hr and >1 hr columns.  This is because of the installation
     of the AIX build which took approximately 3 hours and credited each
     node with a significant amount of down time.  Only the 13 CNSS
     backbone nodes show under 15 minutes of instability for the month.
     Generally the T3 concentrators were in the >15 minute and >30
     minute range with the bulk of the histogram where the T1
     concentrators and ENSS fell.  This was due to the order of
     automated installation of the AIX build, proceeding from the
     outside in toward the core.

     Notable Outages in September '93
     ================================

     E173 (ITESM) suffered an extended outage on 09/07 due to flooding.

     E169 (InterAccess) suffered an extended outage on 09/09 due to
     hardware failure.

     E132 (Pittsburgh) lost T3 connectivity on 09/10 due to a fiber
     outage.

     E173 (ITESM) suffered an extended outage on 09/17 due to circuit
     problems.

     THE US DOMAIN
     -------------

     ISI administers the US Domain (under a contract from the InterNIC
     Registration Service (Network Solutions)).  In this issue of the IMR a
     summary of the status of the US Domain use is presented.  In future
     issues, only the monthly changes will be listed.

     In the Domain Name System (DNS) naming of computers there is a
     hierarchy of names.  The root of system is unnamed.  There are a set
     of what are called "top-level domain names (TLDs).  These are the
     generic TLDs (EDU, COM, GOV, NET, ORG, MIL, and INT), and the two
     letter country codes from ISO-3166.  It is extremely unlikely that any
     other TLDs will be created.

     Under each TLD may be created a hierarchy of names.  Generally, under
     the generic TLDs the structure is very flat.  That is, many
     organizations are registered directly under the TLD, and any further
     structure is up to the individual organizations.  In the country TLDs,
     there is a wide variation in the structure, in some countries the
     structure is very flat, in others there is substantial structural
     organization.  The organization for the US country domain is described
     in RFC 1480.

     Each of the generic TLDs was created for a general category of
     organizations.  The country code domains (for example, FR, NL, KR, US)
     are each organized by an administrator for that country.  Descriptions
     of the generic domains and the US country domain follow.

     COM - This domain is intended for commercial entities, that is
     companies.  This domain has grown very large and there is concern
     about the administrative load and system performance if the current

Internet Monthly Report                                   September 1993


     growth pattern is continued.  Consideration is being taken to
     subdivide the COM domain and only allow future commercial
     registrations in the subdomains.

     EDU - This domain was intended for all educational institutions.  Many
     Universities, colleges, schools, educational service organizations,
     and educational consortium have registered here.  More recently a
     decision has been taken to limit further registrations to 4 year
     colleges and universities.  Schools will be registered in the country
     domains (see US Domain, below).

     GOV - This domain was intended for any kind of government office or
     agency.  More recently a decision was taken to register only agencies
     of the US Federal government in this domain.  State and local agencies
     are registered in the country domains (see US Domain, below).

     INT - This domain is for organizations established by international
     treaties.

     MIL - This domain is used by the US military.

     NET - This domain is intended to hold only the computers of network
     providers, that is the NIC and NOC computers, the administrative
     computers, and the network node computers.  The customers of the
     network provider would have domain names of their own (generally not
     in the NET TLD).

     ORG - This domain is intended as the miscellaneous TLD for
     organizations that didn't fit anywhere else.

     US - The US domain provides for the registration of all kinds of
     entities in the United States on the basis of political geography,
     that is, a hierarchy of <entity-name>.<locality>.<state-code>.US.  For
     example, "IBM.Armonk.NY.US".  In addition, branches of the US domain
     are provided within each state for schools (K12), community colleges
     (CC), technical schools (TEC), state government agencies (STATE),
     councils of governments (COG),libraries (LIB), museums (MUS), and
     several other generic types of entities (see RFC 1480 for details).

     For a name in the US Domain please request an application via the
     RFC-INFO service.  Send a message to RFC-INFO@ISI.EDU with the
     contents "Help: us_domain_application".  For example:

                     To: RFC-INFO@ISI.EDU

     MULTIMEDIA CONFERENCING

     The user interface of mmcc, our session orchestration tool, was
     converted from direct implementation in XView to Tk/Tcl. The
     conversion allowed the user interface to be augmented in ways which
     would have been more cumbersome in XView, and decoupled mmcc from
     the user interface. This decoupling permits mmcc to interact with
     other Tcl-based tools directly, e.g., the nv video tool, and nevot
     audio tool. We are investigating the use of such interprocess
     communication between conferencing applications to permit
     negotiation of operating parameters and user preferences, as well
     as to coordinate the component user interfaces.

     Changes to the Realtime Transport Protocol (RTP) specification
     collected in the "next-to-last call" within the IETF Audio/Video
     Transport working group were incorporated into the document, and
     the "last call" for comments within the working group was issued
     during September.  Further comments on application-specific option
     number assignment and on port use were received.  A request has
     been submitted for the official "IETF Last Call" to be given as
     soon as these recent comments are incorporated.

MERIT/MICHNET
-------------

     Among the most recent of the growing number of MichNet affiliates
     are Novi Schools, Detroit Country Day, and the internetworking
     services provider, Rabbit Network.  Affiliate memberships for
     Adrian College, Aquinas College and University of Detroit-Mercy
     were possible with grant assistance from the National Science
     Foundation's Connections Program.

Internet Monthly Report                                   September 1993


     Oakland Community College, an affiliate member, upgraded its
     connectivity to the MichNet backbone with a Cisco Token Ring router
     and 56Kbps circuit at the Oakland University node.  Networks from
     OCC satellite campuses in the metro-Detroit area will soon be added
     to the OCC backbone link.  And putting the resources of MichNet and
     its member and affiliate institutions within a local call to even
     more Michigan citizens, the Library of Michigan has committed to
     providing four new public dial-in sites: Alpena, Petoskey, Gaylord
     and Wayne.

     A planned deployment of Network Access Servers throughout the
     MichNet backbone will provide state-of-the-art network access to
     users around Michigan.  Testing of the Livingston Portmaster at the
     University of Michigan MichNet site will conclude with the
     deployment of a 30-port production machine.  The dial-in service
     offered through the UM/MichNet NAS is configured for maximum
     flexibility regarding modem speeds, error correction and data
     compression, but will be used for PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol)
     access only.

     Currently, unrestricted access using MichNet public ports requires
     the use of PPP and authorization for a full service connection.
     MichNet encourages serial TCP/IP users to move to PPP, a true
     Internet standard offering better performance and authorization for
     access to some services.

SPRINTLINK
----------

     SprintLink and NSFNET International Connections Manager (ICM)
     September Status Report

     1)  Began assigning CIDR address space to new SprintLink customers

     2) Discovered Cisco bug that resulted in excessive CPU utilization.
     The fix reduced CPU load down to approximately 50% during the busy
     hour.

     3) Deployed FDDI wiring hub-embedded SGI Indigo workstations and
     terminal servers at both Washington, D.C. and Stockton, CA
     SprintLink/ICMnet nodes.  The workstations will provide DNS,
     multicasting, network time and capture router crash dump images.
     The terminal servers connect to the consoles of all the node
     devices for the purpose of remote control (via Sprint voice
     network) in the event of network (IP) failure.  Chicago and Fort
     Worth will be similarly upgraded in 1Q94.

     4) Deployed 350 SLIP/PPP dial-up ports.  Developed network-side
     auto configuration program.  Planning the deployment of another 650
     ports by end of 93.

     5) Placed orders for seven fully configured Cisco 7000 routers.
     These routers will be the new core of the SprintLink/ICM backbone.
     They will be initially connected by either T1 or T3 circuits.  In
     1Q94 they will be interconnected via Sprint's T3 ATM network.

     6) Placed orders for two HP 9000 G40 servers with mirrored disks, 8
     X terminals and HP OpenView.  Activation will take place the end of
     October.

     7) Activated Vadim Antonov's SNMPSTATD to produce daily CPU, memory
     and link utilization reports, daily link errors and times of router
     unreachability, and router temperature.  SNMP polling rate: every
     router every 30 seconds.

     8) Connected Moscow node to GALSnet, FREEnet and SOVam.  This node
     is in the process of expanding to include 16 new additional access
     lines.  Utilizing Russian-made "Techno PC," which provides
     multiline SLIP with BGP, to interconnect with Russian networks.

     9) Delivered T1 connection to Mexico CONACYT.  In process of
     turning-up routing.

     10) Delivered a 768 kbps connection to the Japanese Information
     Center for Science and Technology (JICST).  In process of turning-
     up routing.

     11) Deployed a router in the Sprint Stockton Technical Office
     Center (TOC) for the Japanese Internet Initiative (IIJ).  Plans are
     for peering with SprintLink and Alternet.

     12) Sprint deployed several "non connected" managed router networks
     utilizing CIDR addressing.

     13) The 64 kbps link to Uninet-ZA (South Africa) experienced
     serious congestion as a result of extremely heavy usage.
