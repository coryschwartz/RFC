     1. The IETF met for the third time this year in San Jose,
        California. This meetings was hosted by Sun Microsystems, with
        network connectivity being supplied by Barrnet. Though the
        numbers are still unofficial, this meeting was the largest by
        far with over 1,000 attendees.

        The IETF meetings for 1995 are starting to firm up. The IETF
        will be meeting in Danvers, Massachusetts (a suburb of Boston)
        from April 3-7, 1995. The summer IETF meeting will be held in
        Stockholm, Sweden the week of July 17-21, 1995. Due to the
        meeting costs, the IETF attendance fee for the Stockholm meeting
        will be US$300.

        The final meeting for 1995 will be held in Dallas, Texas. Once
        all the arrangements have been made, notifications will be sent
        to the IETF Announcement list. Remember that information on
        future IETF meetings can be always be found in the file 0mtg-
        sites.txt which is located on the IETF shadow directories. This
        information can also be viewed from the IETF Home Page on the
        Web. The URL is:

                     http://www.ietf.cnri.reston.va.us

     2. The minutes of the IESG teleconferences have been publicly
        available on the IETF Shadow directories since 1991. These files
        are placed in the /ftp/iesg directory.

        The following IESG minutes have been added:

           November 17, 1994 (iesg.94-11-17)


     3. The IESG approved or recommended the following two Protocol
        Actions during the month of December, 1994:

        o  IEEE 802.5 Station Source Routing MIB be published as a
           Proposed Standard.

        o  Definitions of Managed Objects for SNA Data Link Control:
           SDLC be published as a Proposed Standard.

     4. The IESG issued four Last Calls to the IETF during the month of
        December, 1994:

        o   Remote Network Monitoring Management Information Base
           <draft-ietf-rmonmib-rmonmib-03> for consideration as a Draft
           Standard.

        o  Printer MIB <draft-ietf-printmib-printer-mib-04> for
           consideration as a Proposed Standard.

        o  ATM Signaling Support for IP over ATM
           <draft-ietf-ipatm-sig-02> for consideration as a Proposed
           Standard.

        o  Routing Information Protocol <RFC1058> be reclassified as
           Historic.

     5. One Working Group was created during this period:
           New Generation Transition (ngtrans)

        and one was concluded:
           Interfaces MIB (ifmib)


     6. A total of 29 Internet-Draft actions were taken during the month
        of December, 1994:

     EUROPANET GROWTH IN 1994

     EuropaNET, DANTE's international network for the European research
     networks, grew fast in 1994. In total the traffic load on the network
     more than quadrupled. The total EuropaNET backbone access point
     capacity is currently 24 Mbps, with each access point connected to at
     least two trunk lines (the total trunk capacity of EuropaNET is
     30 Mbps). An overview of total traffic growth and traffic growth of
     the ten 'largest' access ports can be obtained from URLs:
     http://www.dante.net/traffic.GIF and http://www.dante.net/top-10.GIF.

     EUROCAIRN STUDY SUBMITTED

     In view of its current customer base and pan-European backbone
     management experience, DANTE is in an excellent position to be at
     the forefront of the development of the next generation research
     backbone in Europe. The Eureka EuroCAIRN project, set up to
     improve network facilities for European researchers, contracted
     DANTE in June 1994 to prepare a plan for the immediate procurement
     of a high speed network for research in Europe.

     The draft Final Report of the EuroCAIRN study was submitted to the
     EuroCAIRN Committee on December 24th 1994 and they will consider it
     at their next meeting on 20 January 1995. The study details the high
     speed networking requirements of the European research network
     organisations, presents a technical and commercial options
     analysis as well as a detailed plan for the immediate deployment
     of a 34 Mbps pan-European network for research.

     Earlier, on 8 November 1994, DANTE had organised a meeting in
     Brussels with representatives of the national research networks to
     receive their feedback on the preliminary findings of the study.
     During the meeting several attendees stressed again the urgency of
     setting up the new high speed infrastructure as soon as possible.

     TRANSATLANTIC CONNECTIVITY INCREASING

     The first circuits as part of the plans to upgrade EuropaNET
     connectivity from Europe to the US have been acquired. A new T1
     (1.5 Mbps) line between Amsterdam and New York became operational
     in December 1994. This brings the total capacity of EuropaNET's US
     connectivity to 5 Mbps. The order for the second T1 link from
     Amsterdam has been placed and the link is expected to be in place
     by February.

     At the request of SURFnet and DFN, DANTE will manage a direct link
     between Germany and the Netherlands. One use of this additional
     capacity will be for traffic between the Dutch and the German

     Aviation and Space Research institutes. For this purpose DANTE
     will set up a Point of Presence (PoP) in Aachen, Germany. In addition
     DFN has decided to obtain additional intercontinental connectivity
     from DANTE which can be delivered via Amsterdam and this new
     German-Dutch link. A further T1 circuit will be ordered to provide
     the extra capacity needed. To improve the US service for other
     EuropaNET subscribers ways of upgrading the capacity of the DANTE
     gateway in Amsterdam (which provides them with US access) are being
     discussed with Unisource.

     DANTE has started work under a contract with the European
     Commission to set up a connection between EuropaNET and Canada.
     The first phase of the work will be to assess what sort of
     capacity is needed and how it can best be organised. A
     recommendation will follow on which the actual implementation plan
     will be based.

     DANTE SECURITY SERVICE

     At the request of a number of national networks, DANTE will create a
     European level CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team) service. DANTE
     is currently working on a detailed service specification which will
     be published shortly. The objectives of the CERT service will be: the
     coordination of incident handling between member CERTs and with other
     incident response teams worldwide; the coordination of technical
     assistance to member CERTs; the maintenance of an information server
     on operational aspects of computer security; assistance for the
     establishment of new CERTs and the provision of backup and support to
     resolve problems that cannot be handled by a member CERT.

     The DANTE CERT service will build on the expertise and experience
     of the national CERTs that are already in place. The DANTE CERT will
     participate fully in existing international bodies dealing with
     incident response and security. Full membership of FIRST (Forum on
     Incident Response and Security Teams) will be applied for. As is
     DANTE's normal practice, many of the operational components of the
     DANTE CERT activity will be sub-contracted; discussions on how best
     to do this are already taking place with organisations which are
     interested in carrying out this task.

     CESSATION OF DISCUS

     DISCUS, the continuation of the CONCISE central European

     maintained information service such as DISCUS has, to a great
     extent, been overtaken by distributed services such as the WWW and
     Gopher. It has not proved possible to find a sufficiently large
     customer base to continue the service on a commercial basis.

     Therefore DISCUS will cease to exist in its current form by 31
     January 1995. By courtesy of FUNET (Finnish research network) the
     current information will remain accessible for at least six months at
     URL: ftp://ftp.funet.fi/index/DISCUS. DANTE is considering the
     possibility of continuing some elements of the service if required.

INTERNIC DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES

In December, we upgraded the X.500 server on ds0.internic.net to the
ISODE Consortium's version 2.1.  This version should appear the same to
users in terms of user interface and features supported, but it is
faster than the system we had been using, and should also be more
reliable.

We run two X.500 DSA's, one on ds0.internic.net and the other on
ds2.internic.net.  They back each other up; in case of failure or
maintenance on one, X.500 clients will automatically go to the other.
The server on ds2.internic.net will be upgraded to the new release in
January.

X.500 provides a "Directory Information Tree", or DIT, that supports
organizations all over the world.  Any server that is part of the tree
can help you get information from any part of the tree, so users of our
system can get listings from organizations in Europe, Austrailia, and
Japan (as well as North America).

To access the X.500 directory from our servers, log in as "x500" and
follow the instructions, or log in as "guest" and select option 3 and
then option 2.

While there are over 1 million entries in the global DIT, there are many
organizations that do not have X.500 directories.  One of our most
frequently asked questions is why someone who works for a well known
company or university cannot be found in X.500.  Most often, it is
becuase that organization does not have an X.500 directory that is part
of the DIT.

A reminder - if you would like to help the Internet community find a
resource that you offer, send mail to admin@ds.internic.net and we will
send information about listing your resource in the Directory of
Directories.

     NETSTATION
     ==========

     Those of us working on the Netstation project at USC/ISI have been
     wrestling with the issues that arise when interfacing devices via a
     gigabit network rather than a system bus.  Rearchitecting a
     workstation around a network raises many interesting research
     issues and an abundance of implementation choices.  These monthly
     reports are intended to keep the research community informed of
     current project directions and implementation/design choices.

     Recent efforts have focused on clarifying and documenting the
     fundamental architectural choices, e.g. the concepts of network
     devices, service and device interfaces, and the required naming and
     binding schemes.

     Network Devices and Service Interfaces

     We call a "device" that is controlled via network protocols a
     network virtual device (NVD) to emphasize that the interface that



Cooper                                                         [Page 15]

Internet Monthly Report                                    December 1994


     is exported by the NVD may be a synthetic one.  The process that
     controls an NVD, its Owner, uses the exported interface to control
     it.

     The exported interface is generically a "service interface", which
     may provide access to an actual physical device or to a higher-
     level abstraction; the more specific term "device interface" is
     used to refer to lower-level "raw" abstractions.  However, details
     specific to the control of a particular hardware device inside an
     NVD can be hidden when that does not interfere with the functional
     use of the NVD.  Many of these, such as register addresses, control
     bit assignments, and timing restrictions can often be completely
     managed internally by the NVD.

     At one extreme an NVD may be entirely virtual, consisting of a
     disembodied process that is not physically associated with any
     peripheral devices.  For example, a large wall-size display device
     may export a "raw" full-screen interface.  This interface, in turn,
     may be "owned" by some process (on another machine) which will
     subdivide the display surface to provide several workstation-size
     display devices.  Such an NVD may be thought of as exporting a
     network service rather than a device interface, but since the
     access mechanisms for NVDs in all cases are based upon network
     protocols, that distinction is a fine one.

     Tentatively, the line that is drawn between a Netstation device and
     a network server process is the means of communication.
     Interactions with Netstation devices are via a reliable RPC
     mechanism that mimics the reliability and functionality of intra-
     workstation bus-based communication.  Hence, an X-Window server
     would not itself be an NVD (as connections are made via TCP), but
     the X-window server process may control an NVD display (e.g. the
     virtual workstation-size portion of the wall-size display described
     above).

     This use of a lightweight RPC transaction protocol for device
     access implies that direct device control will be practically
     limited to a local area network.  For applications such as cross-
     country video, the transport functionality required over long delay
     paths will better served using an application process (local to the
     display device) to receive TCP (or RTP) streams and generate device
     control messages.

     Amidst this generality, it is easy to loose sight of the original
     mission of an NVD, which is a device that is controlled via
     commands sent across a network instead of a system bus.  A simple
     NVD will function much like its bus-interfaced counterpart.  A
     process should be able to open an NVD and become its exclusive



Cooper                                                         [Page 16]

Internet Monthly Report                                    December 1994


     controlling Owner.  In particular, a kernel process should be able
     at boot time to open its NVDs and gain exclusive controlling access
     to them.

     Device/Service Access and Naming

     A simple NVD will export a single device interface to be used by
     some single Owner process on another host.  This could be a
     primitive interface that closely models the functions of the
     underlying physical device.  The network would carry the Owner's
     device commands and the responses from the NVD that they generate
     via our reliable RPC protocol.

     However, access to NVDs may be complicated by the fact that a
     single local area network interface may provide network access for
     multiple NVDs.  Several physical resources may be available within
     a particular Netstation chassis, and various capabilities and
     virtual capabilities may be exported simultaneously with individual
     interfaces and/or a combined interface.

     For example, a Display NVD chassis might contain several distinct
     devices: frame buffer, audio output, and JPEG decompression units.
     Each of those can accept independent streams of input data and
     commands.  These could be individually exported as a single complex
     Display NVD interface or each as a distinct NVD interface.  This
     could be dynamically determined under the NVD Owner's control or by
     the code loaded when the chassis is booted.

     We propose to use a method which allows similar access for any type
     of NVD.  This approach should be straight-forward in the common
     case of a simple NVD, and extensible as NVDs become more complex.
     All NVDs will export an RPC-based "access" interface that is
     presented via a well-known port.  RPC calls will be made available
     via that interface for OPENing, CLOSEing, and obtaining additional
     NVD-specific information and status.

     The basic operation performed by any process wanting to access any
     device will be an RPCopen(device_name) call made to the well known
     port at Netstation chassis interface.  The Netstation device can
     demultiplex the initial request based on device name (if needed),
     and a separate communication channel can be allocated for a
     particular device session.  In the degenerate case of a single
     device on an interface, a default device name referring to "self"
     could be used.

     This approach provides a well-defined rendezvous point for device
     access, and allows devices to have varying degrees of
     sophistication.  For example, simple devices with insufficient



Cooper                                                         [Page 17]

Internet Monthly Report                                    December 1994


     resources to implement an access control database and other complex
     management functionality can be configured to forward RPCopen()
     calls to a surrogate managerial process.

     The basic information needed to open and gain control over an NVD
     is the NVD's Internet address and the appropriate device name to be
     used as a demultiplexor.  The NVD network address is similar in
     function to the device address that is needed at boot time to
     access and control a bus-interfaced device.  It is assumed that the
     underlying network- and link-layer protocols deal with packet
     delivery functions.

     Naming, Device Location, and NetStation Configuration

     An NVD's address can be determined directly or it could be
     determined from its "name".  We assume NVD names will correspond to
     the domain-name hierarchy.  The most basic NVD management functions
     will use the DNS to map device names to their access address.

     The device's domain-name can also be used directly to demultiplex
     within multi-device NVD interfaces, or the DNS can return an
     internal NVD number (along with internet address) to be used for
     this purpose.  Similarly, the DNS could return a port number
     specific to a particular NVD as an alternative to the well-known
     port rendezvous approach.  These additional mappings could be
     supported currently using DNS "TXT" resource records.  Recently
     proposed DNS extensions for dynamic update could support
     dynamically-instantiated virtual devices.

     The functionality provided by these DNS mappings serve as the
     lowest-level NVD management service.  Using domain names as an
     intermediate layer, additional services such as configuration (i.e.
     determination of associations among Netstation devices) and
     resource location (i.e.  determination of which devices are
     available to meet certain requirements) will be layered on top of
     these basic mapping services.  We expect to exploit current IETF
     work in Dynamic Host Configuration and Service Location to provide
     some of these Netstation management functionality.

     PC-ATOMIC
     ---------

     ATOMIC PERFORMANCE TESTS

     We have measured the performance of NFS and FTP over ATOMIC, and
     found (as expected) that the disk bandwidth is the bottleneck.
     Ethernet performance is network-limited to 7-8 Mbps, but the ATOMIC
     LAN provides disk-limited 18 Mbps FTP and 19 Mbps NFS.

     FTP performance is relatively independent of file size, but NFS
     exhibits a long "ramp" where 200K byte files are 8 Mbps, 700K byte
     files are 13 Mbps, and the bandwidth tops out for 2M byte files. We
     used 16K byte packets for these measurements.

     Prior measurements indicate that native packet memory-memory
     bandwidth over ATOMIC is 300 Mbps, TCP is 48 Mbps, and UDP is 54
     Mbps.

     NFS and FTP bandwidths in the ATOMIC LAN are limited by the
     read/write bandwidths of the SPARCs.  We found that (on a SPARC
     20/50 or 10/512) the disk write bandwidth was 20 Mbps, and the read
     bandwidth was 275 Mbps. (A Sparc 2 has a lower read bandwidth, near
     60 Mbps).

     We are also measuring the performance the ATOMIC LAN when two
     sources contend for a shared link. We used a configuration as shown
     below:

                    S1 -----> switch -----> R
                                ^
                                |
                                |
                                |
                                S2

     In our experiment, S1 emits 512-byte packets, and we vary the size
     of the packets from S2 (over multiples of 512). Myricom's switches
     apparently perform round-robin arbitration on a per-packet level,
     so the bandwidth per source at the multiplexing switch is a ratio
     of the packet sizes.

     We hope to use this information, along with interval gaps in packet
     emission, to provide a source-level mechanism that emulates the
     configurable router queuing disciplines. These disciplines are
     assumed by QoS and policy mechanisms, but do not exist in the
     ATOMIC LAN.

     ATOMIC LAN INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION

     We have developed automated procedures for configuring a machine to
     use only the ATOMIC interface for network communication from
     power-up for all SPARC 2, 10, and 20 machines running SunOS 4.1.3.
     This required adding the Myricom driver to the kernel. We are
     developing a plan for migrating all ISI HPCC Division Sun SPARCs to
     the ATOMIC LAN, while allowing machines to individually revert to
     the Ethernet backup after rebooting.

     ATOMIC GATEWAY PROGRESS

     We have a version of VINCE installed that is modified to use the
     FORE SBA-200 S-BUS host interface card to communicate with the NRL
     PTAI S-BUS host interface card. We are currently evaluating the two
     cards for use in an ATM gateway, first using a SPARC S-BUS, and
     later as a stand-alone system.

     Work is continuing on our evaluation of the x-Kernel (Peterson,
     Arizona) as a possible vehicle for protocol experiments that bypass
     the current BSD implementations of TCP/IP.  We are currently
     porting the ISI "blast" program, which measures TCP and UDP
     performance in memory-to-memory data transfers, to run as part of
     the x-Kernel.  Preliminary results indicate that other tuning will
     be required in order to achieve good performance results.  If this
     phase of the project is successful, we plan to use the x-Kernel to
     investigate experimental protocol implementations and direct
     coupling of the lowest level of the x-Kernel and the drivers for
     various high-speed networks including ATOMIC and ATM.

     HIGH PERFORMANCE SECURITY ISSUES

     This month we issued an Internet Draft of our report on MD5
     authentication (IMR Nov. 1994). It is available at the usual
     places, including: ftp://ftp.isi.edu/internet-drafts/draft-touch-

     MULTIMEDIA CONFERENCING

     We have added an automated user directory to MMCC, ISI's session
     tool that orchestrates explicit-invitation, multiway calls by
     exchanging address and configuration information and spawning
     familiar MBONE tools (e.g., vat, nv).  Originally, users could set
     up their own personal address books using a combination of a
     startup file, on-the-fly entry from the graphical user interface
     (GUI), and automatic updates as new users called.  However, users
     have requested an easier method to dynamically find the addresses
     of others who are willing/able to "accept" calls, i.e., others who
     are running MMCC.  To this end, we have augmented MMCC with a
     multicast user directory function.  On a fixed multicast address,



Cooper                                                         [Page 26]

Internet Monthly Report                                    December 1994


     MMCC will announce (if enabled) the user's availability at a
     particular locale.  Each MMCC also listens on that address for
     announcements from remote users and adds those users to its
     directory.  Thus, MMCC acts in part as a user locator service.

     This approach was inspired by the control component of the RTP
     protocol developed in the IETF Audio/Video Transport working group,
     and by LBL's session directory tool, sd.  The idea was to apply
     these multicast-based techniques to the user directory problem.
     Besides the known resiliency of a soft-state multicast approach, we
     use multicast announcements to obtain the appropriate TTL for
     reaching remote users and also to track mobility.  Notably, we make
     user directory announcements at different TTL levels so that
     announcements may be made more frequently within smaller regions
     (lower TTLs). Each remote MMCC also stores the minimum TTL (as
     inserted by the sender) at which the announcement was first heard.
     When a session is created, MMCC selects the maximum of the minimum
     TTL values of all group members and passes this value to the
     associated media tools for proper scoping of the multicast real-
     time data.

     Presently, we are working to solve some of the scaling issues
     before wider release of this feature.  For example, scaling effects
     everything from the network bandwidth consumed by announcement
     messages to the GUI's ability to organize and filter lists of
     users, and to the internal architecture of data structures for fast
     user lookup.  Therefore, we are currently experimenting with
     parameterizing the tool for efficient operation as the number of
     users grows very large.

MERIT/NSFNET ENGINEERING
------------------------

     This report summarizes recent activities of Merit's Internet
     Engineering and Network Management groups on behalf of the Routing
     Arbiter Project and the NSFNET Backbone Service Project.

     The CNMS (Centralized Network Management System), developed by
     Merit for the Routing Arbiter project, is now performing
     preliminary monitoring of the Route Servers at the PacBell NAP and
     the MFS MAE-East facility, and beginning to perform delay
     measurements to the Route Servers.  The combination of these
     figures with packet delay and loss measurements at the NAPs will
     help the RA team gauge reliability of the NAP fabric and in-band
     connectivity between the RA NOC and the NAPs.

     Work continues on replacement of the Policy Routing Database
     (PRDB), used for the NSFNET Backbone Service, with the Routing
     Arbiter Database (RADB).  The RADB itself forms part of the new
     Internet Routing Registry (IRR), which will incorporate registries
     maintained by several national and international networking
     organizations.  Under the RADB, the method for submitting new nets
     to be routed over AS690 will change.  Instead of submitting NACRs
     through e-mail, users will directly register information by sending
     in "route templates."   Additions and entries to the new registry
     will be made by the home AS that creates the route, rather than by
     an AS690 peer AS.  Merit is working closely with RIPE to ensure
     that the RIPE database will have all required routing information
     when the PRDB is retired and authoritative routing information for
     European routes is maintained by the RIPE NCC.  Transition plans
     are available on the RADB Web site (http://www.ra.net/rrinfo.html)
     and through anonymous FTP to ftp.ra.net in the /pub/radb/
     directory.  For more information about using the RADB, send e-mail
     to rrgroup@merit.edu.

     Peering sessions have been established between the ANS/NSFNET
     backbone and Network Service Providers at the three priority NAPs
     and MFS's MAE- East facility.  At the PacBell NAP, ANS/NSFNET is
     peering with MCInet, CRL, and the RA Project's Route Server; at the
     Sprint NAP, ANS/NSFNET is peering with SprintLink and MCInet; at
     the MFS facility, ANS/NSFNET is peering with AlterNet, CERN/DANTE,
     PIPEX, PSI, NETCOM, MCInet, and Net99.  Physical connections to the
     Ameritech NAP have been established by ANS/NSFNET, the RA Route
     Server, and MCInet.

     The number of regionals that have completed their transition from
     the NSFNET backbone service grew substantially this month.
     MOREnet, THEnet, NYSERNet, NevadaNet, and MSCnet are now obtaining
     interregional Internet service from SprintLink, and SURAnet is
     obtaining service from MCInet.  CA*net, the Canadian national
     network, has cut over from the NSFNET backbone service to MCInet.

     The current version of the ANS/NSFNET router software fixes two
     long- persistent backbone problems:  hangs in the FDDI cards used
     in the RS/6000 backbone routers, and spontaneous resets of the T3
     interface cards in the ANS Ciscos.

     Several staff led sessions at the 31st IETF, held December 5-9 in
     San Jose.  Jessica Yu (with Vince Fuller of BARRNET) led the
     session of the CIDR Deployment Working Group (cidrd).  Elise Gerich
     gave a presentation about the NSFNET transition at the Network
     Management Area open meeting, participated in the IAB open meeting,
     and co-chaired the IEPG meeting preceding IETF.  The IEPG meeting
     was also attended by other Merit staff and many Network Service

     Providers.  In addition, Merit staff members participated in the
     Second ATM NAP Workshop, which focused on issues related to the
     construction and operation of ATM NAPs.  The workshop also included
     presentations by several Network Service Providers.

     Jessica Yu gave a talk about the NSFNET transition and the Routing
     Arbiter Project at the CICNet technical board meeting.

SPRINT NAP PI
-------------

     The Sprint NAP, located in Pennsauken, NJ, is currently based on
     FDDI.  An FDDI ring (Two Cisco concentrators) was operational on
     August 31.  A DEC GigaSwitch, which will provide substantially more
     aggregate bandwidth, has been prooposed as an upgrade to the NAP to
     address expected traffic growth in early 1995. The Gigaswitch is
     currently at the NAP and discussions between Sprint and the NSF are
     underway.  The NAP team is currently investigating possible
     alternatives beyond the Gigaswitch that will address continued
     increases in NAP traffic. The stated migration path for the Sprint
     NAP will lead to an ATM-based strategy. Among other advantages this
     is the only known way to achieve NSP to NSP connections over the
     NAP at rates of 150Mbps, 622Mbps and beyond. As stated at the IETF
     the continued emphasis at the Sprint NAP will be reliable
     operation.

     ANS and MCI have DS-3 circuits connecting to routers at the Sprint
     NAP.  They are peering with each other and are exchanging
     production traffic with each other.  The ANS link and T3-ENSS
     router were operational September 13; the MCI link and Cisco 7010
     router were operational September 15.  ANS and MCI began peering
     with each other on October 21.

     SprintLink began peering sessions with ANS and MCI, but did not
     begin exchanging traffic across the NAP pending the implementation
     of DS3 level connections. SprintLink completed installation of dual
     DS-3 circuits to the Sprint NAP in early Dec. (the links provide
     diverse connectivity to the SprintLink Chicago and Wash. D.C.
     nodes) and is expected to be exchanging traffic with other NAP NSPs
     by at least early Jan.

     CERFnet has an ATM DS3 connection to the Sprint NAP. This
     connection terminates at a Digital Link DL-3200 ATM DSU and a Cisco
     7010 at the NAP.  The CERFnet connection to the NAP was operational
     November 8.  CERFnet and Sprint are currently testing this
     connection.

     The Routing Arbiter workstation is at the Sprint NAP also and is
     expected to begin production service pending implementation of the
     Gisgaswitch (which will allow MAC level filtering for the RA
     workstation.)

     Five additional organizations have expressed interest in
     connectivity to the Sprint NAP, discussions are underway.

   of the last meeting.  Parallel working group sessions started after
   the general plenaries.  Approximately 75 people attended.

General Plenary

   1.  RIPE NCC Report - Daniel Karrenberg

      There have been changes in personnel and workload developments
      since the last RIPE meeting.  This has lead to a temporary
      curtailing of RIPE NCC services.  Prioritizing of tasks has not
      solved the workload and personnel problems.  If the problems are
      not resolved, there will have to be a permanent curtailment of NCC
      activities.  Additional discussion of this topic is contained
      below in section 3.

      Daniel reported that the RIPE DNS host count has almost doubled in
      one year.  It is projected to hit one million by the end of this
      year.  The growth of the number of local IRs (Internet Registries)
      has been a real surprise.  The increasing numbers of local IRs has
      been good and bad.  The growth is much more than expected.  The
      growth curve of local IRs seems parallel to the growth of the host
      curve.  The new provider registries need more support and guidance
      from the NCC than those having a long Internet history.  It is
      close to getting out of hand, but new registries should provide
      more income for the NCC.

      Registry workload growth is close to becoming out of control.  The
      hostmaster alone now logs at least 30+ electronic mail messages a
      day, not counting phone calls and fax requests.  A tendency to
      "rubber stamp" incoming requests is growing.  This is resulting in
      a quality control problem.  The NCC doesn't want to continue to
      rubber stamp requests, as mistakes tend to be made in the process.
      Yet, there is not enough time to support local IRs, nor is there
      time to adapt and produce documentation.  There is NCC staff burn

      out, as there is much more than 100% routine duties to be
      performed each day.  This has turned into a vicious circle.

      Currently, personnel concerns are of utmost importance.  Geza
      Turchanyi's trainee period with the NCC ended July 15th, and he
      has returned to Hungary.  Mirjam Kuhne joined 1 July 1994 as a
      junior administrative staff member.  The current staffing level is
      3.5 FTE (Full Time Equivalent).  The NCC needs 5 FTEs now.  The
      real need is somewhat higher.  The core staffing situation of the
      NCC has not changed since the first of this year.  The Routing
      Registry needs 1 FTE when PRIDE (Policy Based Routing
      Implementation and Deployment in Europe) ends.  Tony Bates is
      leaving when the PRIDE project is completed.

      Unfortunately, the NCC's personnel problems have lead to a
      curtailment of services.  This includes writing and publication of
      documents, and database and registry support and maintenance.
      Database curtailment of services include the maintenance of RIPE
      handles, exchanges with other regional registries, making the
      database classless (This work is performed by PRIDE.), and
      maintenance/checking of database contents.  The registry services
      have cutdown support for local registries and coordination with
      other regional registries.  Other services that have been
      curtailed include Quarterly Reports (the last one was published
      January 1994), technical development activities, and special
      projects.

      What to do?  Daniel explained that the core budget will need to
      double.  Currently, there is 250,000 ECUs available.  The need is
      500,000 ECUs.  There needs to be action as soon as possible.  The
      RIPE NCC will not be able to hire additional personnel unless they
      obtain funding.  Setting up a charging scheme has not been an easy
      task.

      The RIPE NCC needs at least one more engineer as soon as possible.
      Otherwise, they will definately curtail services.  A decision on
      this is needed quickly.  Funding and RARE payroll exposure is a
      problem.  Also, there needs to be one additional engineer to
      maintain the Routing Registry.  The PRIDE project will end in
      October 1994.  There is a need to continue to maintain the
      registry content, database, and tool maintenance.  So far, there
      have been no new developments and a decision on this is needed.
      Another engineer will be need to be hired in 1995 because of
      continued growth.  Daniel's conclusions are that the RIPE NCC core
      services need additional staff immediately.  Additional funding
      for the needed staff resources must be secured.  Service providers
      need to decide whether they want the Routing Registry maintained.
      Quality staff needs to be found.

   2.  Policy Based Routing Implementation and Deployment in Europe
       (PRIDE) - Tony Bates

      The PRIDE project is ending in October 1994.  There have been
      several minor releases since the last meeting.  PRIDE-TOOLS-1.0.7
      is the current release which includes:

            "prpath"
            AS-MACRO support
            a "mazpand" tool which will expand macros for you
            lots of bug fixes

      For more information see:
      ftp://ftp.ripe.net/pride/tools/pride.tools.ps.tar.Z

      The PRIDE guide has been completed.  It is at
      ftp.ripe.net/pride/docs/guide-1.0.ps.tar.Z

      PRIDE's second guide will depend upon RIPE-81++ developments.
      There has been a large amount of effort put into the development
      of RIPE-81++.  The new plan incorporates many database issues,
      authorizations and a transition plan.  RIPE is working with other
      registry providers, also.

      PRIDE's first course was given in Amsterdam last May and was
      considered useful.  A report is available on
      ftp.ripe.net/pride/report/pride-report4.ps

      More courses are planned in October in Vienna, London, and Pisa.
      PRIDE has been reasonably busy.  Database maintenance is the most
      work.

   3.  RIPE Reorganization - Rob Blokzijl

      Rob announced the intent of RIPE separating from RARE*.  He has
      been researching this subject since the beginning of summer.
      Currently, RARE underwrites the RIPE NCC based on a 1984 funding
      level.  A more formal management should be created.  RARE should
      take the initiative to establish a lightweight management
      structure, partners, etc.  A RARE meeting will be held on 21
      September in Amsterdam.  Those organizations that are interested
      in providing/taking part in funding issues should attend, or send
      a letter of intent to fund the RIPE NCC to RARE.

      Rob feels at this point in time that the RIPE NCC should be on its
      own feet.  The creation of a European company called the RIPE NCC
      is being seriously investigated.  He looked into this over the
      summer.  It will cost money to do accomplish this endeavor.  A

Internet Monthly Report                                    December 1994


      legal structure needs to be created.  EUnet has supplied some
      legal assistance, including providing funding to help with the
      legal transition procedures.  There has also been help from the
      EBONE folks, who have already gone through this excercise.  Rob
      encouraged all attendees to go to their local legal
      representatives for advice as each RIPE member nation has its own
      set of laws.  Rob pointed out that the EEG (European Economic
      Group) is a lightweight management group.  This group is an
      example of what RIPE should be looking at during the restructuring
      process.

      This separation from RARE will result in RIPE becoming an
      impartial and independent entity.  It will enable the RIPE NCC to
      do more of its own management, business plan, etc.  The current
      situation is different then the proposed end result.

      What about the legal implications and the RIPE NCC?  Rob stated
      that as a company, the RIPE NCC cannot be based on one national
      law, as RIPE members come from different countries.  What is the
      impact on the RIPE budget?  This kind of proposed financial
      network can provide for a set of members to assist in the funding,
      not just a subset of RARE funding.  RIPE itself as an organization
      will be in for a change as well.

      The RIPE restructuring and reorganization will need to find out
      how this will reflect legally in various countries first.  A major
      concern is that RIPE and the RIPE NCC have been operating on a low
      overhead.  Members of RIPE have been sending money to RARE to fund
      RIPE.  This is not working any more.  The problem is not whether
      this is bad or not, it is one of a formal relationship with
      someone.  Need to set up the following:

         1) Find out legal implications of RIPE restructuring and
            reorganization.

         2) set up a company and a charging scheme

      A question and answer session followed.

         1) What is the best way to do this?

         2) Are there any other possibilities?

         3) Are thre any other formal ways without forming a company?

         4) There are concerns about creating something new that may be
            a waste of resources.

Internet Monthly Report                                    December 1994


      Rob stated that commercial service providers are making noises
      that they cannot justify putting money into the RIPE NCC unless a
      more formal structure is developed.  An effort needs to be made to
      investigate this.  Additional research needs to be completed by
      the next RIPE meeting, if RIPE attendees want to do this.

      *NOTE: As of October 1994, RARE and EARN have merged to form
      TERENA (Trans-European Research and Education Network
      Association).

   4. RIPE Meeting Structure

      Daniel expressed his likes/dislikes about the current RIPE meeting
      agenda.  He feels that there are too many meetings (three times a
      year) and that they are too long in duration.  There are also too
      many overlaps with the working groups that meet.  What exactly do
      we have the RIPE meetings for?  What do the RIPE attendees want?
      The response from the group is that they would like formal
      presentation plenaries, reports on current RIPE documentation, and
      information disemmination.  All felt that the working groups are
      actually doing some work and accomplishing goals.

      An idea was presented to shorten the agenda to two days.

      Day 1 - start in the afternoon, with presentations and reports
              from working groups.

      Day 2 - technical decisions (not managerial) from previous day or
              between meetings

      "Day 0" extension is working group meeting time.  It is proposed
      that this be an outside agenda of the RIPE meetings, either before
      or after meetings in conjunction with RIPE meetings and in between
      meetings of RIPE.  It would be up to the working groups to create
      their meetings, work via an agenda, then report.  What about going
      to just two meetings a year?  It was voiced that RIPE should try
      the new agenda structure first.

   5.  European Operators Forum (EOF)

      Rob stated that RIPE's Network Operations working group was
      discontinued after EBONE came to life.  The EBONE Action Team did
      not survive the latest EBONE restructuring.  The European IEPG
      (Internet Engingeerig Planning Group) did not take off earlier
      this year as planned.  A new forum was created for network
      operations, which focussed on common engineering and operations.
      The acting chair is Peter Lothberg.  What do they do?  What are
      they planning?  This group is not a Pan-European organization.  It

Internet Monthly Report                                    December 1994


      has agreed to work with RIPE.

      Peter gave a presentation on EOF.  EOF is to be a forum focussed
      on the daily operation and coordination running of IP networks in
      Europe.  If all goes well, it can expand on a global scope.  The
      first EOF meeting was in Amsterdam.  The second meeting was in
      Paris.  The third meeting was held before the RIPE meeting in
      Lisbon, with 32 attendees.  EOF has started discussing
      interconnection agreements, defining strawman proposals on how new
      people can connect, change points, routing problems, CIDR issues,
      and mae-east++ (or upgrade).  The primary focus of this group is
      to keep IP Europe communicating with each other.  Their mailing
      list is eware-list@ripe.net.  The Lisbon EOF meeting agenda
      included traffic and routing exchange arrangements between network
      service providers, CIDR routes, how to do routing over exchange
      points without causing global problems, and development of an EOF
      charter as a RIPE oriented working group.  The next EOF meeting
      will be in November in the UK.

Routing Working Group Session

   RIPE-81++ document overview
   Read the following draft document:
   URL ftp://ftp.ripe.net/ripe/drafts/ripe-81++.{txt,ps}

      - only changes not a tutorial of RIPE-81++

      - basic agreed changes

      - major changes - the component attribute

   The component attribute idea is drawn around CIDR.  Comments are it
   is too difficult to understand and too difficult to maintain.  A
   "withdrawn" attribute is an aid in CIDR when a more specific route is
   withdrawn.  "Hole" attribute indicates parts of address space where
   there is no connectivity.

   Clarification of evaluation of operations.  Clarifies the association
   and semantics of operators.  The "as-name" attribute is a new cloud.
   It needs to be optimal for transition.  "interas-in and interas-out"
   are the outstanding issues.

   The above are the major changes to the RIPE-81++ document since the
   last draft.  Closure needs to be made at this meeting on the RIPE-
   81++ working paper.

                              Link 2


   RIPE-81++ changes are used to distinguish local from global AS-AS
   policy.  The basic idea being syntax fist.  Need to identify the link
   of peer session somehow.

   There are three issues:

            - "localas"

            - "ifaddr"

            - "masks"

   Should <local-id> and <remote-id> be "mandatory" or "optional"?  The
   reasons for "mandatory" is that one should know both ends of the peer
   session useful for tools.  The reasons for "optional" is that people
   don't know remote-id or won't update.

      interas-in (praf=cost) or (praf-med)
      interas-out (metric-out=metric-value) =

   If interas-in and interas-out attributes are used, then it is
   mandatory to have "as-in" and "as-out" attributes registered.
   Reasons for: the global policy on this is that it should always be
   registers.  Only ASs are concerned about his local information and
   should be seen purely as local and not general policy.  There is a
   need to be able to specify more than just a cost as in "as-in" and
   "as-out".  Reasons against: duplication (possible discrepancies).  It
   is not clear if as-in, as-out represents policy.

   The route object question still has not been resolved.  An "inet-ir"
   object is a simple object to describe an "internet" router.  The

Internet Monthly Report                                    December 1994


   motivation is that it aids in building configuration and added
   information.

      - "localas" -  describes where an AS router resides in

      - "ifaddr" - list of all interface addresses

      - adding "masks"

      - "peer" - details all (interior [optional] and exterior
                 peerings), format

      - Routing protocol - EGP, BGP, BGP4, IBGP4, IDRP, IGP or other
                           BGP4 distinctions for CIDR

      - "localas" for "faking" AS announcements

   A suggestion was made to publish this document as a RIPE document
   first, and obtain feedback.  Also submit the document to the RFC
   Editor requesting it be published as an Informational RFC in order to
   obtain further comments.

Database Working Group Session - Marten Tempstra

   This working group focussed on a discussion of the RIPE Database
   Transition Plan.  The RIPE database is no longer one big file.  Now,
   every object type has its own file.  The database index is in place.
   Authorization access is in place including additional options on
   template mode, type selections, fastnraw, non-recursive, no RIPE-81++
   syntacial sugar, etc.  A short review followed on the Database
   Working Group's current set of documents.

   1.  RIPE Database Authorization Aspects Report - Daniel Karrenberg

      Daniel reported that notification and authorization is fully
      operational.  All current objects in the RIPE Database are valid.
      The first item for objects is to put attributes in them that point
      to maintainer object.  Notifications are easier with this
      maintainer object.  The name must be unique, with the usual set of
      contact persons.  The object itself will be maintained by the RIPE
      NCC, also.  Notification will also happen if the object itself is
      changed from time to time.  Stronger authentication is in place.
      Any update of this object must now be preceded by a line of the
      form.  Multiple authentication methods can be used in the same
      maintainer object.  The Routing Registry is the guardian of the
      communities and therefore ASs are notified of any creation, update
      or deletions of any "route" referencing them.  The maintainer of
      ":all routes" notified of another instance of exactly the same

Connectivity Working Group Session - Milan Sterba

   1.  CEENET

      A CEENET (Central East European Net) update was presented by Jan
      Gunograd.  CEENET started in 1991 in four countries: Czech
      Republic/Solvakia, Poland, Hungary, and Romania.  Its membership
      now includes twelve countries.  There will be a meeting in October
      1994 for CEENET to talk about future financing.  The key issue is
      the financial support from the EC (European Community) and a call
      for management of the project.

   2.  DFN/EUNET/DANTE Report - No technical activity has started up
       yet.

      Milan asked if there was an attendee who could provide the group a
      DANTE report regarding their efforts in the Central European area.
      There was not a representative available at this session.
      However, there seems to be some evidence that DANTE is working on
      an extension of a higher speed background for Central Europe and
      also, for all of Europe.

   3.  Regional Updates Report

      Milan asked the working group attendees if there were any major
      changes or events since the last RIPE meeting in their respective
      countries.  He stated that he would especially like to know about
      newly connected countries.

      Bulgaria
         No representative present to report.

      Czech Republic
         Jan reported that the link that was established for the INET
         Conference in Prague last June is still in place.  He hopes it
         will stay until the CEENET October meeting in Budapest.  No
         more contract or details have been made.  There is also a
         128kps line in Vienna-Prague on the EBONE.  The Czech Republic
         connection has significantly improved sine the last RIPE
         meeting.

      Hungary
         Some new cities have connected to IPnet internally in Hungary.
         Other major cities will be connected in the next two months.
         Four 64kps lines from Vienna's EBONE are connected to
         interfaces on Europanet Bone.  Hungary has asked for an upgrade



Cooper                                                         [Page 45]

Internet Monthly Report                                    December 1994


         to 256kps lines from the Vienna EBONE.  It has been agreed that
         two lines of the current four 64kps lines will be upgraded to
         256kps.  DANTE Europanet has also approved of this upgrade.  It
         has been confirmed that EBONE connectivity will be included in
         the upgrade.

      Baltic States

         Estonia - 128kps line to Helsinki, 128kps line to Stockholm
         Latvia - 65kps lines going to Helsinki and Germany
         Lithuania - 64kps line to Oslo

         The Baltnet program was established by the Scandinavians.
         Capacity will double by this time next year.

      Slovakia
         Last April/May two lines were upgraded to 64kps from Prague.
         One of the lines is covered by a new budget.

      Russia
         There are two lines available, one in Prague (64kps) and one in
         Vienna.  There is a Russia connection via a "radio-msu"
         satellite/microwave based at Moscow State University.  There
         are other plans to connect additional sites in Moscow.  These
         are still under discussion, so there will not be just one line.
         There was a question if any of the other Russian states will be
         included, and the answer was yes, but it has not been fully
         confirmed.

         Rob presented the above diagram and led a discussion about the
         currrent connectivity in Russia.  He mentioned that initally,
         there was was a problem with the power supply in Yerphl.  The
         power was 43 Hertz!  Since its initial setup, Yerphl's power
         has been upgraded.  The Armenia Foundation funded the upgrade
         and the line.

         Rob reported on the new developments in the Moscow area.  A new
         proposal has just been announced that describes a Moscow
         metropolitan network with a 2Mb line, with a 28kps line to
         downtown Moscow.  The idea is to connect the Science Institute
         all together and to have external links.  The termination point
         will be Moscow State University, using the same satellite NSK.
         Funding is being provided by the International Science
         Foundation (ISF), the Soros Foundation and the Department of
         Energy of the United States.  A NASA/ESNET link will also be
         included.  These agreements are verbally in place, but it's
         hard to write them down.  Rob stressed that the point is as
         long as the agreements work between all parties concerned, they
         are okay.  The last time around, there was a deadlock with
         fiber optic connectivity.  It is still deadlocked.  There are
         plans to install a 64kps line between Kiev and Potsdam.

      Poland, Romania, and Slovania Reports
         No representatives were present to report.

   4.  CDS Update - the Connectivity Document - Milan Sterba

      Milan requested that the attendees send a CDS sheet describing
      their network to <cds-editor@ripe.net>.  He felt that they should
      make their information known since they are information providers.
      Milan said that up until now, there are very few entries.  Entries
      include Bulgaria, the Czech Repulbic, DANTE, France, Poland, and
      Slovakia.  Milan would like to see it more populated.  There is a
      need for additional submissions.

   5.  CEE Discussion

      Discussion of the stagnation of CEE (Central East European)
      networking.

      Milan stated that he might be mistaken, but checked some figures.
      Currently, he sees three groups of countries/classes:

      1) Stable growth - most countries fit into this
         (Ukraine, Russia, Slovenia, Romania, Lativa, Hungary)

Internet Monthly Report                                    December 1994


      2) Astronomical growth - new countries with rapid growth
         (Bulgaria, Lithuania)

      3) Plateau growth - some networks reaching a plateau, not
         "stagnation", per se
         (Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia)

   The Future of the RIPE Connectivity Working Group

      Milan requested feedback on the mission and future of this working
      group.  General consensus is that this group is still extremely
      useful, even with the new RIPE program.

General Plenary

   During the last day of the RIPE meetings, there was an announcement
   of a new NCC Activity - Routing Registry Maintenance.  Its intent is
   to:

      - encourage and support service provides to use the routing
        registry

      - actively find gaps in covers, courses, reports, etc.

      - maintain PRIDE tools

      - coordinate with other routing registries

      - identify and propose needed extensions
