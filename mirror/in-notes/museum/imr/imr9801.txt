INTERNET MONTHLY REPORTS
------------------------

The purpose of these reports is to communicate to the Internet Research
Group the accomplishments, milestones reached, or problems discovered by
the participating organizations.

Each organization is expected to submit a 1/2 page report on the first
business day of the month describing the previous month's activities.
These reports should be submitted via network mail to "IMR-ED@ISI.EDU".

The Internet Monthly Report mailing list is now managed by MajorDomo at
ISI.EDU.  The announcements of new issues on the Internet Monthly Report
are sent to the IETF-Announce list and to this IMR list.

Requests to be ADDED or DELETED from the Internet Monthly report list
should be sent to "majordomo@isi.edu" with the message body either
"subscribe imr" or "unsubscribe imr".

Details on obtaining the current IMR, or back issues, via FTP or EMAIL
may be obtained by sending an EMAIL message to "rfc-info@ISI.EDU" with
the message body "help: ways_to_get_imrs".  For example:

     Since the InterNIC Directory and Database Services project will end
     at the end of March, we have stopped taking new entries for our
     Directory of Directories.  Only InterNIC Directory and Database
     Services will end at that time; InterNIC Registration Services will
     continue operation.

THE US DOMAIN REGISTRY
-------------------------

     The US Domain registration form is now available online at
     http://www.isi.edu/us-domain.

     The US Domain has the maps of all the delegated special domains
     online at http://www.isi.edu/us-domain.

     Some of the processing of the requests to the third level domain
     name is now automated. In particular, most requests to register
     names in localities already delegated are automatically forwarded
     to the administrator of that locality.

     Recent announcements:

     1. A new policy has been added to avoid several cases of
     misleading, erroneous, and outright false information provided on
     registration applications.

     One situation that occurs is that one individual represents himself
     as several distinct companies in order to bypass some limitations
     on the number of delegations allowed (e.g., the 50/500 rule).

     Another situation is that with the requirement to provide a
     government employee as the administrative contact for a locality
     delegation.  Some applications have been received with a government
     employee's contact information but that person has no idea that
     such an application has been submitted.  Some applications provide
     contact information for an individual that knows what is going on
     but is not an employee of the locality government.  Still other
     applications have been received where the administrative contact
     information is fictional.





Ramos                                                          [Page 16]

Internet Monthly Report                                     January 1998


     The US Domain Administration may choose to verify any or all of the
     information on registration applications (including the
     administrative contact) and if it is determined that the an
     application contains false of substantially misleading information
     that application may be denied, or if already acted on the
     delegation may be revoked, and in either case all other delegations
     made to the party submitting the false or misleading application
     may also be revoked.

     2. A total of about 2000 locality domains that were delegated to
     several domain name managers have been returned to the US Domain
     administrator.  These localities will be made available for
     redelegation in the coming months.

     3. For delegations made after 1-Jul-97, it is assumed by the US
     Domain Administrator that every applicant for the delegation (or
     redelegation) of a locality name has the written agreement of the
     legitimate government for that locality for the applicant to manage
     the domain name of that locality.

     Evidience of such an agreement does not need to be presented at the
     time of delegation (except that the administrative contact on the
     application template must be the government representative).
     However, if the delegation is later challenged or contested, the
     manager of the locality domain must produce the agreement.  Failure
     to do so will most likely result in the transfer of the management
     of the locality domain to another manager that does have such an
     agreement.

     If there is a dispute as to what is the legitimate government for a
     locality is and who may act for it, the league of cities or
     association of municipalities that each state (as recognized by the
     National League of Cities) may be asked to assist in resolving such
     disputes.

     In some places there are overlapping jurisdictions with the same
     name (for example, the city of Los Angeles and the county of Los
     Angeles).  In such cases, the higher level government should have
     priority.  A new policy has been added regarding the charges for
     the domain name passed on during delegation.  The administrator of
     the locality has to notify one year in advance before charging for
     those domains.

     4. The US Domain administrator no longer makes direct registrations
     of hosts, and only makes delegations of third or fourth level
     domain names (such as localities).

MERIT INTERNET ENGINEERING
--------------------------

     This report summarizes January 1998 activities of Merit's Internet
     Engineering group on behalf of the Routing Arbiter (RA) service and
     other projects.

     The Routing Arbiter project, a partnership between Merit Network,
     Inc., and the University of Southern California Information
     Sciences Institute, was launched in 1994 as one of several NSFNET
     follow-on projects supported by the National Science Foundation.
     In the following years, the RA successfully deployed Route Server





Ramos                                                          [Page 19]

Internet Monthly Report                                     January 1998


     systems to facilitate routing information exchange at the Network
     Access Points, and operated the Routing Arbiter Database as an
     important source of information for global policy routing.

     Since the 1995 transition from the NSFNET to a commercial
     networking infrastructure, NSF has focused its networking support
     on network research and development efforts, rather than
     operational activities such as the RADB and the Route Servers.  In
     late 1996, on NSF's recommendation, Route Server operations moved
     from NSF sponsorship to private funding, with several U.S. exchange
     point operators taking over support of the Route Servers (see the
     Route Server Next Generation Web pages, http://www.rsng.net).
     Similarly, the National Science Foundation has now determined that
     there is sufficient support in the community to provide funding for
     the operation of the Routing Arbiter Database, and has asked Merit
     to complete a transition from federal funds to an alternative
     funding model by the end of March 1998.

     Merit wishes to thank those network service providers that have
     already committed financial resources to sustaining RADB
     operations. Additional resources are still needed, however, to
     ensure that the RADB continues to operate until the routing
     community completes its planned transition to a distributed routing
     registry model.  Merit and other organizations participating in
     global routing plans to phase out centralized registries, such as
     the RADB, and move to a distributed registry on or about March 31,
     1999.

     If your organization can assist in supporting the RADB through this
     transition, please contact Merit at (734) 764-9430 and ask for Bill
     Norton, Internet Engineering Manager, or Kitty Bridges, Associate
     Director for National Networking.  You can also send e-mail to
     wbn@merit.edu and bridges@merit.edu.

     attended the 29th RIPE meeting in Amsterdam.  At the Routing
     Working Group, Winters gave a presentation titled "Using Internet
     Routing Announcements to Identify Incorrect Internet Routing
     Registry Data."

     * New RFCs added to queue throughout the month

     The Requests for Comments (RFCs) are a series of notes, started in
     1969, about the Internet (originally the ARPANET). The notes
     discuss many aspects of computing and computer communication
     focusing in networking protocols, procedures, programs, and
     concepts, but also including meeting notes, opinion, and sometimes
     humor. The specification documents of the Internet protocol suite,
     as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and its
     steering group (the IESG), are published as RFCs.



Ramos                                                          [Page 21]

Internet Monthly Report                                     January 1998


     RFCs-to-be are edited by the RFC Editor.  RFCs enter the RFC
     Editor's work queue either by an action of the IESG or by
     independent submission.  Most independent submissions are referred
     to the IESG to check for overlap with IETF work.  The IESG might
     put a hold on a document to gather more input from its members.
     The wait for an RFC to be published varies as there can be
     unforeseen complications (typically editorial matters that need
     clarification from the author).  Documents can be removed from the
     publication queue if they are found to be insufficient or incorrect
     or if the IESG asks the author to join work already in progress in
     the IETF.
