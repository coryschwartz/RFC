INTERNET MONTHLY REPORTS
------------------------

The purpose of these reports is to communicate to the Internet Research
Group the accomplishments, milestones reached, or problems discovered by
the participating organizations.

     This report is for Internet information purposes only, and is not
     to be quoted in other publications without permission from the
     submitter.

Each organization is expected to submit a 1/2 page report on the first
business day of the month describing the previous month's activities.

These reports should be submitted via network mail to:

     Ann Westine Cooper (Cooper@ISI.EDU)

     NSF Regional reports - To obtain the procedure describing how to
     submit information for the Internet Monthly Report, send an email
     message to mailserv@is.internic.net and put "send imr-procedure" in
     the body of the message (add only that one line; do not put a
     signature).

Requests to be added or deleted from the Internet Monthly report list
should be sent to "imr-request@isi.edu".

     Details on obtaining the current IMR, or back issues, via FTP or
     EMAIL may be obtained by sending an EMAIL message to "rfc-
     info@ISI.EDU" with the message body "help: ways_to_get_imrs".  For
     example:

             To: rfc-info@ISI.EDU

INTERNET ENGINEERING REPORTS
----------------------------

     1. The next IETF meeting will be held in San Jose, California from
        December 5-9, 1994. In fact, by the time this IMR is
        distributed, logistic information will have already been posted
        to the IETF-Announcement list. Following the San Jose meeting,
        the IETF will be meeting in Danvers (a suburb of Boston) from
        April 3-7, 1995.

        The summer 1995 IETF meeting will be held in Stockholm, Sweden
        from July 17-21, 1995. Closing out the year, it looks like the
        fall/winter meeting will be in Dallas, Texas. Once all the
        arrangements have been made, notifications will be sent to the
        IETF Announcement list.

        Remember that information on future IETF meetings can be always
        be found in the file 0mtg-sites.txt which is located on the IETF
        shadow directories. This information can also be viewed from the
        IETF Home Page on the Web. The URL is:

           http://www.ietf.cnri.reston.va.us/home.html

     2. The minutes of the IESG teleconferences have been publicly
        available on the IETF Shadow directories since 1991. These files
        are placed in the /ftp/iesg directory. They can also be accessed
        via the IETF Home Page on the Web.

        The following IESG minutes have been added:

           August 25, 1994 (iesg.94-08-25)
           September 8, 1995 (iesg.94-09-08)

INTERNET PROJECTS
-----------------

ANSNET/NSFNET BACKBONE ENGINEERING
----------------------------------

     Network Status Summary
     =======================

     ANSnet total packet traffic increased by about 4% in September '94.
     An decrease in the ANSnet forwarding table size of .36% was
     observed during the month of September.

     August Backbone Traffic Statistics
     ==================================

     The total inbound packet count for the ANSnet (measured using SNMP
     interface counters) was 70,954,833,675 on T3 ENSS interfaces, up
     4.04% from August.  The total packet count into the network
     including all ENSS serial interfaces was 84,235,044,204 up 3.98%
     from August.

     Router Forwarding Table Statistics
     ===================================

     The maximum number of destinations announced to ANSnet during
     September was 18,778 down .36% from August.

     The number of network destinations configured for announcement to
     the ANSnet but never announced (silent nets) during September was
     18,817

     BGP-4/CIDR Deployment Status
     ============================

     As of September 6th '94, we have observed the withdrawal of 8,793
     class based destinations from the ANSnet router forwarding tables
     that are now represented by 1,745 configured aggregates.  Among
     these configured aggregates:

         1,480 of these are top-level aggregates (not nested in another
         aggregate).

         1,176 of these are actively announced to ANSnet.

         954 of these have at least one subnet configured (the other
         196 may be saving the Internet future subnet
         announcements).

Internet Monthly Report                                   September 1994


         849 of these have resulted in the withdrawal of at least one
         configured more specific route.

         833 of these have resulted in the withdrawal of 50% of their
         configured more specific routes.

         800 of these have resulted in the withdrawal of most (80%+)
         of their more specific routes.

     For up-to-date information is available from merit.edu:
     pub/nsfnet/cidr/cidr-savings.

     For further details on these CIDR aggregates, see
     merit.edu:pub/nsfnet/cidr/nestings.announced for full listings.

     Routing Stability Measured on the T3 Network
     ============================================

     Internal routing stability measurements are made by monitoring
     short term disconnect times (disconnects of five minutes duration
     or less).  This is intended as a measure of overall system
     stability rather than complete connectivity.

     August was the most stable month recorded since this data was
     collected (since January 1993), with no software deployments and no
     major problems.  September was also quite stable.  An FDDI
     interface problem at the Washington DC POP was the most notable
     problem and the only problem effecting a core site.  The remaining
     problems were mostly end-node circuits.

     Monthly histograms of the number of nodes experiencing instability
     follows.  This month most of the nodes had under 15 minutes of
     instability.  All but CNSS58 had under 30 minutes of instability.
     During Septmeber, most of the nodes had under 15 minutes of
     instability.  All but CNSS58 had under 30 minutes of instability.
     The CNSS58 problems were due to Washington DC POP FDDI problems on
     September 23.  Again August was the best month on record with all
     of the nodes with any instability at all recording less than 15

     Internet resources. Accessible through gopher and the WorldWideWeb,
     the InterNIC InfoGuide replaces the older InterNIC information
     server, the InfoSource. The InfoGuide includes new services such as
     the Scout Report and an online hypertext version of the _NSF
     Network News_.

     To access the InterNIC InfoGuide, point your WorldWideWeb client

     NET-HAPPENINGS

     The net-happenings list is a service of InterNIC Information
     Services and the list moderator, Gleason Sackman of North Dakota's
     SENDIT Network. The purpose of the list is to distribute to the
     community announcements of interest to network staffers and end
     users. This includes conference announcements, call for papers,
     publications, newsletters, network tools updates, and network
     resources. Net-happenings is a moderated, announcements-only
     mailing list which gathers announcements from many Internet sources
     and concentrates them onto one list.

     To access net-happenings, point your gopher client to:

     THE SCOUT REPORT:
     A Weekly Summary of Internet Highlights

     Presently the Scout Report is now reaching over 10,000 subscribers
     and the HTML versions on the InfoGuide are receiving thousands of
     accesses each week.  A new mailing list was created for easier
     distribution of the HTML Scout Report, which is located at scout-
     report-html.

     The Scout Report is a weekly publication offered to the Internet
     community as a fast, convenient way to stay informed on network
     activities. Its purpose is to combine in one place the highlights
     of new resource announcements and other news which occurred on the
     Internet during the previous week.

     THE InterNIC SEMINAR SERIES

     "Learning the Whole Internet" is now available for users needing
     Internet training. The InterNIC has already presented a beta
     version of the course which includeded a copy of _The Whole
     Internet_ as well as class handouts of the PowerPoint presentation.
     Evaluations of this first course presentation were generally
     positive with attendees citing the hands-on exercises as especially
     valuable.

     The next phase of development will focus on creating notes to
     accompany the PowerPoint presentation.  This phase will make the
     course materials fully self-contained and will give even the newest
     Internet user comprehensive instruction on the Internet.
     Presentation of the course will procede in conjuction with
     production of the class notes.  This high quality course is ready
     to introduce the new Internet users to the networking community.

     INTERNIC DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES
     ----------------------------------------

     Our servers support a "guest" login which has a menu-oriented
     interface to most of our services.  When users exit this login,
     they are given the opportunity to enter comments and questions.
     Here are a few of the top questions with answers:

     - How can I get a login of my own on this system so I don't have to
     use guest?

     You don't need an individual login.  The information on our servers
     is freely available to all, and can be accessed a number of
     different ways.  In particular, the guest login is not simply for
     brief trial use; you can use it whenever you want to access our
     system.

     - How can I get more information about the services offered?

     If you log in to one of our servers as "guest", you will see
     information on how to access the tutorial.  If you use gopher to
     access our machine, select item 4 (InterNIC Directory and Database
     Services) on the first menu, then select 1 (About InterNIC
     Directory and Database Services).  You will now have a list of
     information items to choose from.  If you use FTP, change to the
     directory internic.info and look at the files whose names end in
     ".info".  If you are using mail to access our system, send a mail
     message to mailserv@ds.internic.net which includes the word "help"
     on a line by itself in the body of the message.

     - Why can't I find a given organization in the directory?

     Briefly, we support tools that access a number of different
     directory systems, but some organizations do not choose to make
     their directories available on line or do not include all of their
     employees/faculty/students in the directory.  Also, for security
     reasons, many organizations do not allow probes into their systems
     to try to find people.  There is more information on this issue in
     the June 1994 IMR.

     A reminder - if you would like to help the Internet community find
     a resource that you offer, send mail to admin@ds.internic.net and
     we will send information about listing your resource in the
     Directory of Directories.

     I.  Significant Events

     InterNIC Registration Services assigned over 6,000 network
     addresses and registered over 1,736 domains.  Three top-level
     country domains were registered during the month; Kazakhstan (KZ),
     Guyana (GY), Armenia (AM).

     II. Current Status

     During the month of September 1994, InterNIC Registration Services
     received communications as shown below.  The majority of the
     correspondence concerned the assignment and re-assignment of
     network numbers and the registration or change of domain names.

        E-mail        6,073  (hostmaster@internic.net)
        Postal/Fax      279  (primarily IP number requests)
        Phone         1,824

     The Registrations Services host computer supported a large volume
     of information retrieval requests during the month of September.

     ==========

     Work this month focused on X-Display server investigation and
     display device farbication.

     Last month, the network interfaces were shown capable of handling
     up to 60K pkt/sec, for circa 120 byte packets. A remaining question

     concerning the display device is the likely load in RPC/sec sent
     across the network to the display device.

     To that end an instrumented version of the X-Display server is
     being built that looks at the number of RasterOp() calls that are
     made to the screen frame buffer and the size of the pixel
     rectangles moved.  Figures obtained from this should be available
     by the end of October.

     The display testing platform design is nearly finished and the
     component memory and JPEG plug-in cards are being sent out for
     fabrication.

     Gregory Finn attended the ARPA Santa Fe investigators conference
     Sept.  25-28, where he gave a short presentation.

     MULTIMEDIA CONFERENCING =======================

     A new release of ISI's Multimedia Conference Control program (mmcc)
     for telephone-style conference calling over the Multicast Backbone
     (MBone) is available.  This fixes a bug which prohibited mmcc from
     spawning the current version 3.3 of the nv (network video) tool
     properly.  The new version (mmcc v.55a) can be retrieved via
     anonymous FTP from ftp.isi.edu:confctrl/mmcc as files "mmcc-
     *.tar.Z", and is available for the dec5k, decalpha, hp, sgi and
     sparc platforms.  The solaris version should follow shortly.

     RSVP PROJECT
     ============

     At ISI, Steve Berson has been concentrating on preparing an RSVP
     release, including the rsvp daemon, the API, and the sd, vat, and
     nv applications that MIT modified to call RSVP.  At the end of the
     month, a preliminary version of this release was provided to four
     sites, to debug the release.  General release is expected early in
     October.

     Meanwhile, work is in progress on two important updates to the
     first RSVP release.

         (1) An rsvpd <-> mrouted interface is being debugged Berson at
             ISI and by Ajit Thyagarajan (UDEL).  This interface will
             allow rsvpd to query the pruning version of mrouted (3.3)

             for multicast routes.

         (2) The RSVP API is being updated by Don Hoffman at Sun
             Microsystems and Bob Braden at ISI, to match the current
             protocol spec.

     John Wroclawski at MIT has been continuing to work with Steve
     Casner at ISI to prepare an up-to-date DARTnet kernel that will
     include the CSZ code.  Casner has recently made progress in
     producing a driver for the HSI/S board that is not subject to
     overruns; this is being merged with Wroclawski's double-buffered
     driver logic.  This should allow for the non-trivial CPU processing
     that is required by packet scheduling.

     Preparations are in progress to demonstrate RSVP on DARTnet from
     the MM '94 conference in San Francisco, October 19-20.

     Daniel Zappala at ISI continued investigating routing support for
     RSVP.  He has developed a preliminary architecture and designed
     routing functions to support hierarchical encoding using multiple
     multicast groups.

     Shai Herzog at ISI has completed the first part of his work on cost
     allocation and accounting for multicast/RSVP, and he is currently
     preparing it for publication.  The work defines the ground rules
     and tradeoffs in receiver-based cost allocation for multicast
     distributions.  He presented this work as part of the ISI seminar
     series and also as a thesis proposal in his qualifying exam at USC.

               >>========================================<<
                   NorthWestNet's Eighth Annual Meeting

                        "Passport to Productivity"

                          November 8-10, 1994
                   Portland Hilton ** Portland, Oregon
               >>========================================<<

     The Internet has fundamentally changed how we conduct our day-to-
     day business as well as how we plan for the future. These changes
     influence our productivity and, in some cases, redefine how we
     measure our successes. The dramatic expansion of services and the
     increasing diversity of connected organizations are critical
     factors. We will explore the nature of these changes, how the
     Internet influences and supports our daily activities, as well as
     how we perceive and plan for its role in our organizations. What is
     available today? What can we expect for tomorrow?

     The meeting will begin with plenary presentations by nationally-
     renowned speakers on Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday morning.
     Wednesday afternoon and all-day Thursday will be devoted to focus
     workshops and presentations in which attendees can explore issues
     affecting productivity including: Getting Connected, Internet
     Search Strategies, Security, Hot Technical Topics, Gopher
     Implementation, WWW Implementation, Laying Foundations for K-12 &
     the Internet, and Commercial Use of the Internet. In addition,
     there will be Birds of a Feather interest groups and ample
     opportunities to meet your fellow NorthWestNet attendees.

     Please send all correspondence regarding the Annual Meeting to
     info@nwnet.net or call the NorthWestNet offices, (206) 562-3000.

     report written and is available in:
     ftp://cs.ucl.ac.uk/darpa/hipparch-alf-ilp.ps

     2.  A multicast based shared text editor (called NT) has been
     implemented, based around ideas presented by Van Jacobson in his
     SIGCOMM 94 tutorial on multicast and multimedia on the Internet. This
     is partly described in the document above as well, and will be
     available shortly.
