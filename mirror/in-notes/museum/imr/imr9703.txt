INTERNET MONTHLY REPORTS
------------------------

The purpose of these reports is to communicate to the Internet Research
Group the accomplishments, milestones reached, or problems discovered by
the participating organizations.

Each organization is expected to submit a 1/2 page report on the first
business day of the month describing the previous month's activities.
These reports should be submitted via network mail to "IMR-ED@ISI.EDU".

`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

The Internet Monthly Report mailing list is now managed by MajorDomo at
ISI.EDU.  The announcements of new issues on the Internet Monthly Report
are sent to the IETF-Announce list and to this IMR list.

Requests to be ADDED or DELETED from the Internet Monthly report list
should be sent to "majordomo@isi.edu" with the message body either
"subscribe imr" or "unsubscribe imr".

Details on obtaining the current IMR, or back issues, via FTP or EMAIL
may be obtained by sending an EMAIL message to "rfc-info@ISI.EDU" with
the message body "help: ways_to_get_imrs".  For example:

        To: rfc-info@ISI.EDU
        Subject: getting imrs

                    Internet Monthly Report for March


  1. The first IETF meeting 1997 will be held in Memphis, Tennessee
     from April 7-10, 1997. Our local host is Federal Express.
     Following Memphis, the IETF returns to Europe for the summer
     meeting in Munich, Germany from August 11-15, 1997. Our host for
     this meeting will be Digi/ISOC.DE. The final meeting of the year
     will be held in the D.C. area, hosted by Newbridge.

     Once all arrangements have been made, notifications will be sent
     to the IETF Announcement list. Remember that information on
     future meetng sites can always be found in the file
     0mtg-sites.txt, located on the IETF shadow directories. Of
     course, this information is provided on the Web. The IETF's URL
     is:

                          http://www.ietf.org/

  2. The minutes of the IESG teleconferences be found on all the IETF
     shadow directories in the iesg directory.

     The following IESG minutes have been added:

       February 20, 1997 (iesg.97-02-20)

     INTERNIC DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES

     The Netfind Seed Database which is used by both Netfind and
     WebFinder is up to 1.2 million entries in March.  The database
     contains information that relates companies with the domain names
     they have registered.  The information is gathered from various
     registration databases around the world.  The April seed database
     is currently under construction and should have about 1.3 million
     entries.  The number of entries will fluctuate from time to time
     since we periodically check the validity of old entries and delete
     those that are no longer good.

     In late April we expect our primary server (ds0.internic.net) to
     move to a new physical location.  The server will be out of
     service for a few days during the move, but our other two
     production servers (ds1.internic.net and ds2.internic.net) will
     be available.  Up-to-date information on the planned availability
     of the server can be found in the greeting message when you
     telnet to the machine.

     As has been mentioned in the past, the best way to access our
     servers is via the generic name ds.internic.net.  This way you
     avoid attempting to access a machine that is down.

     A reminder - if you would like to help the Internet community find
     a resource that you offer, send mail to admin@ds.internic.net and
     we will send information about listing your resource in the
     Directory of Directories.  If you prefer, you can enter
     information about your resource in our WWW suggestion form.  The
     form can be reached through our Directory of Directories Web page
     at:

     THE US DOMAIN REGISTRY

     The US Domain has an online registration form available at
     http://www.isi.edu/us-domain.

     The US Domain administrator no longer makes direct registrations of
     hosts, and only makes delegations of third or fourth level domain
     names (such as localities).

     Some of the processing of the requests to the third level domain
     name is now automated. In particular, most requests to register
     names in localities already delegated are automatically forwarded
     to the administrator of that locality.

     A new policy has been added regarding the charges for the domain
     name passed on during delegation.  The administrator of the
     locality has to notify one year in advance before charging for
     those domains.

MERIT INTERNET ENGINEERING
--------------------------

     This report summarizes March 1997 activities of Merit's Internet
     Engineering group on behalf of the Routing Arbiter (RA) service and
     other projects.

     A reminder for Routing Arbiter Database users:  you will get the
     fastest turnaround for your database updates by sending them to
     auto-dbm@ra.net, which is machine-processed.  Only new Maintainer
     objects--as well as consulting questions--should go to db-
     admin@ra.net, which is read by the RADB support staff.

     Route Server Next Generation (RSng) operations are now up and
     running at the AADS NAP in Chicago.  One Sun Ultra running Solaris
     and one DEC Alpha running Digital Unix are in production at the
     site. RSng services went into production at the MAE-East
     interconnection point in January, and at the Digital Internet
     Exchange in February. The Route Servers were developed under the
     NSF-supported Routing Arbiter project, a partnership between Merit
     and the USC Information Sciences Institute.  RSng, a commercial
     follow-on activity, makes it possible for exchange point operators
     to purchase Route Server services from Merit.  For more
     information, see:

                             http://www.rsng.net

Internet Monthly Report                                       March 1997


     The National Science Foundation has awarded Merit and the
     University of Michigan a three-year follow-on grant for continued
     development of the Multi-Threaded Routing Toolkit.  Professor
     Farnam Jahanian of the U-M Electrical Engineering and Computer
     Science department is now a Co-PI on the project, along with Craig
     Labovitz of Merit. MRT, an extensible platform for developing and
     debugging routing protocols and routing code, now provides IPv6
     support for two additional platforms:

                 - WIDE IPv6 (hydrangea 970225, BSD/OS 2.1)
                       - NRL IPv6 (Sep96, NetBSD 1.2)

     For more information about MRT, see:

     * New RFCs added to queue throughout the month

     The Requests for Comments (RFCs) are a series of notes, started in
     1969, about the Internet (originally the ARPANET). The notes
     discuss many aspects of computing and computer communication
     focusing in networking protocols, procedures, programs, and
     concepts, but also including meeting notes, opinion, and sometimes
     humor. The specification documents of the Internet protocol suite,
     as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and its
     steering group (the IESG), are published as RFCs.

     RFCs-to-be are edited by the RFC Editor.  RFCs enter the RFC
     Editor's work queue either by an action of the IESG or by
     independent submission.  Most independent submissions are referred
     to the IESG to check for overlap with IETF work.  The IESG might
     put a hold on a document to gather more input from its members.
     The wait for an RFC to be published varies as there can be
     unforeseen complications (typically editorial matters that need
     clarification from the author).  Documents can be removed from the
     publication queue if they are found to be insufficient or incorrect
     or if the IESG asks the author to join work already in progress in
     the IETF.
