INTERNET MONTHLY REPORTS
------------------------

The purpose of these reports is to communicate to the Internet Research
Group the accomplishments, milestones reached, or problems discovered by
the participating organizations.

Each organization is expected to submit a 1/2 page report on the first
business day of the month describing the previous month's activities.
These reports should be submitted via network mail to "IMR-ED@ISI.EDU".

`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

The Internet Monthly Report mailing list is now managed by MajorDomo at
ISI.EDU.  The announcements of new issues on the Internet Monthly Report
are sent to the IETF-Announce list and to this IMR list.

Requests to be ADDED or DELETED from the Internet Monthly report list
should be sent to "majordomo@isi.edu" with the message body either
"subscribe imr" or "unsubscribe imr".

Details on obtaining the current IMR, or back issues, via FTP or EMAIL
may be obtained by sending an EMAIL message to "rfc-info@ISI.EDU" with
the message body "help: ways_to_get_imrs".  For example:

        To: rfc-info@ISI.EDU

                 Internet Monthly Report for June, 1997


  1. Let me remind everyone that the IETF returns to Europe for the
     summer meeting in Munich, Germany from August 11-15, 1997. Our
     hosts for this meeting will be Digi/ISOC.DE. The final meeting of
     the year will be held in Washington, DC from December 8-12, 1997.
     Our local host is Newbridge Networks.

     The IETF will meet in Los Angeles from March 30 - April, 3, 1998
     and then in Chicago August 24-28, but the Secretariat is still
     working out some details, albeit the final stage.

     Once all arrangements have been made, notifications will be sent
     to the IETF Announcement list. Remember that information on
     future meetng sites can always be found in the file
     0mtg-sites.txt, located on the IETF shadow directories. Of
     course, this information is provided on the Web. The IETF's URL
     is:

                          http://www.ietf.org/

  2. The minutes of the IESG teleconferences be found on all the IETF
     shadow directories in the iesg directory.

     The following IESG minutes have been added:

       May 22, 1997 (iesg.97-05-22)

  3. The IESG approved or recommended the following five Protocol
     Actions during the month of June, 1997:

     o Core Based Trees (CBT version 2) Multicast Routing Protocol
       Specification for publication as an Experimental Protocol.

     INTERNIC DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES

     The June Seed Database for Netfind has 1.62 million entries.  For
     full searching of this database, you should be using version 5.0.2
     of the Netfind source code.  Both the seed database and the Netfind
     source code are available at:

               http://www.internic.net/wp/netfind-seeddb.html

     Work is proceeding on a new version of Netfind, version 5.1.  We
     expect an alpha version to be available in July.  Netfind 5.1 will
     have the following features:

       - More complex Boolean queries
       - Use of DNS SRV records to help find directory resources
       - Direct LDAP interface
       - Cleaned up architecture that better distributes functions among
         modules

     THE US DOMAIN REGISTRY

     A new policy has been added regarding the locality delegation.  As
     of 1-Jul-97, it is assumed by the US Domain Administrator that
     every applicant for the delegation (or redelegation) of a locality
     name has the written agreement of the legitimate government for
     that locality for the applicant to manage the domain name of that
     locality.

     Evidience of such an agreement does not need to be presented at the
     time of delegation (except that the administrative contact on the
     application template must be the government representative).
     However, if the delegation is later challenged or contested, the
     manager of the locality domain must produce the agreement.  Failure
     to do so will most likely result in the transfer of the management
     of the locality domain to another manager that does have such an
     agreement.

     If there is a dispute as to what is the legitimate government for a
     locality is and who may act for it, the league of cities or
     association of municipalities that each state (as recognized by the
     National League of Cities) may be asked to assist in resolving such
     disputes.

     In some places there are overlapping jurisdictions with the same
     name (for example, the city of Los Angeles and the county of Los
     Angeles).  In such cases, the higher level government should have
     priority.

     The US Domain registration form is now available online at
     http://www.isi.edu/us-domain.

     The US Domain has the maps of all the delegated special domains
     online at http://www.isi.edu/us-domain.

     The US Domain administrator no longer makes direct registrations of
     hosts, and only makes delegations of third or fourth level domain
     names (such as localities).

     Some of the processing of the requests to the third level domain
     name is now automated. In particular, most requests to register
     names in localities already delegated are automatically forwarded
     to the administrator of that locality.

     A new policy has been added regarding the charges for the domain
     name passed on during delegation.  The administrator of the
     locality has to notify one year in advance before charging for
     those domains.

     of Internet Routing (PAIR) project. A collaboration among staff
     from the Routing Arbiter Database and Route Server Next Generation
     (RSng) projects, PAIR is developing tools that will help ISPs,
     network operators, and end users troubleshoot routing and policy
     problems in the Internet.  The tools were developed in response to
     requests from organizations peering with the RSng Route Servers,
     and greatly improve the peers' ability to track internal routing
     processes in the Route Server systems.

     Using PAIR, you can answer questions such as:

       -  Why isn't Provider A seeing any of my routes?
       -  What routes am I exporting to Provider B?
       -  According to the policy that Provider C registered in the IRR,
          what routes should it be exporting to my AS?

Internet Monthly Report                                        June 1997


     PAIR makes it possible to compare prescribed policy, i.e., policy
     registered in the Internet Routing Registry, with policy actually
     being configured in the Internet.  You can use the PAIR tools to:

       -  Learn how the policy in IRR AS Objects is processed and used
          to generate Route Server configuration files
       -  Gain an understanding of internal Route Server processes, such
          as policy configurations and state tables
       -  Pinpoint discrepancies between registered policy and actual
          routing announcements
       -  Troubleshoot global routing problems
       -  Identify stale or inaccurate data in the Internet Routing
          Registry

     Members of Merit's PAIR team are Jake Khuon, Jerry Winters, Abha
     Ahuja, and Tom Spindler.  For more information about the project,

     ------------------------------------------------------------

     With the final release of Scion, the popular network monitoring
     package, work is now complete on the one-year NetSCARF (Network
     Statistics Collection And Reporting Facility) Project.  Funded by a
     grant from the Resource Allocation Committee, the project has been
     extremely successful; to date, more than 1700 users in 70 countries
     have downloaded the Scion code.  Merit's NetSCARF team includes
     Bill Norton, project director, Andy Adams, lead software architect,
     and programmer Bill Siadak.

     Scion can be used by ISPs to collect network statistics and display
     performance reports on the World Wide Web.  The code, derived from
     the initial NSFNET project's statistics collection and reporting
     activities, is easy to install and run.  Every ten minutes, Scion's
     optimized SNMP library queries ISP routers for the values of
     variables such as sysUpTim and ifLastChange.  The library uses SNMP
     Version 1, and can be configured to use SNMPv2u, the User-based
     Security model for SNMPv2.  Scion's SNMP API is unique, in that it
     allows the developer to specify a list of nodes, a community string
     (or userid/authentication password/privacy password in the case of
     SNMPv2u), and a list of management objects to retrieve. All queries
     are then transmitted back- to-back, without waiting for any
     replies. The data collection activity is thus very fast, and the
     results highly synchronized.  Other publicly available SNMP
     libraries force applications to wait for a response (or timeout)
     for a given query before the next query can be issued to a
     different node.

     The raw SNMP statistics are pre-processed each evening, and the
     processed data delivered to CGI scripts, using what the developers
     believe to be the first public domain implementation of the OpStats
     (RFC 1856) client/server model.  Finally, ISP performance reports
     based on the 'cooked' data are displayed on the Web via the CGI
     scripts.

     ISPs can use the Scion code to automatically produce HTML graphs
     showing system uptime, interface uptime, and total network traffic
     measured in packets.  An advanced statistics Web page allows users
     to specify customized graphing parameters.

     Some of the new features contained in version 3.0 are:

       -  A moving strip chart that can be used to monitor traffic and
          display network data in real-time.
       -  A new graphical tool, scadmin, which allows you to associate
          nodes with arbitrary names instead of hard-to-remember IP
          addresses.  The tool can also be used to control access to
          each node on a per-user basis.
       -  Interfaces can be marked as internal or external to the
          network.
       -  Clickable graphs make it possible to zoom in on traffic graphs
          to display greater detail.

     Source and binaries are available for Solaris, SunOS, BSDI, AIX,
     and Windows NT.  For information on downloading version 3.0, see:

Internet Monthly Report                                        June 1997


     The Requests for Comments (RFCs) are a series of notes, started in
     1969, about the Internet (originally the ARPANET). The notes
     discuss many aspects of computing and computer communication
     focusing in networking protocols, procedures, programs, and
     concepts, but also including meeting notes, opinion, and sometimes
     humor. The specification documents of the Internet protocol suite,
     as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and its
     steering group (the IESG), are published as RFCs.

     RFCs-to-be are edited by the RFC Editor.  RFCs enter the RFC
     Editor's work queue either by an action of the IESG or by
     independent submission.  Most independent submissions are referred
     to the IESG to check for overlap with IETF work.  The IESG might
     put a hold on a document to gather more input from its members.
     The wait for an RFC to be published varies as there can be
     unforeseen complications (typically editorial matters that need
     clarification from the author).  Documents can be removed from the
     publication queue if they are found to be insufficient or incorrect
     or if the IESG asks the author to join work already in progress in
     the IETF.
