INTERNET ENGINEERING REPORTS

     1. Let me remind everyone that the next IETF meeting will be in
        Dallas, Texas from December 4-8, 1995, with the Newcomers'
        Orientation and Registration Reception being held on Sunday,
        December 3. The Dallas IETF meeting is being hosted by MCI.
        Logistic information has been posted to the IETF Announcement
        list, and is available on the IETF Web Page. The IETF meeting
        fee for the Dallas meeting will be $200.

        Following Dallas, the IETF will be meeting in Los Angeles,
        California from March 4-8, 1996. There will not be a local host
        for this meeting, but the terminal room facilities will be
        provided by Interop. Following Los Angeles, the IETF will be
        meeting in Montreal, Quebec, Canada from June 24-28, 1996. If
        this date looks familiar, that's because it is the same date as
        INET '96! Both groups will be meeting separately in the Montreal
        Convention Center.

        Once all the arrangements have been made, notifications will be
        sent to the IETF Announcement list. Remember that information
        on future IETF meetings can be always be found in the file
        0mtg-sites.txt which is located on the IETF shadow directories.
        This information can also be viewed from the IETF Home Page on
        the Web. The URL is:

                     http://www.ietf.cnri.reston.va.us


     2. The minutes of the IESG teleconferences have been publicly
        available on the IETF Shadow directories since 1991. These files
        are placed in the /ftp/iesg directory.

    SUMMARY:

    APRICOT is a forum for the exchange of technical know-how for In-
    ternet Service Providers and Network Operators

    OVERVIEW:

    The rapid growth of the Internet has brought many newcomers into
    positions of critical operational responsibility. They are ex-
    pected to be experts in the design, configuration, operation and
    maintenance of routers, terminal servers, WWW & UNIX servers, and
    a myriad of specific hardware/software systems. They must operate
    network management centers, customer support lines, and handle
    security incidents. They must liase with network registries, com-
    munications carriers, and their colleague operators. They must
    perform these duties efficiently even as their networks grow in-
    creasingly large and complex. Yet, the resources for learning the
    skills necessary to perform these tasks successfully are sparse
    and rarely provide specific information and examples.

    To address this critical need, the ASIA PACIFIC NETWORK INFORMA-
    TION (APNIC) has initiated the ASIA PACIFIC REGIONAL INTERNET
    CONFERENCE ON OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY (APRICOT).

     REGISTRATION SERVICES

     I.  Significant Events

     InterNIC Registration Services assigned over 5,648 network
     addresses and registered over 22,676 domains.  There was one top-
     level country domains registered during September: Vatican City
     State.

     As of September 14, 1995 the InterNIC Registry has initiated
     charging for domains within the categories of COM, NET, ORG, GOV,
     and EDU.  Policies and Procedures have been implemented and are
     currently available via anonymous FTP to rs.internic.net, and our

     webb site which is http://rs.internic.net.

     During the month of September, domain requests continue to average
     between 1,000 - 1,500+ for new submissions per day. Adjustments
     continue to be made in domain programs/processing.  Additional,
     staffing is being acquired to accommodate the growth in
     registration requests. At the close of September 1995, the domain
     processing queue had decreased from 7,000+ to 5,000+ new domain
     registrations.

     II.  Current Status

     During the month of September 1995, InterNIC Registration Services
     received communications as shown below.  The majority of the
     correspondence concerned the assignment and re-assignment of
     network numbers and the registration or change of domain names.

          E-mail     41,935    (hostmaster@internic.net)
          Postal/Fax    225    (primarily IP number requests)
          Phone      10,568

     The Registrations Services host computer supported a large volume
     of information retrieval requests during the month of September.

                     Connections   Retrievals
          Gopher      45,383          33,907

     INTERNIC DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES

     The transition of the net-happenings and Scout Report mailing
     lists to Registration Services was completed in early September.
     All current subscribers of the lists should have been moved
     automatically.

     We have completed a review of the X.500 entries that we maintain
     for other organizations.  In some cases, our contacts at those

     organizations have disappeared or become inaccessible.  If we
     cannot find a contact, we will have to remove the organizations
     from our directory.

     In September, information about the InterNIC home pages was
     included in material given to members of Congress by the Library
     of Congress.  The InterNIC was also listed as a prominent site in
     Eye Magic Media's "Home Page Builder (TM)" and was highlighted the
     Business Broadcast on network radio.

     A reminder - if you would like to help the Internet community find
     a resource that you offer, send mail to admin@ds.internic.net and
     we will send information about listing your resource in the
     Directory of Directories.  If you prefer, you can enter
     information about your resource in our WWW suggestion form.  The
     form can be reached through our Directory of Directories Web page

     US DOMAIN REGISTRY
     ==================

     The US Domain is only registering domain names providing two
     nameservers. We will longer register direct registrations in the
     form of non-IP hosts, (i.e, UUCP connections requiring MX records),
     or IP hosts requiring A records).  The only A record we will add to
     our zone file is a glue record for a delegation.

     Please contact a local service provider to provide your primary and
     or secondary name service.

     For further information about the US Domain, send a message to:
     US-DOMAIN@ISI.EDU, or see our WEB page:

MERIT/INTERNET ENGINEERING
--------------------------

     This report summarizes recent activities of Merit's Internet
     Engineering group on behalf of the Routing Arbiter (RA) service and
     other projects.

     Routing Arbiter services are now fully in production at the
     Ameritech Advanced Data Services (AADS), Washington, D.C. (MAE-

     East), and Sprint NAPs.  At each of these interconnection points,
     the RA's Route Servers-- Sun SPARC 20 workstations running a
     customized version of the GateD routing software--provide scalable,
     optimized routing services for the Internet community.  The RA also
     provides the Routing Arbiter Database, in which networks and
     providers enter data directly in order to publish:

       --The set of routes originated by an Autonomous System (AS)
       --The routing policies the AS implements towards other ASs,
         i.e., the routes it announces to and accepts from its
         neighbor ASs

     Routing policy in the Routing Arbiter Database is used to configure
     the Route Servers at the interconnection points, and can be used by
     an AS to configure its routers.  For more information about these
     services, see:

         http://www.ra.net/routing.arbiter/RA

     The RA service is now peering with the vBNS at all four NAPs:
     AADS, Washington, D.C., Sprint, and PacBell.  As two components of
     the new NSFNET architecture, the RA and vBNS project teams are
     working together to define how the RA service can support the vBNS.
     Other new peering sessions with the Route Servers were also
     established in September by WIS.COM at the Washington, D.C. and
     Sprint NAPs.  A complete list of BGP peering sessions is available
     from:

         http://www.ra.net/routing.arbiter/RA/.bgp.peers.html

     Several useful new tools are now available from the Routing Arbiter
     Project.  They are:

     IRRWeb
       A graphical interface into the Internet Routing Registry, IRRWeb
       makes it possible to use the Web to query the IRR and update RADB
       AS objects, Route objects, and Maintainer objects.  Users can enter
       any value that can be submitted through a whois query, such as an
       AS number, network IP address, or maintainer. IRRWeb then displays
       the corresponding AS objects, Route objects, or Maintainer objects
       from the various registries in the IRR.  Authorized maintainers can
       edit the objects directly; IRRWeb performs a cursory pre-check and
       mails the revised object to auto-dbm@ra.net, the automated RADB e-
       mail interface.  The user then receives e-mail from auto-dbm
       displaying the revised object, or explaining why the object was
       rejected.  To use IRRWeb, see:

           http://www.ra.net/cgi-bin/ra/query-radb.pl

     ROUTE FLAP REPORTING MECHANISM
       This new tool set generates daily reports of route flaps (link
       failures at regular and short intervals) throughout the Internet.
       Modeled after the reports originally produced by Curtis Villamizar
       of ANS, the new mechanism generates reports using tools provided in
       Merit's Multi-Threaded Routing Toolkit.  The data is obtained from
       peering sessions with Route Servers at the interconnection points.
       The reports note the last state of the route (up or down), the
       length of time that a route existed (or did not exist) for that
       prefix, and the number of times a route for the prefix transitioned
       from down to up, up to down, or was replaced by a new route with
       changed attribute information.  AS-path-specific information is
       also provided for every path announced for the prefix.  To view
       today's route flap reports, see:

           http://www.ra.net/routing.arbiter/RA/RADB.tools.docs/flap.html

     PGP-BASED RADB AUTHENTICATION
      Follow these steps to take advantage of the new RADB support for
      PGP-based digital signatures:

         1. Register your public key with the Routing Arbiter Service.
         2. Modify your Maintainer object to reflect your use of digital
            signatures.
         3. Use PGP to sign your RADB transactions.

      For detailed instructions, see:

           http://www.ra.net/routing.arbiter/RA/RADB.tools.docs/pgp.html

     Finally, the RA project has defined a "Routing Arbiter Database
     Service Agreement" that outlines the general operational policy
     followed by the Routing Arbiter in providing the RADB service, and
     provides guidelines for users of the RADB.  It is available from:

         http://www.ra.net/routing.arbiter/RA/radbserv.html

     Cornell University and Merit are pleased to announce that the
     GateDaemon Project and GateD Consortium have moved to Merit.  The
     GateD routing software, which is used worldwide, supports multiple
     IP and ISO network routing protocols.  GateD also provides a
     platform for prototyping and distributing new routing protocols and
     features, such as policy-based route filtering.  Membership in the
     GateD Consortium is open to all organizations.  Members participate
     in discussions of new GateD features, receive briefings about new
     capabilities, and have opportunities to work closely with the GateD

     Observed performance on the UK-US link is severely degraded.
     Speculation is that this is due to

     a) large numbers of very short lived TCP connections (e.g. HTTP
        usage of TCP from WWW accesses).

     b) so many simultaneous connections at any time, that the average
        bottleneck capacity available to each would at best be less than
        one MTU (MSS) per RTT.

     Desperate measures have been dreamt up, but it may prove less
     expesive to upgrade the US-UK link sooner, than to field new
     versions of TCP, new router congestion control schemes, and RSVP
     for WWW and Email.

     A succesful demonstration was carried out from Telecom95 with IP
     Mbone access over international ATM again being used to provide
     conferencing, including a link up to a demonstration that
     coincidently was being carried out at BT Labs.

The 21st RIPE Meeting

   The 21st RIPE Meeting was held in May 1995 in Rome, Italy
   Approximately 150 people attended.  Rob Blokzijl opended the meetings
   and requested input on additions/changes to the meeting agenda.
   Minutes of the last meeting were approvaed.

RIPE NCC Report - Daniel Karrenberg

   Daniel noted that the slides provided at this meeting are very
   similar to the last meeting three months ago.  He provided updates to
   them, which included the DNS hostcount, and the number of local
   registries.  The are 192 local registries as of May 4th.  This number
   is not quite doubling every nine months.  The registry function is
   recording 52 submissions per working day (32 at the last meeting in
   January).  He mentioned that the RIPE NCC staff does not have enough
   time to support the local Internet Registries (IRs).  The NCC mailbox
   is receiving 66 messages per working day (41 msgs at the last
   meeting).  Most are routine messages.  More than 50% of the NCC's
   tasks are routine duties.  A billing mechanism for the registry
   database is continuing.  A structure billing procedure/routing
   operation is in place.

   Staff burnout continues.  Roderik Muit is a full FTE.  Halice Kuey
   has been hired as a Junior Hostmaster, and will start in June.
   Daniel stated that 6 FTEs are not enough.  The Routing Registry and
   PRIDE tools maintenance should consume on additional FTE.  The NCC is
   still catching up.  The situation is improving, but very slowly.

   Goals for the RIPE NCC in the next few months include:

   - Streamline registry activities - ticketing started, automation.

   - Prepare to resume reporting - automatic statistics gathering,
     simplify report formatting.

   - Registry Training Project - An outline course has been produced.
     A course being developed.  Routing registry maintenance and an
     activity plan has been completed, but little is happening, so far.

      - Still under the umbrella of TERENA, investigations
        are continuing on the possibilities ofmoving out as
        a separate functioning entity

IPv6 -BOF - Daniel Karrenberg

   The IETF is working on IPv6 and RIPE may be interested in forming a
   working group to liase.  This BOF is being held to investigate RIPE
   participants' interest in this topic.  Geert-Jan reported on what
   IPv6 implementations he found that are running in Europe.  Francis
   Dupuy has been testing in France.  The first plan is to have routers,
   but there are also many concerns about routing.  Also, the problem is
   more serious than people imagine.

   Daniel stated that there are two platforms the RIPE community could
   test via the RIPE NCC.  PCs or Sparc1s.  Suns were chosen first.  The
   RIPE NCC will start address assignments.  They have asked the IANA
   and IAB in informal talks if this is a good idea.  The answer was
   yes.  The RIPE NCC will start doing this, and putting the information
   into the database.

   Daniel then asked if there was any other business or remarks?  Do we
   need to form a working group?  Who will chair?  One comment was that
   it is very important for the RIPE community to provide feedback of
   the European view to the IETF community.  Geert-Jan mentioned that
   there are major flaws in IPv6, but there is a need to start
   implementing it and share experiences.  It was decided to establish a
   working group.  The chair named to head up this working group is

The Joint European Networking Conference (JENC6)

   The Trans European Research and Education Network Association's
   (TERENA) Joint European Networking Conference (JENC6) was held in May
   1995 in Tel Aviv, Israel, with approximately 350 attendees.

Words of Welcome to JENC6

   Frode Greisen, President of TERENA opened this conference, and stated
   that there is a shared workstation environment focus.  He hopes the
   attendees find inspiration to create new applications for the future.
   Steve Druck (on behalf of the JENC program committee) provided a
   brief overview of how the conference's network is set up at the Dan
   Panorama Hotel.  There is a Fiberoptic net to Israel's Metropolitan
   Network via Telecom Switzerland with a 2MB line to Geneva. Yitzak
   Kaul from the Israel Telecom Corporation stated that this is the
   first JENC to take place outside of Europe.  Israel is honored TERENA
   picked it for its first public event since the convergence of RARE
   and EARN.  Best wishes for a good conference.

Walter DeBaker - Keynote Speaker, "Europe's Way to the Information
Society and a Global Information Infrastructure"

   Society has been interested in this topic before these terms became
   popular.  Policy Development = Politicians.  For example, the Treaty
   of Maastricht 1992, the Clinton-Gore NII/GII White Paper, and the
   eight G7 Principles:

      - dynamic competition
      - private investments
      - an adaptable regulator framework
      - open access to networks with universal provisions
      - access to services
      - equality of opportunity to the citizen
      - diversity of content: cultural and linguistic,
      - world-wide cooperation: less developed countries

   information = application + content

   Operators supply:

   1) services, transport data (network of networks)
   2) layer of applications,
   3) specific application - medical, etc.,

   There should be support for this diversity.  Support of this is of
   European interest.

   New Market Structure

      Open systems and convergence of multiple technologies.  Think
      about a new head division of a market structure.  Building the
      components must be included in a world wide market with many
      options.

   Re-engineering Human Activity

      Local and world wide communication for citizens and businesses
      with instant access to access to information, when and where it is
      needed.  One should not try to reinvent the wheel.  New types need
      to be developed.  For example: tele-banking, conferencing,
      working, shopping, marketing, infotainment, etc.  We all must work
      together.  Who are the actors and what are their new roles?
      Potential new roles include: information users, operators,
      information producers, component and system producers.

   Information Society Forum

      Creation of this forum for users, social groups, network
      operators, content and services providers, equipment
      manufacturers, and institutions.  This forum will have 100-150
      members, who willn start in July.  They will elect a steering
      group.

What are the problems?

   There are three converging universes - switching (telephone),
   broadcasting (radio and TV), routing (computing).  All three types
   are changing and they will eventually converge.  An information
   infrastructure is already there, but it is not a single entity.
   There are three.

   Also, there are barriers in the development, besides three different
   universes.  For example, monopolies (employment), market
   fragmentation, vertical integration, critical mass, slow
   standardization, past investments, and lack of awareness and urgency
   in these matters.

   Action Plan (July 1994 - Bangerman Report) - Regulatory and legal
   framework networks, basic services, etc.  Annexes - possible
   partnerships pending measure, new measures to consider.  G7 summit -
   lots of things to ponder.

   Search for new ideas -

           awareness (problems and opportunities)
           partnership (cooperation with competition)
           new business practices (services)
           research (applications)
           regulation (public service obligation)
           a new standardization process

   There is also a new wave in research on the applications side.  What
   about regulation?  Public service obligations will come from private
   companies in competition (interconnection and interoperability), open
   access to networks and services (no discrimination, etc.).

   The major problems are not technical, economical or managerial, but
   how can we safeguard public interest in a free information market?
   JENC participants must take on this challenge and be pioneers in this
   endeavor.

Peter Jung - SURFNET Internet via ISDN

   The ISDN network:

      1) Basic Rate access (2-64K synchronous connection and primary rate
         access (30*64K) synchronous connection.

      2) For data and voice.

      3) Cost comparable to PSTN (in the Netherlands).

      4) Additional services: calling line identification, presentation,
         multisubscriber numbering, etc.

      5) Problems: equipment (especially for Internet over ISDN).

   Surfnet ISDN Access (SURF-it)

      1) ISDN dial-in services for individual users.
      2) ISDN dial-in services for small LANs.
      3) ISDN for overload and backup for leased lines.

   Conditions:

      -based on STDs as much as possible
      -no async communication over ISDN
      -large scale solutions
      -no calls from the Internet to the users

   Preliminary Pilots

      BRA (Basic Rate Access) dial-in services for LAN access/BRA dial-
      in services for PC acccess.  There were some problems.

   Test results:

      1) no ISDN access from internet to LAN; consequently, nameserver
         off-site/PCP mailservers offsite

      2) call set up time - 10 seconds

      3) costs - three hours user on working days = leased lines, hence less
         than 10 users

      4) security: of costs: timers, of access: CHAP

   LAN access further developments:

      1) name and mail server onsite
      2) bonding on PPP link for 128K access
      3) add CLIP for security
      4) PRA (Primary Rate Access) dial-in facility

   PC access side (access results - no service, yet)

      -MS windows work
      -Unix workstations work
      -Macintosh only one board with PPP driver - still problems
       (one PPP driver = 1000 ECU - expensive!)
      -Security - use timers and CHAP again
      -PKG - for MS windows (and other?) users

      Current Status - PC access.  See if they can get PRA points. PRA
      access router used.  Spider multiple BRA access router used.  CLIP
      can be used.  pkg for windows being developed.

   Access for LANS

      -multiple BRA router
      -CLIP can be tested
      -on site mail and name server to be tested

      Backup and overload: some test have been completed, but not yet
      satisfactory results.

   Future:

      Uniform, large scale peering based access points, higher bandwidth
      - multiple 64K channels, ISDN service for backup and overload.
      Value added services - (expertise, user support, training
      materials, packaging

   Framework Policy.

   Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)

   Telematics for Knowledge Program (1994-1998)

   - Validation of European research interconnection
   - Validation of telematics for life long learning
   - Remote access to library sources
   - Following a user driven approach for research and development
   - "Telematics for Research"

   Actions involved:

   1) national funding and policy bodies
   2) National network for research
   3) users
   4) telematics industry as provide
   5) public and private network operators

   Priorities - improve trans European networking infrastructure to
   support 34/mgbits.

   Planning to upgrade to 156 mbits, with full European coverage (phased
   roll out, intercontinental links).

   The telematics for research as a program looks interesting, but it is
   still too early to comment.

   What are the implications for intellectual property on the Internet?

   Distribution: ramifications of a technology like the Internet in
   distribution of publications where, "our packets cross borders freely
   and our sense of community should be equally open."

   Internet = global in scope, with no physical boundaries

   The Internet possesses the ability to make everyone a publisher.
