     RESOURCE DISCOVERY AND DIRECTORY SERVICE
     ----------------------------------------

        The Internet Research Task Force on Resource Discovery is
        continuing its experimental efforts with the Harvest system
        (http://harvest.cs.colorado.edu/).  We are moving Harvest
        increasingly towards an interoperation architecture for network
        search systems, by working with commercial search & retrieval
        engine vendors to (a) integrate their engines, and (b) define
        promising future research problems related to this integration
        effort.  We are also working on support for distributed
        searching, repluggable object storage managers, local post-
        processing of query results, and deployment of an experimental
        national caching infrastructure.

     1. The summer IETF meeting was held in Stockholm, Sweden the week
        of July 17-21, 1995. The meeting was very well attended,
        approximately 20% higher than the attendence level in Amsterdam,
        the first IETF meeting.

        The IETF will be meeting in Dallas, Texas on December 4-8, 1995.
        Our local host for this meeting is MCI. At this time, two
        meetings have been tentatively scheduled for 1996: March 4-8 in
        Los Angelas, California followed by a meeting in Montreal,
        Canada which is scheduled for June 24-28, 1996. Once all the
        arrangements have been made, notifications will be sent to the

     REGISTRATION SERVICES

     I.  Significant Events

     InterNIC Registration Services assigned over 6,914 network
     addresses and registered over 12,190 domains.  There were four (4)
     top-level country domains registered during June: Madagascar (MG),



Cooper                                                         [Page 12]

Internet Monthly Report                                        July 1995


     Kyrgyzstan (KG), Tanzania (TZ), and Samoa (WS).

     The suit that Knowledgenet has filed against Network Solutions and
     David L. Boone over the knowledgenet.com domain has been dismissed.
     David Boone has agreed to relinquish the domain name to
     Knowledgenet, Inc.

     During the month of July, domain requests are averaging between
     700- 800+ for new submissions per day. Adjustments continue to be
     made in domain processing.  Additional, staffing is being acquired
     to accommodate the growth in registration requests. At the close of
     July 1995, the domain processing queue had again increased from
     6,000 to 15,000+ new domain registrations.

     Mark Kosters, Debbie Fuller and Dave Graves attended the Quarterly
     Review of InterNIC Registration Services (Network Solutions) and
     Directory Services (AT&T) at the National Science Foundation in
     Arlington, VA.  Susan Calcari who has relocated to the University
     of Wisconsin and resumed the weekly production and distribution of
     the Scout Report also presented.

     Mark Kosters, Stan Borinski and Kim Hubbard attended the IETF
     meeting in Stockholm July 16-21, 1995.  They presented the
     RFC1466BIS draft.  Parts of the draft were accepted.  Additional
     work is required for portability of address space and assignment
     criteria.

     The computer equipment which was ordered for the Info Scout and the
     Assistant Scout has been delivered.  Susan Calcari assisted NSI in
     the NIC Liaison recruitment process in which a candidate has been
     selected and will start working soon at NSI.


     II.  Current Status

     During the month of July 1995, InterNIC Registration Services
     received communications as shown below.  The majority of the
     correspondence concerned the assignment and re-assignment of
     network numbers and the registration or change of domain names.

          E-mail     27,278    (hostmaster@internic.net)
          Postal/Fax    277    (primarily IP number requests)
          Phone       4,959

     The Registrations Services host computer supported a large volume
     of information retrieval requests during the month of June.

     INTERNIC DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES

     We made a number of improvements to our Web services during July.
     We have supported Web access to the X.500 directory for some time,
     but we recently improved the interface.  The former system used a
     Gopher to X.500 gateway to support Web access.  It has been
     replaced with a direct Web to X.500 gateway.  The Gopher to X.500
     interface remains available for Gopher users.

     We have also installed a Web based form to allow users to enter
     information about a resource they feel should be included in our
     Directory of Directories.  A resource owner may also use the form
     to tell us about their resource.

     Take a look at our Web pages starting at:

              http://ds.internic.net

     A reminder - if you would like to help the Internet community find a
     resource that you offer, send mail to admin@ds.internic.net and we
     will send information about listing your resource in the Directory of
     Directories.  If you prefer, you can enter information about your
     resource in our WWW suggestion form.  The form can be reached through
     our Directory of Directories Web page at:

     ROUTING ARBITER SERVICES

     Routing Arbiter services are now fully operational at the Sprint
     NAP.  Located in Pennsauken NJ, the facility comprises an FDDI LAN
     that supports both shared and dedicated bandwidth with DEC
     GIGASwitch-based crossbar switching.  The RA Web pages provide
     information for providers who are interested in establishing a
     peering session with the Sprint Route Server:

         http://www.ra.net/routing.arbiter/RA/.how.to.peer.html

     The status of BGP peering sessions at all the connection points is
     shown in the following table:

     Brian Renaud is working with staff at CA*net to coordinate the task
     of identifying--and deleting--RADB references to routes belonging
     to the CA Autonomous System.  This effort is one of several ongoing
     projects that will help eliminate duplicate registrations in the
     Internet Routing Registry.

     CISCO QUERY TOOL

     Internet Routing Registry (IRR) users have long recognized the need
     for tools that check the IRR against routes actually propagated in
     the Internet.  A tool is now available from Merit that obtains and
     analyzes routing information from production Ciscos, and compares
     the data with routes in the Routing Arbiter Database and other
     registries in the IRR.  Called CiscoBGP, the software also flags
     prefixes that are reserved by RFC1597.  An alpha version is
     available from:

         ftp://ftp.ra.net/routing.arbiter/RADB/tools/cisco.01.tar.Z

     Two scripts are provided with CiscoBGP.  Cisco_fetch takes the
     Cisco's IP address and password as input, automatically sets up a
     telnet session to the router, issues a 'show ip bgp' command, and
     dumps the BGP routing tables to a file on the local workstation.
     Usage is as follows:

         cisco_fetch hostname password enable_password

     The cisco_check script then processes the 'show ip bgp' output and
     lists prefixes with AS origins different than those registered in
     the IRR.  Usage is as follows:

         cisco_check inputfile

     If the origin AS differs from the origin registered in the

     OTHER ACTIVITIES

     Jessica Yu attended an AADS NAP peering meeting this month.  Among
     the topics discussed were transit agreements among NAP customers
     and the status of the NAP's Multi-Lateral Peering Agreement (MLPA),
     which was developed jointly by Yu and the AADS NAP staff.

     Brian Renaud, Craig Labovitz, Sue Hares, and Elise Gerich attended
     the 33rd IETF in Stockholm during the week of July 17.  Labovitz
     collaborated with Cengiz Alaettinoglu in presenting the "Routing
     Policy Specification Language Dictionary" at the Routing Policy
     System (RPS) Working Group meetings.  At the IEPG meeting, Gerich
     gave a presentation on issues relating to the reliability of data
     in the RADB, and discussed the actions Merit plans to take in order
     to ensure consistency of data in the RADB with other registries in
     the Internet Routing Registry.

UCL
----

     Mark Handley attended the Stockholm IETF, and co-chaired the MMUSIC
     WG with Ruth Lang and Eve Schooler, as well as attending numerous
     other WGs including int-serv and rsvp. We also helped coordinate
     the use of the Pan-European PNO ATM Network (PNO = Public Network
     Operator, which is a newer term for telco or PTT. ATM=Asynchronous
     Transfer Mode, which is a new term for X.25:-)

     Tony Ballardie helped run a useful IDMR WG session.

     The Terena working group on IP and the MICE project coordinated the
     use of the 34Mbps cross connected ATM trial to carry the mbone to
     many countries around Europe. There were somne outages (and due to
     best effort only support for the switch infrastructure, MTTR was a
     little high) but the access to higher bandwidth meant that many
     more people were able to join in and actually appreciate the
     technology, and the value of the IETF.

     Various US collaborators in the areas of resource reservation and
     multicast passed through UCL o ntheir way back home. Some work on
     policy based multicast routing may be forthcoming.
