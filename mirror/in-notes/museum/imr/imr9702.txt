INTERNET MONTHLY REPORTS
------------------------

The purpose of these reports is to communicate to the Internet Research
Group the accomplishments, milestones reached, or problems discovered by
the participating organizations.

Each organization is expected to submit a 1/2 page report on the first
business day of the month describing the previous month's activities.
These reports should be submitted via network mail to "IMR-ED@ISI.EDU".

The Internet Monthly Report mailing list is now managed by MajorDomo at
ISI.EDU.  The announcements of new issues on the Internet Monthly Report
are sent to the IETF-Announce list and to this IMR list.

Requests to be ADDED or DELETED from the Internet Monthly report list
should be sent to "majordomo@isi.edu" with the message body either
"subscribe imr" or "unsubscribe imr".

Details on obtaining the current IMR, or back issues, via FTP or EMAIL
may be obtained by sending an EMAIL message to "rfc-info@ISI.EDU" with
the message body "help: ways_to_get_imrs".  For example:

        To: rfc-info@ISI.EDU
        Subject: getting imrs

  1. The first meeting of the year will be held in Memphis, Tennessee
     from April 7-10, 1997. Our local host will be Federal Express.

     to the IETF Announcement list. Remember that information on
     future meetng sites can always be found in the file
     0mtg-sites.txt, located on the IETF shadow directories. Of
     course, this information is provided on the Web. The IETF's URL
     is:

     INTERNIC DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES

     We recently built a new search engine which is in service on our
     production machines.  WebFinder is designed to help users who are
     looking for a particular organization on the web.  It looks for
     the organization's web servers rather than specific web pages.  It
     uses the same seed database that we maintain for Netfind.

     To try WebFinder, look at:

         http://ds.internic.net/ds/webfinder/WebFinder.html

     In early February one of our servers (ds2.internic.net) was moved
     from Columbus, Ohio to Middletown, Virginia.  The machine is back
     up and running with the same name and services but a new IP
     address.

     THE US DOMAIN REGISTRY
     ----------------------

     The US Domain has an online registration form available at
     http://www.isi.edu/us-domain.

     The US Domain administrator no longer makes direct registrations of
     hosts, and only makes delegations of third or fourth level domain
     names (such as localities).

     Some of the processing of the requests to the third level domain
     name is now automated. In particular, most requests to register
     names in localities already delegated are automatically forwarded
     to the administrator of that locality.

     The policy regarding the charges for the domain name passed on
     during delegation is that the administrator of the locality has to
     notify one year in advance before charging for those domains.

MERIT INTERNET ENGINEERING
--------------------------

     This report summarizes February 1997 activities of Merit's Internet
     Engineering group on behalf of the Routing Arbiter (RA) service and
     other projects.

     Merit is seeking beta testers for Trawhoisd (Trivial rawhoisd), the
     distributed version of the Routing Arbiter Database whois server.
     Trawhoisd allows users to cache any or all of the databases in the
     Internet Routing Registry on local workstations, giving users
     complete, local administrative control of their own registry. Users
     can select a subset of the registries to be locally cached--only AS
     objects, Route objects, or Maintainer objects, for example.  This
     kind of flexibility brings considerable savings in cache storage
     requirements--a major concern for users maintaining their own
     copies of the IRR.   The streamlined Trawhoisd code is easy to
     install, and runs under SunOS, Solaris, and Digital Unix.  If you
     would like to test the new code, please send e-mail to db-
     admin@radb.ra.net.

     Route Server Next Generation (RSng) operations are now up and
     running at the Digital Internet Exchange, Digital's exchange point
     in Palo Alto CA.  Two DEC Alphas running Digital Unix are in
     production at the site. RSng services went into production at the
     MAE-East interconnection point in January. By taking over the task
     of processing routing updates for ISP routers, the Route Servers
     eliminate the need to establish separate peering sessions with
     other routers at each exchange point.  The Route Servers boost
     throughput for ISP routers and allow faster delivery of customers'
     data through the Internet.

Internet Monthly Report                                    February 1997


     The Route Servers were developed under the NSF-supported Routing
     Arbiter project, a partnership between Merit and the USC
     Information Sciences Institute.  RSng, a commercial follow-on
     activity, makes it possible for exchange point operators to
     purchase Route Server services from Merit.

     For more information, see:

         http://www.rsng.net

     Intensive IPv6 development work continues for Merit's Multi-
     Threaded Routing Toolkit (MRT).  MRT now provides IPv6 supports
     for:

       - Solaris IPv6 Release 5 (Solaris 2.5 and 2.5.1)
       - Linux IPv6 (2.1.24 and later)
       - INRIA IPv6 (FreeBSD 2.1 and 2.1.5)

     Non-IPv6-compliant versions of MRT run under:
       - Solaris 2.5 and 2.5.1
       - SunOS 4.1.3 and 4.1.4
       - Linux 2.0 and later
       - FreeBSD 2.1 and 2.1.5
       - NetBSD 1.1 and 1.2

     MRT's RIPng implementation now interoperates with DEC, Cisco, and
     Bay Networks routers over the 6bone.  In addition, MRT's BGP
     implementation has been extended to support the COMMUNITIES
     attribute.  The current MRT development platforms are a four-
     processor SPARCstation 20 running Solaris IPv6 Release 5 on Solaris
     2.5.1 with POSIX threads support, and Intel Pentium Pro and 486DX
     systems running INRIA IPv6 on FreeBSD 2.1.5 and Linux IPv6 2.1.24.

     MRT developers Craig Labovitz and Masaki Hirabaru would like to
     thank their colleagues in Japan, Portugal, the Netherlands, the UK,
     and the US for their many contributions, including bug fixes,
     patches, and Unix ports.  For more information about MRT, see:

Internet Monthly Report                                    February 1997


     The Requests for Comments (RFCs) are a series of notes, started in
     1969, about the Internet (originally the ARPANET). The notes
     discuss many aspects of computing and computer communication
     focusing in networking protocols, procedures, programs, and
     concepts, but also including meeting notes, opinion, and sometimes
     humor. The specification documents of the Internet protocol suite,
     as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and its
     steering group (the IESG), are published as RFCs.

     RFCs-to-be are edited by the RFC Editor.  RFCs enter the RFC
     Editor's work queue either by an action of the IESG or by
     independent submission.  Most independent submissions are referred
     to the IESG to check for overlap with IETF work.  The IESG might
     put a hold on a document to gather more input from its members.
     The wait for an RFC to be published varies as there can be
     unforeseen complications (typically editorial matters that need
     clarification from the author).  Documents can be removed from the
     publication queue if they are found to be insufficient or incorrect
     or if the IESG asks the author to join work already in progress in
     the IETF.
