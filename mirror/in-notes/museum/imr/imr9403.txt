     1. By the time the March IMR is distributed, the 29th meeting of
        the IETF will have concluded. The meeting was held from March
        29 through April 1 in Seattle, Washington, and was hosted by
        NorthWestNet and the University of Washington.

        The next meeting of the IETF will be held in Toronto, Canada.

INTERNET PROJECTS
-----------------

ANSNET/NSFNET BACKBONE ENGINEERING
----------------------------------

     Network Status Summary
     ======================

     ANSnet total packet traffic grew by over 15% in March '94.  The
     process of CIDR aggregation began in March with the announcement of
     aggregates and the withdrawal of some class- based routes.

     March Backbone Traffic Statistics
     =================================

     The total inbound packet count for the ANSnet (measured using SNMP
     interface counters) was 56,860,946,144 on T3 ENSS interfaces, up
     16.2% from February.  The total packet count into the network
     including all ENSS serial interfaces was 64,893,607,689 up 15.4%
     from February.

     Router Forwarding Table Statistics
     ==================================

     The maximum number of destinations announced to the ANSnet during
     March was 19,388 up 9.46% from February.  The number of network
     destinations configured for announcement to the ANSnet but were
     never announced (silent nets) during March was 7,395.


     BGP4/CIDR Deployment Status
     ===========================

     Since the deployment of BGP4/CIDR on ANSnet in February, we have
     installed BGP4 software on the ANSnet/CIX interconnection. The
     following autonomous systems are currently passing routing
     information with ANSnet via BGP4:

     As of early April '94, we have removed 489 class based destinations
     that are now represented by 93 configured aggregates.  Among these
     93 configured aggregates:

          78 of these are top-level aggregates (not nested in
          another aggregate).

          52 of these are actively announced to ANSnet.

          48 of these have at least one subnet configured.

          20 of these have resulted in the withdrawal of at least
          one configured more specific route.

          12 of these have resulted in the withdrawal of 50% of
          their configured more specific routes.

Internet Monthly Report                                       March 1994


          11 of these have resulted in the withdrawal of most
          (80%+) of their more specific routes.

     This results in the withdrawal of 489 class-based destination
     announcements from ANSnet.  For further details on these CIDR
     aggregates, see merit.edu:pub/nsfnet/cidr/nestings.announced for
     full listings.

     There are two CIDR problems that were identified in February.  The
     first problem involved a radix trie bug in the router AIX kernel
     that affects overlapping routes (three or more routes with the same
     prefix but different address).  A fix to the AIX kernel will be
     deployed in early April to address this problem.  The second
     problem involves gated getting a route with a duplicate AS that
     shows up in the AS- path twice.  This has happened twice, and the
     problem has been temporarily addressed by filtering the route at
     the source AS.  The problem occurs when gated incorrectly attempts
     to redistribute this AS-path to BGP3 peers (this is ok for BGP4).
     This problem will be fixed in a new gated that will be deployed in
     April.

     Other gated software changes will be deployed over the next couple
     of months to improve policy processing (required to support some
     advanced forms of proxy aggregation).


     Routing Stability Measured on the T3 Network
     ============================================

     The three different routing stability measurements that have been
     reported on over the past year were based on rcp_routed log file
     entries.  Gated software was deployed at the end of February to
     replace rcp_routed.  These routing stability reports have not yet
     been converted to use gated logging.  No data is available for the
     month of March.  Data collection is expected to resume in April.


     Notable Outages in March '94
     ============================

     E135 (San Diego) suffered an extended fiber outage on 03/04

     E134 (Boston) was unreachable via T3 on 03/05 due to DSU problems.

     E140 (Lincoln) and E129 (Champaign) were unreachable via T3 on
     03/10 due to software config problems.

     Xlink suffered extended circuit outages on 03/16 and 03/21.

     Scalability
     ===========

     Under its Defense Simulation Internet (DSI) Engineering contract
     from ARPA (ASTO), BBN is tasked to study the issue of "scalability"
     from the perspective of network performance and functionality.  The
     Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) user community has
     ambitious goals for dramatically increasing the scale of simulated
     war-fighting exercises.  While the largest exercises to date have
     involved less than 1000 "entities" (tanks, planes, ships, etc.),
     planned future exercises may involve as many as 100,000.  Moreover,
     the average size of updates exchanged among simulated entities has
     grown with the development of the DIS messaging standard.  With a
     growing variety of simulators, inclusion of live participants
     operating in instrumented test ranges, and increasing emphasis on
     simulation fidelity, latency requirements are becoming more
     stringent.  Within the next two-three years, cost constraints will
     likely preclude solving these problems by two-order-of-magnitude
     increases in network bandwidth.  Instead, it is more likely that
     changes to both the DIS applications and the technology of
     supporting network(s) will be necessary.

     During March, BBN completed statistical analysis in support of a
     characterization of DIS traffic and began the design of experiments
     needed to measure baseline performance of the current DSI.  The
     performance baseline will be used both to determine the maximum
     scope of exercises supportable today and as a basis for evaluation
     of future enhancements to the technology of the DSI.  In other
     work, BBN completed the "Scalability Network Simulator," a flow-
     level network simulation tool capable of modeling dynamic multi-
     cast membership.  It is now equipped with a GUI that facilitates
     topology editing, configuration of device parameters, and
     specification of statistics to be displayed and/or logged.

     Using a recently completed tool that parses simulation updates of
     both the Simnet protocol and the DIS protocol (an IEEE standard),

Internet Monthly Report                                       March 1994


     we analyzed two large samples of traffic collected during demos at
     last November's I/ITSEC in Orlando.  We obtained average and peak
     per-entity update generation frequencies, simulation packet size
     distributions, and distributions of simulation packets by type.
     Eventually, after more data collection and analysis, we expect to
     be able to use the resultant traffic characterization as an aid in
     predicting, for a specified exercise scenario, required network
     capacity.  This will require correlating observed traffic phenomena
     with degree of engagement and events on the virtual battlefield.
     The results of analysis completed so far were presented at the 10th
     Workshop for DIS, 14-18 March, and will be published in the
     proceedings of this meeting.

     BBN is working in close cooperation with representatives of NRaD
     and IDA to characterize current and near-term DSI performance in
     preparation for the STOW-Europe exercise scheduled for the Fall.
     It is necessary to determine how big an exercise can be supported,
     and we are now designing experiments to be staged both in the lab
     and on the operational DSI to determine throughput and latency
     characteristics of end-to-end paths.  In the process, bottlenecks
     will be identified, and this information will be used to prioritize
     near-term enhancement efforts.

     The Scalability Network Simulator (Net Sim) was released for alpha
     testing to both MIT Lincoln Lab and NRaD.  The Net Sim is being
     ported (from a SPARC-based version) to an SGI for subsequent
     distribution to a larger number of users.

     Due to the rise in printing costs and other technical difficulties,
     the 6-page fold-out map of U.S. Internet Connectivity sites in its
     present form will no longer be part of the newsletter. In the past,
     regional and midlevel networks contributed statistics on the number
     and identity of their connections and customers, as well as the
     number of dialup customers for inclusion in the Map.  We appreciate
     all of the NICs and service providers who contacted us with
     statistics for inclusion in the Map and sincerely apologize for any
     inconvenience it may have caused.

     Beginning with the March/April 1994 issue, the _NSF Network News_
     will feature a variety of maps from different sources which are
     better able to chronicle the growth of the NSFNET and Internet
     community.

     GIGABIT NETWORKING

     Infrastructure

     Deborah Estrin, Jon Postel, Bob Braden, Steve Casner, Eve Schooler,
     Ann Cooper, Joyce Reynolds attended the 29th IETF meetings in
     Seattle, Washington, March 27 - April 1, 1994.

     Bob Felderman was invited to talk at the University of Toronto,
     March 18-23, 1994. Paul Mockapetris participated at the ARPA HPCC
     Conference in Alexandria, Virginia, March 14-18, 1994.

     Netstation
     ----------

     A series of experiments were undertaken, using the prototype
     hardware environment of the ATOMIC network to determine limits of
     remote procedure call (RPC) performance.  High levels of
     performance were achieved by combining a number of techniques:

           User process mapping of network interface memory
           Application Layer Framing [Tennenhouse and Clark]
           Packet Stenciling
           Rewriting the Mosaic packet processing program

     The ATOMIC network interface buffers are partitioned between
     dedicated user processes and the standard BSD UNIX protocol stack.
     This allows selected user processes exclusive access to their own
     network buffers and to directly frame their own packets.

     We plan that all Netstation traffic will take place via RPCs, thus
     an RPC stencil is the only one needed.  An minimal-length Sun
     Microsystems compliant RPC stencil in ATOMIC is 96 bytes long.
     This header data is composed of 10 bytes of ATOMIC, 20 bytes IP, 8
     bytes of UDP, and 48 bytes of RPC information.

     The task of sending successive RPC messages for the user process
     consists of changing only those locations in the stencil that are

Internet Monthly Report                                       March 1994


     altered from call to call.  These are:

             (1) Destination addresses, in LAN and IP headers
             (2) Source and destination UDP ports in the UDP header
             (3) Packet lengths, in LAN and IP headers
             (4) Checksums, in LAN and IP header
             (5) Procedure and program indexes, in the RPC header
                 and finally,
             (6) Supply procedure arguments at the end of the stencil

     We have timed the updating by a UNIX user process of stencils
     located in the ATOMIC network interface's shared buffer memory.  In
     terms of raw packet count, the results for a SPARCstation-10 were 9
     usec/pkt, or 111,000 packets per second.

     A more practical measure includes the delays to service the packets
     in the network interface and to transmit them.  This test sent
     40,000 packets per second from the user process out over the ATOMIC
     network.

     Bruce Parham, an EE formerly with Jet Propulsion Laboratory, was
     hired to design the display and camera network virtual devices.

     PC-ATOMIC
     ---------

     We are in the implementation phase of 486-based VL-Bus ATOMIC
     interface.  These boards are being built for part a project at
     University of Washington to support ATOMIC drivers for Mach. The
     interface includes programmed I/O access to LANai memory, and DMA
     and IP checksum hardware.

     We have been actively examining various design alternatives for the
     VL-Bus ATOMIC interface card. We have rejected the use of custom
     VLSI and gate-level PLAs, and will use three macrocell-level PALs
     for controlling the following components.

             - VL-Bus and board control.
             - DMA transfers to/from the board.
                     - Either host or LANai can control DMA.
             - IP checksum support in hardware.

     The board is designed to support programmed I/O and DMA, and to
     support DMA-completion interrupts in either direction.  The DMA and
     IP checksum control can be accessed by either the LANai or the VL-
     bus CPU.

Internet Monthly Report                                       March 1994


     We have also ported a memory-mapped device driver for the board to
     the NetBSD operating system to facilitate board verification at
     ISI. This driver allows user-level code to completely verify
     correct board operation. Design and implementation of the test code
     is also well underway.

     MULTIMEDIA CONFERENCING

     During the MMusic WG meetings at the Seattle IETF, there appeared
     to be a convergence of ideas about the general framework and
     protocols required for session control in the Internet, and a
     readiness to take steps toward interoperability of existing
     applications.  The group identified at least two services that we
     as system builders might need and use; CCCP, a bus-based protocol
     that could provide an API-level messaging abstraction, and the
     agreement algorithm on which a session service could be built.  In
     addition, there was interest in trying to understand, in the
     present context of the Internet/MBone/WWW, what constitutes a
     session and what are the functions that can be performed on
     sessions once they exist.  Thus, a variety of session rendez-vous
     mechanisms were described.  A final discussion focused on the

Internet Monthly Report                                       March 1994


     relevance of reliable multicast to a membership management
     protocol.  From formal and informal conversations with working
     group participants, it was clear that these ideas are ready to be
     codified and written down.

     Eve Schooler's talk, "Evolution of MMCC: Session Control
     Revisited", focused on the architectural framework behind the ISI
     session orchestration tool, mmcc, and discussed the ongoing
     evolution of its session control protocol.  The main goals of the
     discussion were to identify similarities and differences among the
     various session control approaches, and to suggest a synthesis of
     ideas.  Several issues were raised: the tradeoffs between a classic
     packet format and string-based messaging, how to characterize media
     agents, QoS, and session policies as part of a session description,
     the movement toward an adapative soft-state approach (periodic
     refresh), building a group consensus service on top of unreliable
     transport, options for cross-module communication, and finally
     incorporating multicast.

MERIT/NSFNET ENGINEERING
------------------------

     This report contains a summary of recent activities of Merit's
     Internet Engineering Group. We continue development of the Policy
     Routing Database system's capability to represent the NSFNET/ANS
     backbone configuration and support deployment of the CIDR and BGP-4
     routing architecture and implementation of a "CIDR Aggregate
     Registry"(described in RFC 1482), for registration of aggregated
     routing information between providers.

     The Policy Routing Database has been enhanced to support CIDR
     aggregate announcements for all peers of AS690 (the NSF/ANSnet
     backbone). Further, for CIDR-incapable midlevels (routers not
     running BGP4), we can create classless net announcements. Until the
     NACR is revised to include a field for proxy aggregation we ask
     that you include a statement with the NACR making the request.
     Since beginning CIDR aggregate announcements several midlevels have
     successfully withdrawn specific network announcements that are now
     included in an aggregate.  This is in keeping with the
     recommendation of the CIDRD (BGPD) working group and is encouraged
     in order to reduce the total number of network announcements.

     The merit server, prdb.merit.edu will show CIDR aggregate listings.
     Using the command: "whois -h prdb.merit.edu listaggs" will return
     the Prefix/Length, Netname, Date Announced, and Metric/AS listing
     for NSFNET announced aggregates.  Gated configuration files are

     /nsfnet/backbone.configuration and have the name format
     gated.nss##.t3p where ## is the nss number.

     The Offnet data collector has been modified to work with gated
     dumps and enhanced to monitor silent nets (including monitoring
     specific net withdrawn as part of CIDR aggregation). The offnet
     data and summary graphics (postscript) will be available for
     anonymous ftp from merit.edu in pub/nsfnet/offnet.

     Merit has begun a joint study with BellCore and PacBell on Route
     Server technology and routing in ATM-based NAP testbeds. We are
     evaluating routing strategies for multi-media NAPs, exploring the
     interaction between layers 2 and 3, and resolving general network
     management concerns.

             Vancouver School District       Vancouver, WA

     While bringing new K-12 members onto the Internet, NorthWestNet was
     also very active in supporting the efforts of a highly-respected
     Internet engineering group. The 29th Internet Engineering Task
     Force (IETF) was co-hosted by NorthWestNet and the University of
     Washington from March 28th through April 1st.  Attendance records

     were broken with approximately 750 computer scientists, network
     engineers, and information specialists from around the globe
     attending.

     The IETF has the primary responsibility for the development,
     review, and revision of the Internet standards that allow the
     exchange of information worldwide.  Besides the development of
     standards, participants also discussed network engineering and
     operations, user services, and changes to the network
     infrastructure that would ensure that both new and existing
     applications function effectively on today's and tomorrow's
     Internet.

     The Internet-connected terminal room designed and implemented by
     NorthWestNet and the University of Washington with support from
     Cisco Systems, NCD, Sun, and USWest Communications, offered 10mpbs
     service from the Ethernet LAN to the Internet and T1 connectivity
     for the MBONE Ethernet. Eighty Internet-connected stations were
     available to the attendees 24-hours a day throughout the
     conference.

     While the IETF was a big event for NorthWestNet, the regular
     business continued as well. As usual, the NorthWestNet User
     Services Committee met by teleconference. The topic was "Planning
     for User Services" and focused on short-term and long-term planning
     for Internet support.  Dan Revel, Systems Manager from Oregon
     Graduate Institute prepared the discussion outline while Keiko
     Pitter, Director of Academic Computing at Willamette University and
     chair of the NorthWestNet User Services Committee, moderated.
