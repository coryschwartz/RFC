INTERNET MONTHLY REPORTS
------------------------

The purpose of these reports is to communicate to the Internet Research
Group the accomplishments, milestones reached, or problems discovered by
the participating organizations.

Each organization is expected to submit a 1/2 page report on the first
business day of the month describing the previous month's activities.
These reports should be submitted via network mail to "IMR-ED@ISI.EDU".

The Internet Monthly Report mailing list is now managed by MajorDomo at
ISI.EDU.  The announcements of new issues on the Internet Monthly Report
are sent to the IETF-Announce list and to this IMR list.

Requests to be ADDED or DELETED from the Internet Monthly report list
should be sent to "majordomo@isi.edu" with the message body either
"subscribe imr" or "unsubscribe imr".

Details on obtaining the current IMR, or back issues, via FTP or EMAIL
may be obtained by sending an EMAIL message to "rfc-info@ISI.EDU" with
the message body "help: ways_to_get_imrs".  For example:

        To: rfc-info@ISI.EDU
        Subject: getting imrs

     INTERNIC DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES

     As planned, we moved our primary server to a new location on April
     25.  The primary server was out of service for most of the day, but
     both backups were available.

     The Netfind Seed Database for April contains about 1.3 million
     entries.  Growth was somewhat less than normal since we changed the
     database generation process to improve the accuracy of the
     database.  We continue to generate the database from data
     maintained by the registries, but we also check to see if the
     domain name defined by the record actually exists in DNS.  Since
     this check requires a large number of DNS lookups, we do not check
     every entry every month.  We do a different part of the database
     each month.

     THE US DOMAIN REGISTRY

     The US Domain registration form is now available online at
     http://www.isi.edu/us-domain.

     The US Domain has the maps of all the delegated special domains
     online at http://www.isi.edu/us-domain.

     The US Domain administrator no longer makes direct registrations of
     hosts, and only makes delegations of third or fourth level domain
     names (such as localities).

     Some of the processing of the requests to the third level domain
     name is now automated. In particular, most requests to register
     names in localities already delegated are automatically forwarded
     to the administrator of that locality.

     A new policy has been added regarding the charges for the domain
     name passed on during delegation.  The administrator of the
     locality has to notify one year in advance before charging for
     those domains.

Internet Monthly Report                                       April 1997


MERIT INTERNET ENGINEERING
--------------------------

     This report summarizes April 1997 activities of Merit's Internet
     Engineering group on behalf of the Routing Arbiter (RA) service and
     other projects.

     Two new mailing lists have been created by the Route Server Next
     Generation project.  Both lists were established in response to a
     discussion at the February 1997 Route Server BOF, held at the San
     Francisco NANOG.  The first list, RS-discuss@merit.edu, provides a
     forum for discussing Route Server technology, pros and cons of the
     service, issues with the existing service, and suggestions for
     improvement.  Abha Ahuja, Brad Robertson, Bill Norton, and Jake
     Khuon of the RSng staff hope that the list will stimulate broad
     discussion in the Internet community, addressing not only specific
     RSng issues, but also issues related to the use of Route Servers
     worldwide. The second list, RS-announce@merit.edu, will be used for
     announcements of Route Server maintenance and outages.  We
     recommend that all organizations peering with the Route Servers at
     the exchange points subscribe to this list.

     To subscribe to the new lists, send a message to
     majordomo@merit.edu with the following in the body of the message:

             subscribe rs-discuss

     or:

             subscribe rs-announce

     For more information about the Route Server Next Generation
     project, see:

             http://www.rsng.net

     Merit staff members Sue Hares, Bill Norton, Craig Labovitz, Jerry
     Winters, and Jake Khuon attended the 38th IETF in Memphis during
     the week of December 9.  Hares, who has been proposed as Chair of
     the Internet Research Task Force's Routing Research Group, chaired
     the Inter-Domain Routing Working Group meeting.  Labovitz
     demonstrated the NetNow and ASExplorer tools to ISPs and other
     researchers.  IETF was also the site of an informal Merit GateD
     Consortium meeting led by Hares.

Internet Monthly Report                                       April 1997


     Merit's Routing Arbiter Database support staff is playing an
     integral role in implementing the next-generation Routing Policy
     Specification Language (RPSL), which will replace RIPE-181 (RFC
     1786) as the language used to express routing policy in the RADB
     and other Internet Routing Registry databases.  The new language is
     being developed by the IETF Routing Policy System Working Group,
     which is chaired by Cengiz Alaettinoglu of the USC Information
     Sciences Institute and Daniel Karrenberg of the RIPE Network
     Coordination Centre.  RPSL offers many powerful new capabilities,
     most notably the ability to express routing policy much more
     precisely than in RIPE-181.

     Craig Labovitz' paper, "Internet Routing Instability," has been
     accepted to SIGCOMM '97.  Co-authored with student Robert Malan and
     Professor Farnam Jahanian of the University of Michigan Department
     of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, the paper examines
     the BGP updates exchanged between ISP border routers at the MAE-
     East, AADS, Sprint, and PacBell NAPs, and at MAE-West.  The authors
     describe several unexpected trends in routing instability, and
     examine a number of anomalies and pathologies observed in the
     exchange of inter-domain routing information.  The researchers then
     show that the volume of these routing updates is several orders of
     magnitude more than expected and that the majority of this routing
     information is redundant, or pathological.  Furthermore, the
     analysis reveals several unexpected trends and ill-behaved
     systematic properties in Internet routing.  Several explanations
     for these anomalies are put forth and evaluated with regard to
     their potential impact on the Internet infrastructure.

     The National Science Foundation funded much of Labovitz' research
     as part of Merit's Routing Arbiter project, a partnership with the
     USC Information Sciences Institute.

     Our CAIRN Link is now operational.

     A number of IETF WGs were attended in Memphis, as well as LSMA and
     IDMR being co-chaired. We presented at others, and wrote up the
     minutes for the new IRTF Reserarch Group on Reliable Multicast.

Internet Monthly Report                                       April 1997


     The Requests for Comments (RFCs) are a series of notes, started in
     1969, about the Internet (originally the ARPANET). The notes
     discuss many aspects of computing and computer communication
     focusing in networking protocols, procedures, programs, and
     concepts, but also including meeting notes, opinion, and sometimes
     humor. The specification documents of the Internet protocol suite,
     as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and its
     steering group (the IESG), are published as RFCs.

     RFCs-to-be are edited by the RFC Editor.  RFCs enter the RFC
     Editor's work queue either by an action of the IESG or by
     independent submission.  Most independent submissions are referred
     to the IESG to check for overlap with IETF work.  The IESG might
     put a hold on a document to gather more input from its members.
     The wait for an RFC to be published varies as there can be
     unforeseen complications (typically editorial matters that need
     clarification from the author).  Documents can be removed from the
     publication queue if they are found to be insufficient or incorrect
     or if the IESG asks the author to join work already in progress in
     the IETF.
