INTERNET MONTHLY REPORTS
------------------------

The purpose of these reports is to communicate to the Internet Research
Group the accomplishments, milestones reached, or problems discovered by
the participating organizations.

Each organization is expected to submit a 1/2 page report on the
first business day of the month describing the previous month's
activities.   These reports should be submitted via network mail
to "IMR-ED@ISI.EDU".

`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

The Internet Monthly Report mailing list is now managed by MajorDomo
at ISI.EDU.  The announcements of new issues on the Internet Monthly
Report are sent to the IETF-Announce list and to this IMR list.

Requests to be ADDED or DELETED from the Internet Monthly report list
should be sent to "majordomo@isi.edu" with the message body either
"subscribe imr" or "unsubscribe imr".

Details on obtaining the current IMR, or back issues, via FTP or EMAIL
may be obtained by sending an EMAIL message to "rfc-info@ISI.EDU" with
the message body "help: ways_to_get_imrs".  For example:

        To: rfc-info@ISI.EDU
        Subject: getting imrs

     THE US DOMAIN
     =============

     The US Domain registration information is available online at
     http://www.isi.edu/us-domain.

     Much of the processing of the requests to the third level domain
     name is now automated. In particular, most requests to register
     names in localities already delegated are automatically forwarded
     to the administrator of that locality.

MERIT INTERNET ENGINEERING
--------------------------

     This report summarizes October 1998 Internet engineering activities
     at Merit Network, Inc. (www.merit.edu).

     Merit is pleased to announce a limited beta release of IRRd Version
     1.1. The new release offers full e-mail/PGP support for database
     submissions. If you would like to participate in the beta trials,
     contact us by sending e-mail to irrd-support@merit.edu.

     IRRd is a freely available, stand-alone Internet Routing Registry
     database server that supports both RIPE-181 and RPSL routing
     registry syntaxes.  The code and documentation are available on the
     Merit Web pages:

             http://www.merit.edu/radb/irrd/

     The Route Server Next Generation (RSng) team installed Route
     Servers at the Automotive Network eXchange (ANX) in Southfield,
     Michigan.  The ANX, which is operated by the Automotive Industry
     Action Group, provides a secure IP network for trading partners
     throughout the automotive supply chain.  RSng oversees all RS
     operations at ANX, including configuration generation for the ANX
     routers, 7/24 system monitoring, and monitoring of peering

     include AADS, the Digital Internet Exchange, the PacBell NAP, MAE-
     East, and MAE-West.

UCL
----

     UCL Is putting togerther the program for IEEE/IFIP sponsored
     International Workshop on Quality of Service, to be held in London
     in Jun 1-4 1999. See http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/research/iwqos99/ for
     details, but there will be a 1 day workshop on Internet Pricing at
     the end of the 3 day paper sessions, which neatly dovetails with
     the ITC in Scotland the next week.

     * New RFCs added to queue throughout the month

     The Requests for Comments (RFCs) are a series of notes, started in
     1969, about the Internet (originally the ARPANET). The notes
     discuss many aspects of computing and computer communication
     focusing in networking protocols, procedures, programs, and
     concepts, but also including meeting notes, opinion, and sometimes
     humor. The specification documents of the Internet protocol suite,
     as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and its
     steering group (the IESG), are published as RFCs.

     RFCs-to-be are edited by the RFC Editor.  RFCs enter the RFC
     Editor's work queue either by an action of the IESG or by
     independent submission.  Most independent submissions are referred
     to the IESG to check for overlap with IETF work.  The IESG might
     put a hold on a document to gather more input from its members.
     The wait for an RFC to be published varies as there can be
     unforeseen complications (typically editorial matters that need
     clarification from the author).  Documents can be removed from the
     publication queue if they are found to be insufficient or incorrect
     or if the IESG asks the author to join work already in progress in
     the IETF.
