INTERNET ENGINEERING REPORTS
----------------------------

     1. By the time this is submitted, we will be attending the first
        IETF meeting of 1995 in Danvers, Massachusetts. The summer IETF
        meeting will be held in Stockholm, Sweden the week of July 17-
        21, 1995. Due to the meeting costs, the IETF attendance fee for
        the Stockholm meeting will be US$300. Hotel information has
        already been sent to the Announcement list, and attendees are
        encouraged to make their plane and hotel reservations. The IETF
        Secretariat is NOT accepting registrations for the Stockholm
        meeting at this time.

        Following Stockholm, the IETF will be meeting in Dallas, Texas
        on December 4-8, 1995. Our local host for this meeting is MCI.
        Once all the arrangements have been made, notifications will be
        sent to the IETF Announcement list. Remember that information
        on future IETF meetings can be always be found in the file 0mtg-
        sites.txt which is located on the IETF shadow directories. This
        information can also be viewed from the IETF Home Page on the
        Web. The URL is:

                     http://www.ietf.cnri.reston.va.us/

     2. The minutes of the IESG teleconferences have been publicly
        available on the IETF Shadow directories since 1991. These files
        are placed in the /ftp/iesg directory.

        The following IESG minutes have been added:

           February 23, 1995 (iesg.95-02-23)
           March 9, 1995 (iesg.95-03-09)

     3. The IESG approved or recommended the following 14 Protocol
        Actions during the month of March, 1995:

        o  A Border Gateway Protocol 3 (BGP-3) has been reclassified as
           Historic.

        o  Application of the Border Gateway Protocol in the Internet
           has been reclassified as Historic.

        o  The Transmission of IP Datagrams over the SMDS Service is now
           a Standard.

ANSNET/NSFNET BACKBONE ENGINEERING
----------------------------------

     March Backbone Traffic Statistics

     The total inbound packet count for the ANSnet (measured using SNMP
     interface counters) was 64,344,705,613 on T3 ENSS interfaces, up
     12.05% from February.  The total packet count into the network
     including all ENSS serial interfaces was 81,409,309,441 up 12.97% from
     February.

     Router Forwarding Table Statistics

     The maximum number of destinations announced to ANSnet during March
     was 22,326 up .51% from February.

     The number of network destinations configured for announcement to the
     ANSnet but never announced (silent nets) during February was 24,718.

INTERNIC
--------

     Internic Directory And Database Services
     =========================================

     As noted in last month's report, the scout-report and net-happenings
     mailing lists have been moved to the DS machines.  These are quite
     large mailing lists - the Scout Report has 21,000+ subscribers and
     net-happenings has 10,000+ (counting both the digest and non-digest
     versions).

     We have made a number of changes to our MajorDomo server to accomodate
     these lists.  We are batching subscription requests so they can be
     processed more efficiently.  This may result in a delay of up to a day
     before a request to be added to the list will be processed, but we
     have set up the timing so that the day's additions are normally
     processed before the day's mail is sent out.  Other changes have been
     made to the internals of MajorDomo, but they should not affect the
     mailing list as it appears to users.

     Subscribe and unsubscribe requests should continue to be sent to
     majordomo@dsmail.internic.net.

     We have also borrowed a more powerful machine from Sun (with thanks
     for their help) until more powerful permanent equipment can be
     obtained.

     These lists now appear to be stable and are operating normally.

     A reminder - if you would like to help the Internet community find a
     resource that you offer, send mail to admin@ds.internic.net and we
     will send information about listing your resource in the Directory of
     Directories.

     InterNIC Registration Services
     ==============================

     I.  Significant Events

     InterNIC Registration Services assigned over 11,012 network
     addresses and registered over 6,757 domains.  Three top level
     domains were registered this month for Mongolia (MN), Nigeria (NG),
     and Uganda (UG).

     The suit that Knowledgenet has filed against Network Solutions
     and David L. Boone over the knowledgement.com domain is still
     pending.  This case could establish precedence that refutes
     InterNIC Registration Service's current policy of first-come
     first served by binding trademarked names with a domain name.

     During the month of March, the increase of domain requests
     increased from an average of 200+ to 300+ new submissions per day.
     We have made adjustments in domain processing and staffing, as well
     as the implementation of additional equipment to aid in reducing the
     backlog.  At the close of March 1995, the processing time decreased
     from a high of 15 days to 12 days.


     II.  Current Status

     During the month of March 1995, InterNIC Registration Services
     received communications as shown below.  The majority of the
     correspondence concerned the assignment and re-assignment of
     network numbers and the registration or change of domain names.

          Postal/Fax    352    (primarily IP number requests)
          Phone       5,873

     The Registrations Services host computer supported a large volume
     of information retrieval requests during the month of February.

                     Connections   Retrievals
          Gopher      63,690          98,114

          Mailserv     5,535
          Telnet      81,677

     In addition, for WHOIS the number of queries were:

                       Client        Server
                      398,623     1,363,259

     ISI TUNNEL
     ==========

     ISI "Tunnel" Extensions in Response to the CERT IP Spoofing Advisory

     Background:

     The ISI Tunnel is a special router that provides smooth seamless
     internet access from a closed environment, the "inside", to the
     "outside", while restricting the access from the outside to the inside.
     The advantage of the Tunnel, in comparison with traditional firewalls,
     is that it supports any IP-based communication; not just terminal
     access, file transfer, and electronic mail.  The Tunnel allows sites
     that are hidden behind "firewalls", also known as "gatekeepers" or
     "mail-bridges", to have IP-based internet access without being open to
     attacks over the internet.  It was implemented at ISI in August, 1993.

     Potential Attack:

     The Tunnel firewall software, which is implemented in the Sun kernel IP
     code, uses the IP source and destination address for authentication on
     incoming packets.

     The CERT Advisory CA-95:01, "IP Spoofing Attacks and Hijacked Terminal
     Connections", dated January 23, 1995, outlines an attack in which IP
     source addresses are spoofed.

     The ISI Tunnel was vulnerable to this attack on two levels:

        a. The workstation that the Tunnel software is running on might
        accept a forged packet, allowing the forger to take control of
        the workstation and subvert the Tunnel software once root access
        has been gained.

b. IP forwarding decisions are made based on the source and
        destination addresses found in the IP header of a packet, so the
        Tunnel could be tricked into forwarding packets that should be
        discarded.

     Solution:

     Functionality has been added to the ISI Tunnel to address this
     problem.  In particular, the Tunnel packet filtering scheme has
     been modified to drop all packets that didn't come in on the
     interface suggested by their source address.

     This change was implemented inside of the the kernel that runs on
     the Tunnel router.  For each incoming packet, the standard kernel
     routine that is used to look up routes is called with the packet's
     IP source address.  The interface that is returned is compared with
     the interface on which the packet arrived, and if the two
     interfaces don't match, the packet is dropped.

     This technique can be applied to any Sun workstation, and has
     nothing specifically to do with the Tunnel software.

     There are several limitations associated with this approach.  In
     order for the routing lookup to yield the correct incoming
     interface, it must be assumed that packets are routed the same way
     in both directions.  Also, if a source address is spoofed in such a
     way that the packet is entering the gateway via the correct
     interface, it will not be detected using this method.

     The latest version of the Tunnel software is available via
     anonymous FTP from venera.isi.edu, "pub/tunnel/tunnel_2.0.tar.Z".

MERIT/NSFNET ENGINEERING
------------------------

     This report summarizes recent activities of Merit's Internet
     Engineering and Network Management groups on behalf of the Routing
     Arbiter (RA) Project and the NSFNET Backbone Service Project.

     The process of dismantling the NSFNET Backbone Service began this
     month, as ENSSs 138, 136, and 133 were turned off on March 11,
     March 22, and March 31, respectively.  Located in College Park and
     Atlanta, ENSSs 138 and 136 were the NSFNET connection points for
     SURAnet.  Located in Ithaca, NY, ENSS 133 was the NSFNET connection
     point for NYSERNet, the Cornell Theory Center, and PSI.  These
     terminations of service mean that SURAnet and NYSERNet are the
     first regionals to be totally dependent on their new service
     providers, internetMCI and SprintLink.  In addition, the Cornell
     Theory Center is the first supercomputer center to terminate its
     dependence on the NSFNET Backbone Service.

     ENSS 136 was also the NSFNET interconnection point with MAE-East.
     The NSFNET Backbone Service will continue to have connectivity to
     MAE-East+ until April 30, 1995.

     Merit has also discontinued the T1 "safety net" to 10 sites that
     have migrated to alternate service providers.

     Packet counts for the various access points to the NSFNET service
     show that most ENSSs have seen a reduction in traffic during the
     last six months.  A significant amount of traffic is still
     traversing the NSFNET, however.  Merit has posted a histogram that
     shows the number of packets into the nodes of the backbone from
     September 1994 to February 1995.  The histogram is available at:

         ftp://nic.merit.edu:/nsfnet/statistics/top10.transition.ps

         http://www.ra.net/stats.html
         http://www.ra.net/transpage.html

     The 10 nodes shown on the graph are the top 10 originators of
     traffic into the backbone in February 1995.  If you are attached to
     one of the nodes highlighted on the graph, please be aware that
     these attachments will be retired as of April 30, 1995.  More
     detailed information about NSFNET Backbone Service traffic can be
     found at nic.merit.edu:/nsfnet/statistics/*.

     The Routing Arbiter Project has added four new attributes to the
     RIPE-181 (RFC 1786) syntax, which is used to express routing policy
     in the Routing Arbiter Database.  The new attributes are:

         extended-as-in
         extended-as-out
         extended-interas-in
         extended-interas-out

     The "as-in" and "as-out" attributes, which are described in RFC
     1786, make it possible to specify routing policy at an AS
     granularity.  That is, if two ASs exchange routes, as-in and as-out
     describe the total of what routes are accepted and announced.  The
     "interas-in" and "interas-out" attributes, also described in RFC
     1786, are similar to as-in and as-out, but they make it possible to
     specify routing policy at a routing-session granularity.  The new
     attributes, extended-as-in, extended-as-out, extended- interas-in,
     and extended-interas-out, have the added capability of allowing the
     expression of routing policies that are based on AS paths.

     The Routing Arbiter Project has placed a second Route Server at
     MAE-East/MAE-East+.  Among the NSPs and ISPs receiving actual
     routes from the MAE-East/MAE-East+ Route Servers are NetCom, MCI,
     PIPEX, and Net 99.  Many thanks to these AS's for helping move the
     new technology along!
