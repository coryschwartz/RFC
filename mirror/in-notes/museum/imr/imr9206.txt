IAB MESSAGE

     A. IAB/IETF NOW PART OF ISOC

     Meeting in Kobe, Japan, on June 15, 1992, the Board of Trustees of
     the Internet Society voted to accept a recommendation from the
     Internet Activities Board to bring the IAB and all of its
     activities into the Internet Society, with the IAB serving as a
     technical advisory group of the ISOC.  The IETF will continue to
     pursue standards-setting and other engineering activities under
     this new umbrella, and the IRTF will continue to pursue research
     questions of importance to the Internet.

     The IAB was renamed the Internet Architecture Board.

     B. NEW POLICY ON POSTSCRIPT FOR STANDARDS DOCUMENTS

     Since 1989, the Internet policy set by the IAB has allowed
     Postscript RFC's but required that parallel ASCII versions exist as
     well.  The ASCII versions of Postscript have been allowed to be
     substandard, e.g., missing diagrams and not meeting the customary
     standards on format.

     Experience has shown that that the results have been less than
     satisfactory, and the IAB is now amending the policy in the
     following manner: RFCs that document standards-track specifications
     MUST have their reference text in ASCII.  That is, the ASCII
     version of standards-track specifications must be complete and
     properly formatted.  A secondary version in Postscript is still
     allowed, but its Status of Memo will note that it is not primary.

     No policy can be universal.  If the drafters of a standards
     specification RFC feel they have a legitimate need for using
     Postscript for the reference version of a specification, they
     should discuss this with the IESG, preferably early in the process.
     Exceptions will not be granted lightly, but nothing is impossible.

     This policy change affects only standards-track specifications;
     other RFC's will continue to follow the former rules.

     HISTORY AND BACKGROUND

     In 1989, there was a raging discussion on the question of
     Postscript RFCs, both on public mailing lists and within the IAB.
     Based upon the public discussion, the IAB at its July 1989 meeting
     agreed upon a dual-version policy.  This was reflected in the
     Instructions for RFC Authors and announced in the IAB REPORT



Cooper                                                          [Page 3]

Internet Monthly Report                                        June 1992


     [Internet Monthly Report, October 1989]:

         "The IAB has noted the intense concern in the community about
         Postscript-only RFC's; unfortunately, there is no ideal
         solution for this problem.  Until ODA or its equivalent is
         widely available, some combination of ASCII and Postscript is
         the best we can do.  The IAB has instructed the RFC Editor to
         obtain an ASCII version from the author of any Postscript-only
         document whenever possible, and both versions are to be made
         publically available.  Although the dual versions may cause
         significant extra work for both authors and editor, this
         appears to be the only feasible compromise."

     In the succeeding three years, the situation has not improved.  ODA
     has not saved us, and the drawbacks of Postscript noted in July
     1989:

         1) printing capability is not universal
         2) difficult to cut and paste
         3) difficult to search
         4) file sizes are too large
         5) unable to view from a terminal

     are unchanged.  Typically, we have found that the ASCII versions of
     Postscript specifications have been derived mechanically, with
     minimal or no editorial effort.  The result has been unreadability
     at best and at worst typographic errors in specifications where
     precision is required and expected.

     What has changed in three years is the economic significance of the
     Internet standards process.  As a result, the Internet community in
     general and the IAB in particular have lavished a great deal of
     time and effort to improve the quality of our standards process
     while attempting to preserve its manifest virtues.

     There is no question in anyone's mind that Postscript documents are
     prettier and perhaps easier to read than corresponding ASCII
     documents.  However, we believe that other issues are paramount for
     the formal specification of protocols and procedures.  In
     particular, a reference specification must be universally
     printable, and it must be possible to cut-and-paste machine-
     processable program fragments from the text.  It should be possible
     to easily search for desired text.

     When fancy explanatory diagrams are desired, it may be appropriate
     to create two documents, an introductory document in Postscript and
     the formal specification in ASCII.  We have a great deal of
     experience with using ASCII to effectively document Internet



Cooper                                                          [Page 4]

Internet Monthly Report                                        June 1992


     protocols and procedures, and we believe that a carefully written
     ASCII document can convey the desired information clearly and
     precisely.  It may be hoped that the restriction to a single font
     will encourage authors to make every word count.

     This policy was proposed to the IETF on May 28, 1992, and was very
     extensively discussed on the IETF mailing list.  The great majority
     of comments received by the IAB were strongly in favor of this
     change.  Therefore, it was formally adopted by the IAB at its Kobe
     meeting.

     RESOURCE DISCOVERY AND DIRECTORY SERVICE
     ----------------------------------------

        Several members of the research group have been discussing
        conceptual and implementation relationships between Internet
        resource discovery systems, towards the goal of supporting
        seamless interoperation of resource discovery using multiple
        underlying systems.  To help analyze the problem, we are
        developing a taxonomy with dimensions concerning resource
        granularity, distribution, interconnection topology, and data
        integration mechanism.  This taxonomy provides inferences about
        the ability of a system to support organizing, browsing, and
        searching operations, and about what is needed to provide
        gateways between individual systems.

INTERNET ENGINEERING REPORTS
----------------------------

     1. The Fall IETF is scheduled for November 16-20, 1992 in
        Washington, DC. Our local host is U.S. Sprint. The Spring
        1993 IETF will be held in Columbus, Ohio, March 28th -
        April 2nd, hosted by OARnet and The Ohio State University.

     2. The IESG received one request to consider the following
        Internet Draft as a standards track item:

        a. "BGP OSPF Interaction" <draft-ietf-bgp-ospfinteract-06>
           be published as a Proposed Standard.

        Additionally, the IESG is considering RFC 1144 "Compressing
        TCP/IP headers for low-speed serial links" for Draft Standard
        status.  RFC 1144 was published as a Proposed Standard in
        December 1990.

        Last Call notifications were sent to the IETF list on both
        items.

     3. The IESG made the following recommendations to the IAB during
        the month of June 1992:

        a. RFC0734 (SUPDUP), RFC0913 (Simple File Transfer Protocol),
           RFC0953 (Hostname Server), and RFC1037 (NFILE - a file
           access protocol) be moved to Historical Standard status.

        b. RFC1139 (Echo function for ISO 8473) remain a Proposed
           Standard

        c. RFC783 (THE TFTP PROTOCOL-REVISION 2) as documented/updated
           in <draft-ietf-iesg-tftp-00>, be published as an Internet
           Standard.

        d. RFC1056 (PCMAIL) be moved off the Standards Track and be
           republished as an Informational Protocol.

        e. RFC1058 (Routing Information Protocol) be elevated to
           Standard Status. RIP was elevated to Draft Standard
           in April 1990.

        f. The Inter-Domain Policy Routing (IDPR) Protocol be
           elevated to Proposed Standard Status. IDPR is defined
           in the following Internet Drafts:

     ST Conferencing

     During June, the TWB supported 8 point-to-point conferences, as
     well as numerous test conferences.  Test conferences were run
     almost daily to bring up new sites, rehearse for demos, do
     communications testing for exercises, and field test new software.

     Floor control software has been deployed to 8 of the 18 video
     gateway sites on the TWB.  Deployments to the remaining sites are
     continuing, although some sites have not yet provided Suns at their
     locations, and so are unable to use floor control locally.  The
     first operational use of floor control was unsuccessful, due to an
     incorrect hostname configured on a Sun at DARPA.  DARPA
     subsequently changed the hostname, and additional testing showed no
     other problems.

     Three TWB sites have been converted to secure installations for
     demonstrations of E3 simulation and conferencing.  These sites
     (IDA, Ft.  Rucker, and BBN-DWS) are no longer available for regular
     conferencing on an ad-hoc basis.  We do have the ability to switch
     these sites, with appropriate warning, when necessary for important
     non-secure activities.  During a demonstration in June, IDA and
     BBN-DWS successfully conducted a secure simulation demonstration
     for a group at IDA.

     During June, Ft. Knox, Ft. Rucker, and RADC converted from
     butterfly to T/20 gateways.  These were the last
     conferencing/simulation sites to make the switch.  Only two
     butterfly gateways remain on the TWB.

     GIGABIT NETWORKING

     ATOMIC

     The ATOMIC project took delivery of its first 3-by-3 interhost
     router (Mosaic mesh) board.  Functioning 8-by-8 mesh boards are
     also now being tested at Caltech.  This 3-by-3 router can directly
     interconnect twelve hosts and should provide approximately 5 Gb/s
     of routing capacity.  AC, Mosiac and UNIX kernel work was done to
     prepare for the use of N-by-N mesh routers in the ATOMIC network.

     Router enclosure design and channel-cable adaptor board fabrication
     were completed earlier this year.  Assembly and initial testing of
     the ATOMIC router prototype will begin in July.  Testing will
     determine mesh router capacity and will provide more interesting
     topology for the ATOMIC discovery and routing database program, the
     Address Consultant (AC).

     Work on the AC in June centered on the automatic discovery and
     display of network topology and detection/prevention of deadlocks.
     The AC can now dynamically map the topology of ATOMIC networks and
     create complete source-routing tables.  Automatic interrogation of
     the AC is implemented within the BSD UNIX kernel, to provide hosts
     with source routes.

     Multiple ACs can run simultaneously in different hosts.  A
     distributed election mechanism ensures that only one AC becomes the
     "controlling" AC.  The remainder remain dormant awaiting the
     possible failure of the controlling AC, at which point a new
     election occurs.

     The issue of fault isolation for Mosaic channels in an office
     environment was considered during June.  A document that outlines
     one approach toward isolation of channel faults was sent to
     Caltech, where the Mosaic project is designing and prototyping a
     many-meter Mosaic channel transmission chip.  Fault isolation is
     important since power failures, bugs, attacks and hardware failures
     are a part of the real networking world.

     MULTIMEDIA CONFERENCING

     The initial implementation of the Connection Control Protocol (CCP)
     was completed this month and will now be tested over DARTnet.  CCP
     is an experimental application layer protocol designed to
     facilitate multimedia teleconferencing over the Internet.  It
     orchestrates multiple-user, multiple-media sessions in a
     distributed manner, providing among other functions a flexible
     group transaction service, robustness mechanisms for WAN operation

     and negotiation for heterogeneous end system configurations.

     We are working with students from USC on software decoding of the
     compressed video used in DARTnet experiments.  Displaying video in
     a workstation window rather than on a separate monitor facilitates
     a "personal conferencing" mode.  Software decoding will also enable
     DARTnet experiments employing a larger number of receivers without
     additional hardware cost.  We have completed the decoding routines
     which will be integrated with packet reception and X-window display
     software by the students.

     An article was submitted to Computer Communications Review on the
     first IETF meeting "audiocast" from San Diego.  Meanwhile,
     preparations are underway for a second audiocast from the Boston
     IETF in July, this time also including video and expected to reach
     a much larger audience.

             The monitoring agents can monitor any entity, protocol, or
             variable. To date, the monitoring agents developed are:
                 IP ICMP monitor (ping or multiping)
                 OSI reachability monitor (OSI ping)
                 SNMP trap monitor
                 IP data throughput monitor
                 Nameserver (named) monitor
                 Monitor for number of terminal server lines in use
                         (for cisco terminal servers using xtacacs)

             The software is flexible and permits enhancements and
             development with minimal effort. It is easy to add
             monitors for DECnet and/or other protocols.  The program
             was evaluated on SUNOS4.1.1, Ultrix, and NeXT.

LOS NETTOS
----------

     We experienced an extended T1 outage on a redundant link because
     GTE used type A Westel demarc's which would not respond to telco
     loop up commands.  GTE therefore wasted a lot of time trying to
     repair the wrong end of the line.

     GTE swapped out the type A Westels for a newer model that responds
     to remote loop up commands.

     We plan to produce a short version of the Guide as a companion to
     the present guide.  We will also continue the present format with
     the modifications noted below.  For the Compact Internet Resource
     Guide, we are asking each contributor to prepare a ONE-LINER -- a
     summary containing only the most essential description of the
     Resource, in 72 characters or less.  The Introduction to the
     Compact Guide will direct the user who wishes to learn more to the
     Resource Guide itself, and, at the contributor's option, to longer
     documents.

     The Internet Resource Guide has been very well received in the
     Internet community.  The Compact Guide should make it easier for
     users to get an idea of the Resources that are available, and
     encourage other Resource providers to contribute entries to the
     Guide.

NSFNET/ANSNET BACKBONE ENGINEERING
----------------------------------

     T3 Backbone Status
     ==================

     The T3 Backbone continued to run very reliably during June.  With
     the completion of the RS/960 DS3 interface upgrade in May, the
     cutover of additional traffic from the T1 to the T3 network resumed
     in June and is proceeding as quickly as possible.  The number of
     networks configured and announced to the T3 network continues to
     increase.  Midlevel traffic cut over from the T1 to the T3 backbone
     included NorthWestNet, Sprint/International Connections Manager,
     and Alternet.  The T3 backbone is now carrying nearly double the
     packet load of that of the T1 backbone.

     With the upgrade complete and the T3 network stable, several
     performance and functional enhancements have been administered
     during June.  Improvements to the routing daemon and SNMP daemon
     were made.  A remaining problem on the T3 network is the FDDI
     adapter performance and stability.  Due to the complexity of the T3
     adapter upgrade, we chose to defer the FDDI upgrade until August to
     ensure operational stability.

Internet Monthly Report                                        June 1992


     Statistics on network traffic and configured networks
     =====================================================

     The total inbound packet count for the T3 network was
     10,736,059,912,up 29% from April.  220,593,003 of these packets
     entered from the T1 network.  The total inbound packet count for
     the T1 network was 5,761,976,518, down 16.7% from May.  536,009,585
     of these packets entered from the T3 network.  The combined total
     inbound packet count for the T1 and T3 networks (less cross network
     traffic) was 15,741,433,842, up 0.9% from April.

     Currently there are 5801 IP networks configured in the policy
     routing database for the T1 network, and 3966 for the T3 network.
     Actual announced networks to the backbone varies and is currently
     2750 for T3 and 4425 for T1.

     NOC Problem Reports
     ===================

     The number of problem reports that result in NOC trouble tickets
     (total all priority classes) for the T3 network remains constant at
     10-20 per week, and for the T1 network it remains at the 15-20 rate
     per week.

     T1 Backbone Status
     ==================

     The T1 backbone's reliability is not as good as T3, due largely to
     increased route processing on the RCP nodes.  The full load of
     routes is still being carried by these machines, and they are
     experiencing congestion and performance problems to some degree.
     Improvements have been made to the routing software to accomodate
     protocol upgrades (ie.  BGP2).

     T3 Routing Daemon Software Status
     =================================

     Activities related to the rcp_routed software in June emphasized
     correcting software problems involving routing instability, and
     monitoring & correcting routing table integrity problems. There
     were many bug fixes applied to the routing daemon over the last
     three months.

     Monitoring of routing integrity consists of data collection of the
     full netstat table to find route flapping problems within the
     backbone and within peer networks, BGP disconnect problems, and
     external network metric problems. Additional work is underway to
     collect full routing tables from backbone nodes to be processed

     using a relational database system. This system generates reports
     on the statistical use of primary routes, reliability of network
     announcements to the backbone, and long term statistics on inter-
     domain routing announcements and growth.

     A number of improvements and bug fixes have been made to the T3
     routing software over the last two months. Highlights included: fix
     to allow an ENSS that is isolated from the backbone to stop
     announcing default to peers, better handling of router adapter
     failures, preventing overruns of external BGP messages sent to
     external peer routers, gracefully dropping bogus external routes to
     backbone ENSS nodes, correct response to external metric selection
     problem for nets announced at same metric from multiple peers,
     problem with interaction between BGP and EGP for peers in the same
     Autonomous System, hashing route table efficiency improvements, two
     routes with same AS path are now both installed to allow backup,
     BGP-2 PDU size increased from 1024 to 4096 bytes, route from BGP
     and EGP with same metric now prefers BGP route, better handling of
     next hop behind peer router and shared network, BGP update packet
     format fix, fix to BGP 1-2 version negotiation, eliminated chance
     of BGP disconnects during IGP transitions, eliminating BGP
     disconnects if peer router is too busy, better response to route
     instabilities upon failure of T1 interconnect or ENSS, and
     autorestart of the routing daemon in the event of a crash.

     As a result of the monitoring and analysis effort along with the
     actual software changes, reliability and route integrity has
     improved dramatically on the T3 network over the last month.

     RS/960 DS3 On-Card Memory Problem
     =================================

     A batch of bad memory chips have been found to result in memory
     parity errors on a few interfaces.  Five of these cards have been
     replaced as the problems have been identified. Diagnostic microcode
     has been developed to detect the problems in advance, and nodes are
     being scheduled for diagnostics to be run over the next few weeks
     during routing configuration update scheduled windows.

     DSU Synchronization and CRC/alignment Problem
     =============================================

     A problem that causes logical link failures has been traced to a
     clock synchronization problem on the T3 Technologies DSU's during
     clock master/slave transitions. This problem occurs very
     infrequently and has been reproduced using a newly installed
     circuit on the T3 research network. Enhanced instrumentation has
     been added to detect this problem, and work is in progress to

Internet Monthly Report                                        June 1992


     correct it.

     End-To-End Packet Loss Analysis
     ===============================

     Researchers at University of Maryland recently conducted some
     experiments and noticed periodic and random packet loss and packet
     duplicates when using the T3 network. There were two problems
     traced to a bridge device and an ethernet problem on the SURAnet
     ethernet.  Peer router problems causing some packet loss during
     routing updates at NEARnet were identified and are being corrected.
     Also some packet loss on the T3 ENSS FDDI interface at Stanford was
     identified.  This is due to an FDDI card output buffering problem
     and might be addressed prior to the FDDI upgrade in August.

     FDDI Adapter Upgrade
     ====================

     Although the T3 adapters have been upgraded from older technology
     to the new RS960 adapter technology, the FDDI adapters in the ENSS
     nodes have not yet been upgraded.  The older FDDI adapters continue
     to suffer from performance on reliability problems.

     The new RS960 FDDI adapter is scheduled to be installed as part of
     a field trial on July 20th.  Following this field trial, we expect
     to upgrade the older FDDI interfaces with the new RS960 interface
     adapters in early August. There are currently five T3 ENSS sites
     that are using FDDI interfaces in production.

     SNMP Daemon Changes
     ===================

     A new version of the SNMP daemon for the T3 network was installed
     on June 26. This version supports MIB-II variables for the T/960
     ethernet cards (ifInUcastPkts, ifOutUcastPkts, and ifInErrors), and
     also includes enhanced configuration support for monitoring T3
     DSUs.

     A new SNMP client for the NOC to control the T1 Cylink ACSUs which
     are part of the T3 backbone has been implemented. This avoids use
     of a separate dial-in connection to these CSUs.

     New SNMP variables have been added to furthermonitor the DSU
     synchronization problem mentioned above.

     Ian Wakeman and Mark Handley attended INET 92 in Kobe, Japan, and
     gave papers on "Analysis of UK-US Transatlantic Traffic" and
     "Multimedia Conferencing: From Prototype to National Pilot".  These
     can be ftp'd from cs.ucl.ac.uk:docs/rntraffic.ps.Z and
     cs.ucl.ac.uk:car/car-inet92.ps.Z both (Unix) compressed
     (Adobe)postscript

     Peter Kirstein, Paul Tsuchiya and Steve Hardcastle-Kille also
     attended.

     Work is in hand on a new multicast routing algorithm, called Core
     Based Trees (crowcroft, ballardie, tsuchiya).

     1.   The end2end research group meeting was held at the University
          of Delaware on 9-10 June.

     2.   Measurements continue with the NTP version-3 daemon for Unix
          as modified to support a one-pulse-per-second signal generated
          by some timecode receivers and precision oscillators.
          Preliminary results were presented at the end2end research
          meeting. While incidental jitter has been reduced to a few
          tens of microseconds, the frequency stability, typically a few
          parts in 10**7, is limited by the oscillator wander and
          crystal aging found in typical computer clocks.

     3.   A comprehensive technical report on precision computer
          timekeeping can be found on louie.udel.edu in the compressed
          tar archive pub/ntp/doc/timex.tar.Z. The files included are in
          PostScript format and are rich in diagrams and equations.

     4.   Our burgeoning antenna farm at two sites now feeds two WWVB
          timecode receivers, three WWV receivers, two GPS receivers,
          two LORAN-C receivers and a CHU receiver. Aging fuzzball
          primary time server dcn1.udel.edu has been replaced by a
          dedicated Sun IPC at the same address and synchronized to
          WWVB. Senile fuzzball primary time server dcn5.udel.edu has
          been replaced by a dedicated Bancomm bc700LAN integrated NTP
          time server at the same address and synchronized to GPS.

     USENET READERSHIP SUMMARY REPORT for Jun 92 This is the first
     article in a monthly posting series from the Network Measurement
     Project at the DEC Western Research Laboratory in Palo Alto,
     California.

     This survey is based on a sample of data taken from various USENET
     sites.  At the end of this message there is a short explanation of
     the measurement techniques and the meaning of the various
     statistics. The messages that follow this one show survey data
     sorted by various criteria.

     The newsgroup volume and article counts that I post are often
     significantly different from the ones posted by Rick Adams, because
     he includes the size of a crossposted article in every group to
     which it is posted, whereas I charge that size only to the first-
     named group.

     The complete set of readership data (of which this is a summary) is
     posted in news.lists. The software that will let your site
     participate in the survey is in comp.sources.d and news.admin

     During June the Pilot DSA was up and running almost continuously.
     Starting in July, we will collect statistics on Pilot usage.  These
     will be reported beginning in August.

     Work has progressed on extending the scope and accessibility of the
     Pilot.  An account has been set up to enable dialup DUA access for
     other agency staff.  On login, the Widget DUA user interface is
     automatically brought up, providing access to the Pilot DSA.  Some
     details remain to be worked out, but dial-up access is expected to
     begin by the end of July.

     We are continuing to pursue TP4/CLNP accessibility to the Pilot DSA
     over FTS A and B.  The impediments have to do with establishing an
     OSI routing path from the NIST FTS access machine to the machine
     running the Pilot DSA.

     NIST X.500 Implementation
     -------------------------
     Improvements were caried out in two areas of the Custos code during
     June. A problem with the result of the List operation, in which the
     origin of the information carried in the result was incorrectly
     flagged, was corrected, and the code for the Search operation was
     enhanced to enable Search to operate on all naming contexts,
     regardless of whether the naming context has been loaded into
     memory at startup.

     Future Plans
     ------------
     We have continued our work with NASA, DHHS, and other agencies to
     establish Internet and FTS2000 connectivity to the pilot DSA.  We
     have begun a dialog with Dallas Day of Wright-Patterson AFB on the
     integration of his base's OSIWare DSA into the Pilot, and have had
     similar discussions with Doug Harsha from the Department of
     Agriculture in Ft. Collins, CO.  We have also initiated discussions
     with NIST's Computing and Applied Mathematics Laboratory on a
     collaborative venture to provide a NIST-wide white pages directory
     service. The plan is to provide telephone/email/addressing
     information on NIST staff to the desktop, via PC and Macintosh
     based DUA packages.  We expect that this can serve as a model for
     other agencies interested in deploying the OSI Directory.
