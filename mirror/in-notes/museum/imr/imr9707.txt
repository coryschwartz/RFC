INTERNET MONTHLY REPORTS
------------------------

The purpose of these reports is to communicate to the Internet Research
Group the accomplishments, milestones reached, or problems discovered by
the participating organizations.

Each organization is expected to submit a 1/2 page report on the first
business day of the month describing the previous month's activities.
These reports should be submitted via network mail to "IMR-ED@ISI.EDU".

`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

The Internet Monthly Report mailing list is now managed by MajorDomo at
ISI.EDU.  The announcements of new issues on the Internet Monthly Report
are sent to the IETF-Announce list and to this IMR list.

Requests to be ADDED or DELETED from the Internet Monthly report list
should be sent to "majordomo@isi.edu" with the message body either
"subscribe imr" or "unsubscribe imr".

Details on obtaining the current IMR, or back issues, via FTP or EMAIL
may be obtained by sending an EMAIL message to "rfc-info@ISI.EDU" with
the message body "help: ways_to_get_imrs".  For example:

        To: rfc-info@ISI.EDU

                 Internet Monthly Report for July, 1997


  1. As I write this, we are about to leave for the IETF Meeting in
     Munich, Germany. Our hosts for this meeting Digi/ISOC.DE. The
     final meeting of the year will be held in Washington, DC from
     December 8-12, 1997. Our local host is Newbridge Networks. The
     IETF will meet in Los Angeles from March 30 - April, 3, 1998 and
     then in Chicago August 24-28. We're still looking into the final
     meeting of 1998.

     Once all arrangements have been made, notifications will be sent
     to the IETF Announcement list. Remember that information on
     future meetng sites can always be found in the file
     0mtg-sites.txt, located on the IETF shadow directories. Of
     course, this information is provided on the Web. The IETF's URL
     is:

                          http://www.ietf.org/

  2. The minutes of the IESG teleconferences be found on all the IETF
     shadow directories in the iesg directory.

     The following IESG minutes have been added:

     THE US DOMAIN
     =============

     A total of about 2000 locality domains that were delegated to several
     domain name managers have been returned to the US Domain
     administrator.  These localities will be made available for
     redelegation in the coming months.

     A new policy has been added regarding the locality delegation.  For
     delegations (or redelegations) made after 1-Jul-97, it is assumed by
     the US Domain Administrator that every applicant for the delegation (or
     redelegation) of a locality name has the written agreement of the
     legitimate government for that locality for the applicant to manage the
     domain name of that locality.

     Evidience of such an agreement does not need to be presented at the
     time of delegation (except that the administrative contact on the
     application template must be the government representative).  However,
     if the delegation is later challenged or contested, the manager of the
     locality domain must produce the agreement.  Failure to do so will
     most likely result in the transfer of the management of the locality
     domain to another manager that does have such an agreement.

     If there is a dispute as to what is the legitimate government for a
     locality is and who may act for it, the league of cities or
     association of municipalities of that state (as recognized by the
     National League of Cities) may be asked to assist in resolving such
     disputes.

     In some places there are overlapping jurisdictions with the same name
     (for example, the city of Los Angeles and the county of Los Angeles).
     In such cases, the higher level government should have priority.

     The US Domain registration form is now available online at
     http://www.isi.edu/us-domain.

     The US Domain has the maps of all the delegated special domains
     online at http://www.isi.edu/us-domain.

     The US Domain administrator no longer makes direct registrations of
     hosts, and only makes delegations of third or fourth level domain
     names (such as localities).

     Some of the processing of the requests to the third level domain
     name is now automated. In particular, most requests to register
     names in localities already delegated are automatically forwarded to
     the administrator of that locality.

     A new policy has been added regarding the charges for the domain name
     passed on during delegation.  The administrator of the locality has to
     notify one year in advance before charging for those domains.

MERIT INTERNET ENGINEERING
--------------------------

     This report summarizes July 1997 activities of Merit's Internet
     Engineering group on behalf of the Routing Arbiter (RA) service and
     other projects.

     Organizations that are peering with the Route Server Next
     Generation (RSng) project's Route Servers can use a new Web
     Interface to check the parameters of their peering session:

               http://www.rsng.net/peer_template/viewconf.html

     The new form displays public fields in RSng's extended 'inet-rtr'
     (Internet router) objects, which specify routes that the Route
     Server should import and export on behalf of each peer.  The RSng
     inet-rtr object, which was developed by Jake Khuon, extends the
     definition found in the RIPE document, "Specifying an `Internet
     Router' in the Routing Registry" (RIPE-122).

     To use the Configuration Viewer to view an RSng inet-rtr object,
     simply enter the IP address or AS number of the peer you want to
     obtain information about.  The Configuration Viewer only displays
     public information about routes exchanged with the Route Servers,
     rather than private network contact information.  The Configuration
     Viewer was developed by Abha Ahuja.

     ------------------------------------------------------------

     Merit is pleased to announce a new, distributed version of its
     Internet Rover package.  Developed by Bill Norton to monitor
     network devices for the NSFNET project, the Rover code is now used
     to monitor networks worldwide, including the Italian National
     Network, the Pentagon Network, and the Princeton Network.

Internet Monthly Report                                        July 1997


     The previous, centralized Rover code was based on a simple model:
     if a device failed a test, an alert would be displayed at the
     Network Operations Center.  NOC operators would then investigate
     the cause of the failed test and take any necessary action.  When
     the test succeeded, the alert would be removed.

     Over the past ten years, Merit programming staff have worked with
     many network operators to evolve the software package to meet their
     needs.  The latest release, Internet Rover 4.0, introduces the
     notion of distributed "Area Managers" into the model.  The Area
     Managers, which perform tests and maintain a list of alerts on
     remote systems, use an SNMP agent to externalize the list of alerts
     to the Central Network Management Stations (CNMS).  In this way,
     the Distributed Rovers can be deployed and connected across a
     wide-area network.

     Locating the Area Managers topologically closer to the devices
     being monitored decreases the likelihood of packet loss from
     intermediate network failures, and lowers network management
     bandwidth requirements.

     In addition, the Distributed Rovers can be split along
     administrative boundaries, such as AS's, making it possible for
     networks to share aggregated network management information.  NOCs
     can then "view" one another's alert screens, making it much easier
     to operate backup NOCs and share NOC services.

     For more information about the new Rover code, see:

                     http://www.merit.edu/internet.tools/rover/

     A new mailing list provides a forum for user feedback to the Rover
     developers. To join, send e-mail to majordomo@merit.edu with
     'subscribe your.email.address rover@merit.edu' (without the quotes)
     as the only text.

     Engineer Craig Labovitz and Merit President Eric Aupperle attended
     an Internet Service Quality Workshop sponsored by Bellcore, which
     featured presentations on future differentiated services for the
     Internet.  Bill Norton, Jake Khuon, and Abha Ahuja of the RSng
     staff attended a PacBell NAP open house. Route Servers managed by
     the Route Server Next Generation project (www.rsng.net/) are up and
     running at the Digital Internet Exchange and the AADS, MAE-West,
     MAE-East interconnection points, in addition to the PacBell NAP.

     * New RFCs added to queue throughout the month

     The Requests for Comments (RFCs) are a series of notes, started in
     1969, about the Internet (originally the ARPANET). The notes discuss
     many aspects of computing and computer communication focusing in
     networking protocols, procedures, programs, and concepts, but also
     including meeting notes, opinion, and sometimes humor. The
     specification documents of the Internet protocol suite, as defined by
     the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and its steering group (the
     IESG), are published as RFCs.

     RFCs-to-be are edited by the RFC Editor.  RFCs enter the RFC Editor's
     work queue either by an action of the IESG or by independent
     submission.  Most independent submissions are referred to the IESG to
     check for overlap with IETF work.  The IESG might put a hold on a
     document to gather more input from its members.  The wait for an RFC
     to be published varies as there can be unforeseen complications
     (typically editorial matters that need clarification from the author).
     Documents can be removed from the publication queue if they are found
     to be insufficient or incorrect or if the IESG asks the author to join
     work already in progress in the IETF.
