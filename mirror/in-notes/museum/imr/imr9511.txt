INTERNET MONTHLY REPORTS
------------------------

The purpose of these reports is to communicate to the Internet Research
Group the accomplishments, milestones reached, or problems discovered by
the participating organizations.

     This report is for Internet information purposes only, and is not
     to be quoted in other publications without permission from the
     submitter.

Each organization is expected to submit a 1/2 page report on the first
business day of the month describing the previous month's activities.

These reports should be submitted via network mail to "IMR@ISI.EDU".

Requests to be added or deleted from the Internet Monthly report list
should be sent to "imr-request@isi.edu".

     Details on obtaining the current IMR, or back issues, via FTP or
     EMAIL may be obtained by sending an EMAIL message to "rfc-
     info@ISI.EDU" with the message body "help: ways_to_get_imrs".  For
     example:

             To: rfc-info@ISI.EDU

     The minutes of the IAB back to 1990 are available for anonymous ftp
     access on host ftp.isi.edu, directory /pub/IAB, or via the IAB

INTERNET ENGINEERING REPORTS
----------------------------

     1. Following Dallas, the IETF will be meeting in Los Angeles,
        California from March 4-8, 1996. There will not be a local host
        for this meeting, but the terminal room facilities will be
        provided by Interop. Following Los Angeles, the IETF will be
        meeting in Montreal, Quebec, Canada from June 24-28, 1996. If
        this date looks familiar, it is the same date as INET '96! This
        is not a "joint" meeting, but both will be held in the Montreal
        Convention Center. Closing out the year, the IETF will be
        returning to San Jose, California on December 9-13, 1996.

        Once all the arrangements have been made, notifications will be
        sent to the IETF Announcement list. Remember that information
        on future IETF meetings can be always be found in the file
        0mtg-sites.txt which is located on the IETF shadow directories.
        This information can also be viewed from the IETF Home Page on
        the Web. The URL is:

                     http://www.ietf.cnri.reston.va.us


     2. The minutes of the IESG teleconferences have been publicly
        available on the IETF Shadow directories since 1991. These files
        are placed in the /ftp/iesg directory.

        The following IESG minutes have been added:

           October 12, 1995 (iesg.95-10-12)
           October 26, 1995 (iesg.95-10-26)


     3. The IESG approved or recommended the following five Protocol
        Actions during the month of November, 1995:

        o  RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal
           Control be published as a Proposed Standard.

        o  RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications be
           published as a Proposed Standard.

        o  SGML Media Types be published as an Experimental Protocol.

        o  Message/External-Body Content-ID Access Type be published as
           an Experimental Protocol.

        o  The MIME Multipart/Related Content-type be published as an
           Experimental Protocol.


     4. The IESG issued four Last Calls to the IETF during the month of
        November, 1995:

        o  Definitions of Managed Objects for the Fourth Version of
           Border Gateway Protocol (BGP-4) <draft-ietf-idr-bgp4-mib-00>
           for consideration as a Draft Standard.

        o  Username/Password Authentication for SOCKS V5
           <draft-ietf-aft-username-password-01> for consideration as
           a Proposed Standard.

        o  Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol <draft-ietf-dhc-dhcp-06>
           for consideration as a Draft Standard.

        o  SOCKS Protocol Version 5
           <draft-ietf-aft-socks-protocol-v5-05> for consideration as
           a Proposed Standard.



     5. Two Working Groups were created during this period:

           SNMP Agent Extensibility (agentx)
           Application MIB (applmib)

        and one working group was concluded:

INTERNET PROJECTS
-----------------

INTERNIC
--------

     REGISTRATION SERVICES

     I.  Significant Events

     InterNIC Registration Services assigned over 5,968 network
     addresses and registered over 20,612 domains.  There was one top-
     level country domain registered during November: Angola (AO).

     On November 23, 1995, revision 1 to the Domain Name Dispute Policy
     went into effect, and is available for review by the internet
     community.

     Implemented a new version of the DomReg application that mails only
     one response back to the sender and copies others that are
     associated with the domain(s).

     A glossary of common error messages encountered during the Domain
     Registration process has been made available to the Internet user
     community via /home/ftp/templates/domain-parser-errors.txt.

     The Shared WHOIS Project (SWIP) parser and auto processor for the
     network numbers registration area was completed.

     The draft Request For Comments (RFC) for IP location was submitted.

     During the month of November, domain requests continue to average
     between 1,000 - 1,500+ for new submissions per day. Adjustments
     continue to be made in domain programs/processing.  The domain
     processing queue increased from 1,000+ at the close of October
     1995, new domain registration requests to 4,600+ by the end of
     November.

     II.  Current Status

     During the month of November 1995, InterNIC Registration Services
     received communications as shown below.  The majority of the
     correspondence concerned the assignment and re-assignment of
     network numbers and the registration or change of domain names.

          E-mail     60,958     (hostmaster@internic.net)
          Postal/Fax    360    (primarily IP number requests)
          Phone      17,592

     The Registration Services host computer supported the following
     information retrieval requests during the month of November:

                     Connections   Retrievals
          Gopher      43,919            86,541
          WAIS        98,644            57,967
          FTP         53,756           148,625
          Mailserv     3,938
          Telnet      95,700
          Http       876,433

     In addition, for WHOIS the number of queries were:

                       Client        Server
                      _______       _________

                      540,845       3,634,642

     INTERNIC DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES

     In November, we upgraded WAIS on our systems to FreeWAIS Version
     0.5 from CNIDR.  The new version includes performance improvements
     over our previous version (FreeWAIS Version 0.3), provides bug
     fixes which should improve reliabilty, supports additional target
     environments, and provides enhanced support for word pairs.

     For some time now, we have been working to port all of the software
     that supports our service to Solaris.  This port is needed since
     Sun is decreasing support for the version of their operating system
     we are currently using (SunOS 4.1).  We have a 1wSolaris machine
     which we are using as the target of our porting effort.  All
     applications must be running successfully on the target machine
     before we wil update the production systems.

     A reminder - if you would like to help the Internet community find
     a resource that you offer, send mail to admin@ds.internic.net and
     we will send information about listing your resource in the
     Directory of Directories.  If you prefer, you can enter information
     about your resource in our WWW suggestion form.  The form can be
     reached through our Directory of Directories Web page at:

     THE US DOMAIN REGISTRY
     ======================

     The US Domain is only registering domain names providing two
     nameservers. We will no longer register direct registrations in the
     form of non-IP hosts, (i.e, UUCP connections requiring MX records),
     or IP hosts requiring A records).  The only A record we will add to
     our zone file is a glue record for a delegation.

     Please contact a local service provider to provide your primary and
     or secondary name service.

     For further information about the US Domain, send a message to:
     US-DOMAIN@ISI.EDU, or browse our WEB page:
