INTERNET MONTHLY REPORTS
------------------------

The purpose of these reports is to communicate to the Internet Research
Group the accomplishments, milestones reached, or problems discovered by
the participating organizations.

     This report is for Internet information purposes only, and is not
     to be quoted in other publications without permission from the
     submitter.

Each organization is expected to submit a 1/2 page report on the first
business day of the month describing the previous month's activities.

These reports should be submitted via network mail to:

     Ann Westine Cooper (Cooper@ISI.EDU)

     NSF Regional reports - To obtain the procedure describing how to
     submit information for the Internet Monthly Report, send an email
     message to mailserv@is.internic.net and put "send imr-procedure" in
     the body of the message (add only that one line; do not put a
     signature).

Requests to be added or deleted from the Internet Monthly report list
should be sent to "imr-request@isi.edu".

     Details on obtaining the current IMR, or back issues, via FTP or
     EMAIL may be obtained by sending an EMAIL message to "rfc-
     info@ISI.EDU" with the message body "help: ways_to_get_imrs".  For
     example:

             To: rfc-info@ISI.EDU

INTERNET PROJECTS
-----------------

ANSNET/NSFNET BACKBONE ENGINEERING
----------------------------------

     Network Status Summary
     ======================

     ANSnet total packet traffic grew by over 5% in April '94.  The
     process of CIDR aggregation continued in April.  A decrease in the
     ANSnet forwarding table growth was observed (1.72%) for the month
     due to the withdrawal of 2,954 class based destinations.

     April Backbone Traffic Statistics
     =================================

     The total inbound packet count for the ANSnet (measured using SNMP
     interface counters) was 58,015,017,839 on T3 ENSS interfaces, up
     2.03% from March.  The total packet count into the network
     including all ENSS serial interfaces was 68,132,330,845 up 4.99%
     from March.

     Router Forwarding Table Statistics
     ==================================

     The maximum number of destinations announced to the ANSnet during
     April was 19,721 up 1.72% from March.  This decrease in the monthly
     forwarding table growth rate is attributed to CIDR aggregation.

     The number of network destinations configured for announcement to
     the ANSnet but were never announced (silent nets) during April was
     10,558.

     BGP-4/CIDR Deployment Status
     ===========================

     The following autonomous systems are currently exchanging routing
     information with ANSnet via the BGP-4 protocol:

     3     MIT
     22    NOSC
     86    SURANet

Internet Monthly Report                                       April 1994


     As of early May '94, we have observed the withdrawal of 2,954 class
     based destinations from the ANSnet router forwarding tables that
     are now represented by 435 configured aggregates.  Among these 37
     configured aggregates:

       398 of these are top-level aggregates (not nested in another
       aggregate).

       184 of these are actively announced to ANSnet.

       162 of these have at least one subnet configured (the other 22
       may be saving the Internet future subnet announcements).

       142 of these have resulted in the withdrawal of at least one
       configured more specific route.

       136 of these have resulted in the withdrawal of 50% of their
       configured more specific routes.

       116 of these have resulted in the withdrawal of most (80%+) of
       their more specific routes.

     For further details on these CIDR aggregates, see
     merit.edu:pub/nsfnet/cidr/nestings.announced for full listings.

     Other gated software changes will be deployed over the next couple
     of months to improve policy processing (required to support some
     advanced forms of proxy aggregation).

     Routing Stability Measured on the T3 Network
     ============================================

     The three different routing stability measurements that have been
     reported on over the past year were based on rcp_routed log file
     entries.  Gated software was deployed at the end of February to
     replace rcp_routed.  These routing stability reports have not yet
     been converted to use gated logging.  No data is available for the
     month of April.  Data collection is expected to resume shortly.

     Notable Outages for April '94
     =============================

     E134 (Boston) suffered an extended outage due to hardware problems
     on 04/02.

     E136 (College Park) suffered an extended outage due to software
     problems on 04/04.

     * DANTE SHAREHOLDING EXPANDED *

     On 25 March 1994, the DANTE Shareholders meeting took place in
     Amsterdam. At the meeting the ownership of the company was formally
     transferred from RARE to the Shareholders. RARE had been the legal
     owner and only shareholder of DANTE in the first year of its
     existence. During the meeting RARE was formally discharged of all
     responsibility for the company, with the new Shareholders
     acknowledging RARE's important role in setting it up. The chairman
     thanked RARE for its support.

     When issuing the Shareholder Certificates to the organisations
     which had signed the final Shareholders Agreement the company
     secretary, Boudewijn Nederkoorn from SURFnet, said: "This is an
     historic occasion which marks a major step forward in pan-European
     service provision for the research community".

Internet Monthly Report                                       April 1994


     The following persons were appointed on the new Board of Directors:
     Klaus Ullmann (DFN, DE) as a Director for a period of three years
     and as Chairman of the Board; Boudewijn Nederkoorn (SURFnet, NL)
     and Fernando Liello (CNUCE, IT) as Directors for a period of three
     years, and Juergen Harms (SWITCH, CH) as a Director for a period of
     two years. The new Board will make a proposal for a fifth Director,
     who is to be approved by the Shareholders. The Operational Unit
     Steering Committee, which was originally set up by potential
     shareholders of DANTE to manage the creation of the company, will
     be wound up as it has now completed its task.

     The organisations which had signed the Shareholders Agreement at
     the time of the meeting were: SWITCH (Switzerland), DFN (Germany),
     HUNGARNET (Hungary), CNUCE (Italy), SURFnet (Netherlands), NORDUnet
     (Nordic countries), FCCN (Portugal), ARNES (Slovenia), HEFC(E) (on
     behalf of the UK). Organisations from other countries, including
     Belgium, Spain and Greece, which had been unable to sign the
     Agreement before the meeting, are still expected to do so.

     * EuropaNET: THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS *

     In co-operation with CEENet, the Central and Eastern European
     Networking Association set up in January 1994, DANTE has prepared a
     plan for the development of international connectivity in Central
     and Eastern Europe. The plan takes account of the financial and
     other support that is likely to be available from ACOnet, NORDUnet
     and the CEC's PHARE Programme. Implementation of the plan, which
     outlines general principles as well as details for individual
     countries, would represent a significant step forwards.  DANTE has
     offered to set up all the interconnections which include EuropaNET
     if the plan goes ahead. The document is available from the DANTE
     gopher server (EuropaNET directory).

     The 2 Mbps line between Amsterdam and Washington (finally) came
     into operation on 17 March 1994. Dai Davies, DANTE general manager,
     commented: "This was an unusually challenging activity and the
     effort required from DANTE to do so is a sad reflection on the
     difficulties that still exist in getting international line
     providers to organise simple things." The line was ordered in
     November 1993 and was originally planned to be operational by
     January 1994.

     Since the beginning of April, EuropaNET is capable of exchanging
     routing information with its peers on the basis of the new version
     of the Border-Gateway-Protocol (BGP-4). Version 3 of the protocol
     does not support Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR), which offers
     routers the possibility to aggregate routing entries. As routing
     tables in the Internet were becoming too big to be handled within a

     router, there was an urgent need to migrate to BGP-4.

     * CALL FOR TENDER MailFLOW *

     An open Call for Tender for the provision MHS-Coordination,
     MailFLOW, has been issued by DANTE. MailFLOW is currently provided
     on behalf of DANTE by SWITCH, the Swiss research network. The
     purpose of the tender is twofold: on the one hand to give other
     providers a chance to step forward and on the other hand to
     introduce a competitive element in the Service provision.

     Tender requirements are available from the DANTE gopher server, in
     the MailFLOW directory (under Applications Services). The deadline
     for submitting proposals is 30 June 1994.

     * HIGH SPEED PROGRESS *

     As reported in the previous "Works", in January DANTE secured
     approval in principle from the EuroCAIRN (European Co-operation for
     Academic and Industrial Research Networking, a EUREKA Project)
     Project Board for a proposal to produce a study report, the target
     of which is to specify information and requirements necessary to
     support funding proposals and the formal procurement of a high-
     speed backbone.

     EuroCAIRN now has enough financial commitments to pay for the
     proposed study report. Preliminary contract negotiations have
     already started with the CEC. DANTE is prepared to start work
     immediately following the next EuroCAIRN meeting if a contract is
     approved.

     * DISCUS, NEW NAME FOR A FAMILIAR SERVICE *

     Last month CONCISE, the information server set up as part of the
     COSINE project, was renamed DISCUS. A new name has been introduced
     to mark the beginning of a new period: in 1994 Level-7 will be
     providing the service on behalf of DANTE.

     The main issue in the Information Services area is to define which
     role DANTE should play in offering pan-European information
     services which are not yet available from other sources (and which
     would be commercially viable). In parallel, the future
     possibilities of DISCUS will be addressed.

     * DANTE GOPHER INSTALLED *

     A first set of information on the company, staff and services is
     now electronically available from the DANTE gopher server

     <gopher.dante.net>, see "Information on DANTE and its activities".
     An important future aim of the information server is to present on
     a regular basis a range of relevant statistics relating to
     EuropaNET.  DANTE is currently looking into the definition and
     production of such statistics.

     * EuropaNET POSTER AVAILABLE FROM DANTE *

     A full-colour poster of the EuropaNET network is now available and
     can be obtained by sending a message to DANTE (dante@dante.org.uk).

     Netstation
     ----------

     The objective of the Netstation project is to demonstrate that both
     I/O and peripheral device control can be effectively accomplished
     by substituting a gigabit LAN for the system bus.  To that end we
     shall bitmap display and camera, and control them via remote
     procedure calls (RPCs).

     High Performance RPC

     Because a network dedicated device has direct access to its own
     network output buffer memory, it can create a stencil of the
     packets that it sends within that memory and be assured that this
     stencil will not overwritten.

     The task of sending successive RPC messages for the display process
     consists of changing only those locations in the stencil that are
     altered from call to call.  These are:

        (1)  Destination addresses, in LAN and IP headers
        (2)  Source and destination UDP ports in the UDP header
        (3)  Packet lengths, in LAN and IP headers
        (4)  Checksums, in LAN and IP header
        (5)  Procedure and program indexes, in the RPC header
     and finally,
        (6) Supply procedure arguments at the end of the stencil

     We showed at the end of March that the techniques developed for
     high- performance RPC based upon this technique produced a level of
     performance at least ten times greater that that offered by the
     standard UNIX stack in a SPARCstation-10.

     We expect that performance obtained in the specialized display and
     camera devices that we are building will perform at least as well,
     and probably, substantially better.

     A question arises.  At what level does the interface to a 'remote'
     display belong?  This project postulates that the coming advances
     in VLSI, when combined with gigabit LAN performance, allow that
     interface to be made very low.  We are replacing the system bus
     with a gigabit network.  Thus we should interface to the display
     much lower than the level used in the X-windows interface.

     An approach which is being considered seriously is to rewrite the
     device dependent portion of the X-windows server code.  In
     particular, to rewrite the Pixblit code, so that its rasterop
     procedure calls are transformed into RPCs that are sent across the
     ATOMIC network to the display device for execution.

     In this approach, no windowing system assumed by the network
     display device whatsoever.  The display is only required to
     implement a battery of RPCs.  The virtual interface presented to
     the network will initially be a very simple one.

     Subsequent to this, experimentation with multiple JPEG streams will
     occur.  JPEG data may not use an RPC model for data delivery.  This
     remains to be determined.

     At a later stage it will be necessary to implement security and
     access restrictions to the display device.

     Display Network Virtual Device

     Bruce Parham, an EE formerly with Jet Propulsion Laboratory, was
     hired to design the display and camera network virtual devices.

     The broad design outlines are to develop a display that allows two
     JPEG streams plus device and raster graphics commands to arrive
     over an ATOMIC gigabit LAN port.  The display should be capable of
     rendering two NTSC video windows in real-time.  To achieve this the
     display will include a LANai gigabit network interface, a graphics
     DSP, and JPEG chips.

     The design of a 1280x1024 24-bit color CRT display is held hostage
     by the pixel rate.  Modern computer CRT displays are progressively
     scanned.  Human factors engineering decrees that refresh rate must
     be at least 60 frame/sec.  Currently, a rate somewhat higher, in
     the low 70s, is favored to eliminate all trace of image flicker.  A
     rate of 72 frame/sec results in a pixel rate of approximately 90
     Mpels/sec, or 11 ns/pel.



Cooper                                                         [Page 19]

Internet Monthly Report                                       April 1994


     The principal design problem is therefore one of memory
     organization.  If it is desired to allow the frame buffer to be
     updated by real-time video sources, the frame buffer memory
     bandwidth must approximate twice that required by refresh.  An
     analysis of available memory parts and organizations is underway to
     determine what the most cost effective current engineering solution
     to this is.

     Previously, a good choice for the video DSP would have been the TMS
     32040 from Texas Instruments, which contained a video/VRAM refresh
     controller and a graphics-oriented CPU.  Unfortunately, within the
     last month it has been withdrawn from support.

     Its replacement is the TMS320C8x.  This is a multi-DSP 2 GOPs
     processing chip that is designed to carry out JPEG or MPEG-II
     decode in real-time.  At $1500/part and not yet truly available, it
     is tantalizing, but inappropriate.  This is primarily because it
     does not come with publicly available JPEG/MPEG.  The programming
     resources required to embed those algorithms is outside the current
     scope of the NAAAN contract.

     This is an issue that deserves some consideration at a higher
     level.  If this is indeed a appropriately powerful, fixing on a
     standard DSP/video chip, and making publicly available a standard
     suite of JPEG/MPEG software for it, could speed the spread of HDS
     hardware development and so its applications.

     We have decided to replace the TMS 34020 with two chips: A TMS
     320C40 (which is a similarly numbered chip - but quite different
     internally) and a graphics controller chip that is yet to be
     determined.  The 320C40 is a super-scalar DSP with dual-bus
     support.  It promises to be endlessly fascinating to program, that
     is, if we can ever figure out why we need to use parallel
     multiply/add/index instructions.

     Seriously though, its dual-bus support provides a Harvard
     architecture, allowing dedication of one bus to data transfer.
     That bus will be used largely to transfer network packets in/out of
     320C40 memory, provide compressed JPEG input to the CL560 chip
     FIFOs, and to perform frame-buffer rasterop update.

     Details of the display design will be made available in subsequent
     reports.

     Merit Network's MichNet Seminar, enthusiastically received by
     member and affiliate organizations at its introduction in Ann Arbor
     in late February, will be offered on the campus of Central Michigan
     University in Mt. Pleasant on 19 May.  Designed primarily with new
     affiliate needs in mind, topics include an overview of the
     Internet; MichNet and Merit Services; Merit's Cruise of the
     Internet; and Internet tools, including FTP, Gopher and WWW.

     Merit held a series of Internet Briefings and Open Houses for
     Michigan's K-12 communities in March and April.  The eight, day-
     long Internet Briefings hosted throughout the state by MichNet
     member and affiliate institutions, were planned to familiarize
     teachers and administrators with the benefits of direct Internet
     access and to provide details on new funding opportunities.  With
     the settlement of the "Michigan Bell Rebate Case," more than $26
     million is available for educational telecommunications projects.
     The governor-appointed Michigan Council on Telecommunications
     Services for Public Education issued a "Request for Pre-Proposal,"
     inviting proposals for allocating approximately $9 million of the
     total funds, and encouraging collaborative efforts between groups
     of organizations.  Merit's increased K-12 outreach initiatives were
     designed to help schools respond to the "Request for Pre-Proposal,"
     enhancing the opportunity to expand programs already developed in
     partnership with the Michigan schools.

     Merit is working with the Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME)
     on the Cooperative Network for Dual Use Information Technologies
     (CoNDUIT) project.  Funded by a $24.3 million Technology
     Reinvestment Program grant, the new program aims to provide small
     manufacturing businesses with training using network
     infrastructure.  CoNDUIT will develop a network that will allow
     full implementation of teleconferencing, remote library access, and
     daily communication among business and educational facilities.  A
     central resource for the network will be an Industry NIC (I-NIC),
     providing business with human and online support systems for
     understanding and using network technologies.  Multi-media training
     will be a significant I-NIC offering.  Merit is also participating
     in the Michigan Industrial Extension Partnership, a 1993 TRP award
     made to Michigan State University to provide network services to
     industrial extension agents in the state.

MERIT/NSFNET ENGINEERING
------------------------

     The report summarizes recent activities of Merit's NSFNET Project
     Internet Engineering and Network Management groups.

     Routing Registry
     ----------------

     Merit is happy to announce the Merit Routing Registry.  Whereas
     Merit designed and manages the PRDB (Policy Routing Data Base) for
     the NSFNET service, RIPE pioneered a policy routing registry for
     the European community. The RIPE Routing Registry is based on the
     document, RIPE-81. With RIPE's collaboration, Merit installed
     RIPE-81 software and then extended the policy descriptions in order
     to realize more complex policies. The Merit Routing Registry will
     be a companion registry to the RIPE Routing Registry and is
     intended to serve the community that is not served by RIPE.

     This is a new service and we consider ourselves still in the beta
     phase. Registrations may be basic policy descriptions defined in
     RIPE-81 or complex routing policy descriptions defined in the
     Extended Policy Syntax document by Chen, Gerich, Joncheray, and Yu.
     The Extended Policy Syntax document may be found on
     rrdb.merit.edu:pub/meritrr/policy_syntax.txt. Documentation for
     using the MeritRR can be found on rrdb.merit.edu:pub/meritrr.

     Merit and RIPE anticipate that the combined registries will provide
     a more comprehensive picture of the routing interactions in the
     Internet.  We are working together to allow the two registries to
     appear like one virtual registry to the various tools that are
     developed.  We welcome your comments on all aspects of this
     project.  For more information, please respond to
     rradmin@rrdb.merit.edu.

     Several new tools are also available for anonymous ftp from
     rrdb.merit.edu:/pub/meritrr and include:

     -astrace.tar.Z:  The new prtraceroute to use with the NARR registry
     -aggrwalk.tar.Z: A tool to expand aggregates into sub components
     -alc.tar.Z:      The Routing Policy Server code

     - "Fake ASs" are no longer required for peers which need attach to
        AS690 in more than one place.  A new syntax "metric:AS(NSS)" has
        been created to support this, for use in the PRDB AS-metric
        lists.  All PRDB reports (including whois and ftpable reports)
        will soon include this syntax;  it will soon be accepted on
        NACRs as well.

     - A new "NOCONFIG" option has been added.  This option allows nets
        to be registered in the PRDB without passing knowledge of those
        specific nets on to the Gated config files and the backbone
        routers.  The initial use of this feature has been to suppress
        the configuration of more-specific-subnets of announced
        aggregates.

     - The "whois -h prdb.merit.edu 'aggchk <aggregate>'" command has
        been modified to include information about whether the
        aggregates and their more-specific subnets are being announced.
        Flags in the left of the report mark currently-announced nets
        with "+", never-announced nets with " ", and nets that have been
        withdrawn N days ago with a the number N.  Nets which have had
        the "NOCONFIGURE" option are marked with the flag "U";  Proxy
        nets are marked with "P".

     - Two new temporary reports are available on
        merit.edu:pub/nsfnet/cidr.  "nestings.announced" lists all
        aggregates registered in the PRDB, along with their more-
        specific-subnets and their offnet status (see above).
        "cidr_savings" gives a summary of the same information by
        aggregate.

     - Proxy aggregation at a single ENSS is currently supported in the
        PRDB;  final testing of the feature is awaiting deployment of
        GateD Proxy code.

     - A new "flags" field has been added to the output of "whois -h
        prdb.merit.edu <net>".  This "flags" field shows the status of
        the "NOCONFIG" and "Proxy" flags, and will hold future flag
        values.

     CIDR Progress
     -------------

     IE staff are working with the remaining non-CIDR compatible NSFNET
     regional networks to upgrade to BGP4, to begin announcing CIDR
     aggregates, and to withdraw specific routes covered by those
     aggregates.  The approximately 18,450 routes currently announced
     include 276 aggregates and 3,275 more specific routes have been
     withdrawn from routing announcement.  Merit's offnet reports

     IDRP Project
     ------------

     Continued development and testing have followed release of version
     1.0 of the IDRP software. Merit's Inter-Domain Routing Policy
     Project for the US-FAA is an implementation of OSI-IDRP for gated.
     A generic PATRICIA trie implementation supports multiple
     independent tries of several critical data structures including
     RDIs.

     The software is available for anonymous ftp from:
     merit.edu:pub/iso/idrp/faa/gated-idrp.0.9.6.tar.Z

     K-12 Domain Count
     -----------------

     An analysis was performed for NSF on the number of K-12 names in
     the US domain. The listing of was prepared by walking the US DNS
     tree and is available for anonymous ftp from
     twain.merit.edu:pub/k12.uniq.Z

NORTHWESTNET
------------

     In mid-April, the User Services group provided three Internet
     classes for 8 staff members from the King County Library System.
     They will take the information they have learned in these classes
     and apply it to the development of Internet services within their
     organization.  The King County Library System serves over 40 sites
     in the Puget Sound region.

     This was also a busy month for the User Services Committee. On
     April 21, Jan Eveleth (director of User Services at NorthWestNet)
     moderated the monthly teleconference discussion, "Exploring Legal
     Issues on the Internet." As always, this topic produced spirited
     discussion. The following week, regional committee meetings were
     held at the Oregon Historical Society in Portland, Oregon and at
     The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington.  The discussion
     topic, "Coping with Diversity," and agenda were duplicated at each
     meeting. Participants highlighted many areas in which diversity
     affects their work in supporting the Internet. Where diversity has
     created challenges, the group shared their ideas and experiences.

     Upcoming:

     The NorthWestNet training facility will open its doors for the
     first in a series of scheduled Internet classes in May and June.
     These for-fee classes are open to the public as well as
     NorthWestNet member organizations. Each three hour class will
     combine lecture, demonstration, and hands-on lessons exploring the
     Internet and accessing online resources and services. Subjects
     include introduction to the Internet, electronic mail, FTP, Telnet,
     and Gopher. For more information, send mail to training@nwnet.net
     or call our offices at (206) 562-3000.

UCL
----

     Replacement of the (10-30% lossy) Ethernet at ULCC by a Hub means
     that our International Internet Access is radically improved,
     especially for Mbone events.

     We helped Cambridge University to setup the mbone casting of their
     weekly saeminar series.

     Crowcroft proposed a modest modification to IP to meet the current
     IPng requirements, called I PING, that permits mutual use of
     routers by IP and IPng. It was proposed as a trivial strawman to
     measure and burn other proposals against, rather than a serious
     candidate.

     UCL Hosted the SIGCOMM 94 Program Committee meeting, whose
     deliberations will be forthcoming around now.
