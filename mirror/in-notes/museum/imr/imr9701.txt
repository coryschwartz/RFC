INTERNET MONTHLY REPORTS
------------------------

The purpose of these reports is to communicate to the Internet Research
Group the accomplishments, milestones reached, or problems discovered by
the participating organizations.

Each organization is expected to submit a 1/2 page report on the first
business day of the month describing the previous month's activities.
These reports should be submitted via network mail to "IMR-ED@ISI.EDU".

The Internet Monthly Report mailing list is now managed by MajorDomo at
ISI.EDU.  The announcements of new issues on the Internet Monthly Report
are sent to the IETF-Announce list and to this IMR list.

Requests to be ADDED or DELETED from the Internet Monthly report list
should be sent to "majordomo@isi.edu" with the message body either
"subscribe imr" or "unsubscribe imr".

Details on obtaining the current IMR, or back issues, via FTP or EMAIL
may be obtained by sending an EMAIL message to "rfc-info@ISI.EDU" with
the message body "help: ways_to_get_imrs".  For example:

     INTERNIC DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES

     In December we made the Academic Guide to the Internet available
     on our servers.  The Guide locates and describes Internet
     resources that are of particular interest to the research and
     academic communities.  The Guide also allows for the community to
     rate the resources listed.  In the Community Commentary section,
     users may express their opinion of the academic value of a site.
     The scores are tallied and posted with the description of the
     resource.

     The major categories covered by the Guide are primarily
     science-oriented.  They include

       + Biological Sciences

       + Computer and Information Sciences

       + Education and Human Sciences

       + Engineering

       + Geosciences

       + Mathematical and Physical Sciences

       + Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences

     The Guide was designed and developed by Aldea Communications for
     the InterNIC.  It can be reached via:

              http://ds.internic.net/aldea/attframes2.html

     The data from the Academic Guide are indexed in Harvest.

     The MBONE recordings of the December IETF meeting (in San Jose)
     are now available in RealAudio(TM) format, which can be accessed
     directly from the web.  The converted recordings are available
     via the URL:

                  http://ds0.internic.net/mbone/37th/

     The latest version of the Netfind seed database has over 1 million
     entries.

     A reminder - if you would like to help the Internet community find
     a resource that you offer, send mail to admin@ds.internic.net and
     we will send information about listing your resource in the
     Directory of Directories.  If you prefer, you can enter
     information about your resource in our WWW suggestion form.  The
     form can be reached through our Directory of Directories Web page

     THE US DOMAIN REGISTRY
     ======================

     The US Domain has an online registration form available at
     http://www.isi.edu/us-domain.

     The US Domain administrator no longer makes direct registrations of
     hosts, and only makes delegations of third or fourth level domain
     names (such as localities).

Internet Monthly Report                                     January 1997


     Some of the processing of the requests to the third level domain
     name is now automated. In particular, most requests to register
     names in localities already delegated are automatically forwarded
     to the administrator of that locality.

     A new policy has been added regarding the charges for the domain
     name passed on during delegation.  The administrator of the
     locality has to notify one year in advance before charging for
     those domains.

     US DOMAIN ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION
     ====================================

             EMAIL/FAX             2761

     OTHER US DOMAIN MESSAGES include referrals to other subdomains or
     to/from the InterNic, phone calls, modifications, application
     requests, discussion and clarification of the requests, questions
     about names, resolving technical problems with zone files and name
     servers, and whois listings.

MERIT INTERNET ENGINEERING
--------------------------

     This report summarizes January 1997 activities of Merit's Internet
     Engineering group on behalf of the Routing Arbiter (RA) service and
     other projects.

     Merit is pleased to announce that MAE-East Route Server operations
     have successfully transitioned to the new Route Server Next
     Generation (RSNG) project.  Two new Sun Ultras running Solaris are
     now installed at the site.  Preparation for deployment of the new
     Route Servers began in October 1996, when Bill Norton, Jake Khuon,
     Abha Ahuja, and Brad Robertson formed a focused team to plan the
     transition.  To ensure continued reliability of the new systems,
     the exchange point out-of-band equipment has been largely
     redesigned.  Other new Route Server systems to be deployed in pairs
     at the exchange points include DEC Alphas running Digital Unix and
     additional Sun Ultras.

     The RSNG project makes it possible for exchange point operators to
     purchase Route Server services from Merit.  RSNG is one of three
     activities that had been part of the Routing Arbiter project, and
     are now seeking support as independent activities.  NSF recommended
     the move to Route Server commercialization in August 1996 after its
     24-month review of the RA project, noting that the Route Servers
     had shown that multiple network providers can work well together in
     a competitive marketplace.  To date, the MAE-East and AADS NAPs,
     MAE-West, the Digital Internet Exchange in Palo Alto, and the
     Atlanta-NAP have agreed to offer Route Server services through
     RSNG.  Transition to new Route Server operations is expected to be
     completed in the first quarter of 1997.  For more information about
     RSNG, see:

     Additional Merit activities seeking independent funding include:

       - Statistical research and tool development.  Following NSF's
          recommendation that these projects be pursued separately from the
          Routing Arbiter activity, a proposal was submitted to NSF for
          support for a new Internet Performance Measurement and Analysis
          project. For more information, see:

             http://www.merit.edu/ipma/

       - Support for the North American Network Operators Group is also
          under proposal to NSF as a service independent of the Routing
          Arbiter.

     Other key Merit activities continue to be supported by the National
     Science Foundation as part of the Routing Arbiter project.  These
     include the Routing Arbiter Database, tools for the RADB and the
     Internet Routing Registry, and leading-edge routing for advanced
     networking.

     Jerry Winters attended the 26th RIPE meeting in Amsterdam, where he gave
     a presentation titled "Internet Routing Instability" to the Routing
     Working Group, and participated in sessions of the Database Working
     Group.

The 26th RIPE Meeting

   The 26th RIPE Meeting was held in January 1997 in Amsterdam, The
   Netherlands.  Approximately 185 people attended.  There were six
   working groups, two BOFs, and numerous open plenary sessions with
   presentations and reports.

1)  Local IR Working Group - Mike Norris

Report form the RIPE NCC - Mirjan Kuehne

   EU Internet Growth (Hostcount) 3,600,000 - didn't make four million,
   but close.

   Staffing developments since the last RIPE meetings - two more
   hostmasters have started (one from Ireland and one from Norway).  The
   RIPE NCC staffing now has:

         - 6 FTE staff
         - 1 part time staff
         - 1 manager

   RIPE NCC Work Load:

         - wait queue is 0!
         - response time is one day
         - enough staff now and new staff, so not overworked as much
           and response time has improved

   Staff Training:

         - more inaddr staff
         - requesting tracking system

   Activities

         - document revision
         - preparation for Internet Quality Control

Report of the 26th RIPE Meetings


         - preparation for auditing and monitoring
         - local IR training courses

   Plans for the coming quarter

         - Training - more classes are planned, including classes on
           Internet Quality Control, auditing and monitoring
         - HTMLizing the Training Materials.

   Mike mentioned other registries this group might be interested in
   looking into: http://www.boardwatch.com/isp.  This group researched
   ISPs in the United States - might want to look at this and compare.

Registries Report - Daniel Karrenberg

   The RIPE NCC still maintains a good working relationship with the
   APNIC and InterNIC.  They will meet next week in Hong Kong at the
   APRICOT conference.

   He then reported on ARIN (American Registry for Internet Numbers -
   URL: http://www.arin.net).  SAIC/Network Solutions, Inc. (NSI) will
   let go of the InterNIC's registration.  The ARIN is currently in
   development.  It will be a not for profit company.  It will be
   supported by the ISPs.  Similar to the RIPE NCC structure.  This
   development is significant now that all three regional registries are
   operating on the same principal.  It makes it a very strong industry
   self regulation and more formalized.

   The RIPE is separating from TERENA (Trans European Research and
   Education Networking Association) on 1 January 1998.  Must formalize
   this, too.  Also, what does that mean for IANA?  Shouldn't it be
   reorganized?  Formalize it also?

   In regards to IP Address Assignments, there is a new group being
   formed in the IETF, the IRE (PAGAN) Working Group.  Joyce Reynolds
   reported on this in her plenary talk on, "IETF Report" (see Appendix
   A).

   The discussion shifted to the use of the Class A address space that
   are available.  An RFC was published (RFC 2036).  It is Bill
   Manning's document on Class A experiment results.  Daniel asked the
   Local IR WG what should he obtain from the IANA - another /8 or get
   something from the Class A space??  Any interest in monitoring the
   use of Class Bs?  Also, any interest in 192.* reclamation?

Report of the 26th RIPE Meetings


2)  IPv6 Working Group - Thomas Trede

   Thomas Trede became the new chair since RIPE 25.  Geert-Jan de Groot
   and Francis Dupont will be co-chairs of this group.

   A report was provided by Francis Dupont on current 6Bone
   connectivity:

      - 6bone is a network for testing IPv6
      - there are only few sites in France, Denmark and Japan
      - a slide with the current 6bone topology was displayed
        (version 43, December 1996)
      - this topology will be replaced by a new one (version 44, January
        1997)  the picture can be found at:
        http://www-6bone.lbl.gov/6bone/6bone-drawing.html

   Geert-Jan reported on the developments of the new IP routing
   protocols:

      - initial intent of 6bone was to help migrating into IPv6
      - not happening currently, just testing
      - originally set up with static routes
      - this is not practical anymore
      - maybe use RIP2
      - maybe new EGP soon?

           IGP                             EGP
           ---                             ---

   RIP2                                    IDRP (probably not initially)
   OSPF (no implementation yet)            M-BGP (multiprotocol BGP)
   IS-IS (       "            )            BGP5

   The AS number space can be made larger by BGP enhancements.  BGP5 is
   intended to do this do this.

   A discussion ensued with the comment that if more than 64k ASes used,
   BGP also will also need to support this.  A question arose on how
   could you multihome a customer without using an additional AS?
   Geert-Jan provided a brief summary of possible ways how to multihome
   a customer to the same ISP (not to multiple ISPs):

      - use real AS
      - use private AS (RFC1930)
      - use 1 AS for all customers that multihome to you (John Stewart's
        proposal)

Report of the 26th RIPE Meetings


   The real problem is multihoming to different ISPs.  One possible
   solution: 8+8 proposal from Mike O'Dell.  But, why is IDRP not pushed
   forward anymore (in favor of BGP)?  Geert-Jan responded that people
   are afraid of change and BGP is a known, established protocol.

   Geert-Jan reported on developments at the San Jose IETF last
   December:

      - documents that moved forward to proposed standards
      - default hop limit (TTL) discussed: 64? or 255?
      - IPv6 on token ring
      - small changes in the tunneling document
      - University of New Hampshire made operability tests:
        - 2/3 got neighbor discovery right this time
        - only 1/4 of the implementations had serious problems
      - Mike O'Dell's 8+8 proposal
      - 6bone will become and official IETF WG

   News about implementations

      - Some manufactures working on it
      - new alpha version in Singapour
      - INRIA published new linux version
      - IBM
      - Cisco (not official yet)
      - Novell (new IPv6 version for IPX)
      - BayNetworks is also working on it
      - first release mid 1997
      - available for testing now

   An overview was presented of the 8+8 proposals from Mike O'Dell and
   Masataka Ohta.  (Slides are available at:
   ftp://ftp.ripe.net/ripe/presentations/ripe-m-25-gl-8+8.ps)

   There will be a meeting about 8+8 soon. Shall RIPE members attend?
   Daniel stated that it is difficult to form a RIPE opinion after this
   short tutorial.  However, it should be pursued, as it could help
   scaling.  Yet, he doesn't think that 8+8 proposal introduces much
   additional delay in the IPv6 deployment, it mainly discusses issues
   that aren't specified yet.  The general opinion of this group is to
   wait for a new proposal.  The RIPE is not a standards making body
   (the IETF is), but RIPE can take a message to the 8+8 meeting from
   the RIPE IPv6 WG.

   Daniel asked this group if people want provider based IPv6 addresses
   now?

Report of the 26th RIPE Meetings


3)  Database Working Group - Wilfred Woeber

   Not going through the action items - do that in the plenary - deal
   with the technical content in this session.

Presentation by David Kessens - RIDE

   Registry Information Database Exchange Formats (RIDE).  Why do we
   need RIDE (i.e., a standard exchange between registries)?  There is a
   trend to see more registries everywhere.  At the same time, different
   registries use different formats.  The idea is to keep their own
   databases and technologies, but use an exchange.

      - How to succeed this time?  Keep it simple, no political
        problems, and everybody can use their own format.

      - What will RIDE do?  Define which data we want to exchange and
        what we will call the data.  For example, auth-num AS226 translates
        to: dataterm `ASN' has a value of `AS226'.

      - Define standardized data formats for Internet Registries (IP
        routing, domain registries).

      - Define how one can access the data (HTTP, FTP, other...).
        There are many possibilities.

      - Define how one can find the data.

   Eventually, define a distribution system to access and modify data.
   But first, right now, just keep it simple.  Majordomo email list:
   ride-request@isi.edu, with: subscribe ride.  Web site:
   www.isi.edu/~davidk/ride

   What is the timeframe?  Will there be an IETF WG chartered?  David
   stated that this will happen within a year.  See the web pages for
   updates.

Report of the 26th RIPE Meetings


RIPE Database Inconsistencies - Carol Orange

   Student Project on database inconsistencies was initiated, with input
   provided RIPE NCC contributors: Daniel, Ambrose MaGee, and Carol via
   a mid October 1996 staff survey.

   Taxonomy of Inconsistencies:

           -garbage in person/role entities
           -invalid InterNIC's nic-handles (auto1)
           -non-existent object references
           -multiple person objects (with different NIC handles,
            with and without NIC handles
           -Role references in admic-c

   Person Objects - What's in there:

           -Person Objects                 99637
           -With NIC Handle                55479
           -Never referenced in database   16600
           -Names occurring two times       3398
           -Objects Involved                8696

   References/Roles to Persons (graphic chart shown)

   What's found of 240231 objects:

            - 101499 person/role objects
            - 333103 references to person/role

   References were found:

            - 134467 by name
            - 145341 NIC handle
            - 53295 not found (15% can't be found)

   What in the 53295 references?

            - 29826 - "see remarks"
            - 7798 - "not maintained"
            - 7471 - "non existent person/role"
            - 7123 - "-"
            -  293 - telephone numbers
            -  280 - email addresses

Report of the 26th RIPE Meetings


   Constraints:

            - Internal (object) = syntactic, semantic
            - External (object) = referential, inter object

   Enforcement or Input:

            - Internal - input checks
            - External - checks
            - DNS (validity of data)

   1)  Case Study - Suppose we decide the NIC handle is a unique key for
   person/role?  Input - enforce this - give somebody a unique RIPE NIC
   handle, references to a person/role.  Check the existence of it -
   what about non-RIPE handles?  Input to local IRs if this is important
   or a good/bad idea to them??  It is currently an open issue.

   2)  Case Study - cleanup - the data is yours!  If the RIPE NCC can't
   modify, who does?  70% have no maintainer, 41% no email, 84% no
   modify.

   Reference issues:

            - 140150 of 328585 have NIC handles
            - What to do about the 188435?

RIPE Database Update - Carol Orange

   New documentation, statistics, open issues and plans.  RIPE-153 is a
   new document produced by Ambrose MaGee.  Available via the RIPE
   database (give URL: www.ripe.net/docs/ripe-153.html).

4)  RIPE Plenary - Rob Blokzijl

   At the opening of this plenary, Rob announced the new addition of an
   attendance fee for these meetings.  The last 18 of 25 RIPE meetings
   were paid by NIKHEF.  Rob has agreed to be the RIPE chair for another
   two years.  He noted that the RIPE community is saddened by the
   passing of Phil Jones this last December to cancer.  Phil was a long
   time advocate of RIPE.  The RIPE 25 minutes were approved, and
   outstanding action items were gone over.

RIPE NCC Ticketing System (RTT) - Maldwyn Morris

   Maldwyn reported on the RIPE NCC's RTT.  It is a system for taking,
   passing messages to the hostmasters - passing information on in the
   end to the local ISPs.  RFC 1297, "NOC Internal Integrated Trouble
   Ticket System Functional Specification Wishlist ("NOC TT
   REQUIREMENTS") was the reference.  The specific requirements are
   bsd/SUNOS, mh mail-based, source provided and well supported.  Other
   reasons for using RTT - .sit files.

   The RIPE NCC Hostmasters were trained on RTT, including maintenance
   skills.  As of last August there were 4000 tickets and 20000 messages
   in the system.  The next plan is to add a user interface system.

TERENA Web Caching Project - John Martin

   There is a new TERENA project called, CHOICE (Co-operative
   Hierarchical Object Indexing and Caching for Europe).  Why CHOICE?

   There are two related projects

   1) CHOC (Co-op Hierarchical Object Caching).
      CHOC Objective's include to promote the deployment of
      caching.

   2) NLANR.  It is U.S. NSF funded.
      CHOC is linking with this initiative, and coordinating with
      other caching projects in Europe (e.g., DESIRE, etc.).

   One of the CHOC activities is to establish a TERENA task force, and
   the creation and maintenance of documentation.  They are NOT
   concerned about configuration of software and hardware, as they
   cannot determine a country/networking caching policy for them.  The
   email list is: tf-cache@terena.nl.  There are approximately 250
   people currently on the emailing list.  The first meeting was
   September 26, 1996.  The next meeting was held on January 23, 1997.
   You may join in via the mailing list.

TERENA Report on the European CERT (SIRCE) - Don Stikvoort

   SIRCE = Security Incident Response Coordination for Europe

   Europe has ~25% of all Internet hosts.  There are hundreds of
   registered security incidents per year.  There are twelve fully
   established "CERTS" in Europe.  Ten more are to be established.
   Currently, DARPA pays for their coordination.

   1988    Internet Worm
   1990    FIRST: Forum of CERTS
           (first European CERT - SPAN in France)
   1993    Birth of EuroCERT idea
   1994    RARE CERT Task Force
           (report ConCERT-in-E, inCERT)
   1995    Task Forces CERTS in Europe
   1996    Budapest JENC - TAG and SIRCE

   TAG (Technical Advisory Group) was created last summer by the JENC
   (Joint European Networking Conference) on advice of the CERTS in
   Europe.  TAG did a comparison with experts from the field and sent
   out a proposal solicitation for a pilot project.  The results were
   three proposals.  One was withdrawn, the remaining two met all their
   demands.

   The UKERNA/DANTE proposal ranked first.  The UKERNA/DANTE mix was
   desirable because UKERNA brings in operational experience.  JANET-
   CERT runs the operations (Dennis Jackson, et. al.)

   The next sept of the TAG is to secure funding for this pilot project.
   DARPA is currently paying right now, but not much longer.  SIRCE
   should be a pilot for 30 months, but offer stable service before
   that.  It should have established and trusted services after that
   time period.

Report of the 26th RIPE Meetings


RIPE Open Discussion on the IAHC and its Draft Proposal

   Rob stated that the aim of this discussion is to obtain input from
   the RIPE attendees to give to the IAHC (Internet International Ad Hoc
   Committee).  URL: http://www.iahc.org.

   The deadline the IAHC placed for comments is right during the RIPE
   meetings and the APRICOT meetings the week after!  Meanwhile, the
   IAHC needs the input.  Some very interesting discussion and opinions
   ensued from the RIPE meeting attendees about the IAHC in this
   session.  The general consensus is that this group is NOT happy with
   the IAHC as a body and the draft proposal they have out.

   Rob Blokzijl's personal view, not as Chair of RIPE speaking about the
   draft:

   1) No where in the draft proposal is there a clear statement of
      problems to be solved.  Solutions are presented to problems that
      are not presented very well.

   2) .com domain contention of names.  The result is to create
      additional domains.  Why try to create more?  How does that solve
      anything?

   3) Trademark issues/Legislation.

   4) The draft at the very end is not a new idea.  A "user-friendly"
      directory service is not new!

   There are interesting new concepts, and it takes care of U.S. centric
   competition.  Picked by lottery is a new concept.

Christopher Wilkinson of the EC (European Community)

   Christopher Wilkinson of the EC Telecommunications Directorate was at
   this meeting and gave a brief talk about the EC's interested in the
   IAHC and its activities.  He stated he was at the RIPE meetings
   specifically on a fact finding mission of how the RIPE community felt
   about IAHC.  He said he wanted to get a reading on what Europeans
   should do about this.

   Why is the EC interested?  The Internet growth and development is #3
   or #4 of the EC's top level agenda.  He stated that when the EC read
   the IAHC draft, they saw the following that "stuck out":

Report of the 26th RIPE Meetings


   - lack of European participation (token representation of Australia
     and Japan).  He met with Bob Shaw and Albert Tramposch (IAHC
     members) and he stated to this group that Shaw and Tramposch agree
     with this.

   - problem with trademarks

   - scalibility

   - new registries and how they should be allocated

   He stated that he would be taking careful notes of the RIPE comments
   and take them back to the EC.  The EC wants to the use the RIPE input
   to use in the EC response to the IAHC.

   If the IAHC does set up an international board of trustees, is that
   something Europe wants?  Or take a separate view?  If IAHC goes ahead
   with the "licensing" of new iTLD registries, what will these new
   organization look like?

   Rob stated that he felt that this is primarily a U.S. problem.  Don't
   export it to Europe.  Christopher Wilkinson stated that he met with
   the two IAHC members (Shaw and Tramposch) last Friday, January 17th
   at an EC meeting.

   Frode Greisen, Internet Society (ISOC) Trustee, responded to Rob's
   statements, since ISOC pushed Don Heath (President of the Internet
   Society) to form IAHC.  He mentioned that Jon Postel proposed this
   concept first.  There is a genuine thread of fragmentation of the
   Internet (AlterNIC, as an example).  Is this an American problem
   (impatient with NSI and the "money making machine")?  It is a smaller
   problem than the bigger picture.  Consider making options for
   improvement.  Competition may be able to solve some of these problems
   (especially in the telecommunications field).  Look more positively
   about this re-regulation.  Internet has been able to grow.  Be
   careful to say how governments need to control.

   Rob stated that lumping together a wide range of problems, and just
   say competition will solve it and take it step by step in a certain
   timeframe is not optimistic.  The IAHC is trying to do everything at
   the same time.  This is very scary with proposed timeframe.  It
   created a technical solution to legal problems.  Don't try and make
   our technology a solution to solve problems the telephone system
   solved 30-40 years ago.

   Other comments by the group included, that Internet engineering
   doesn't have a DNS problem, so don't expect Internet engineers to
   solve the problems that whatever mankind has had!  In regards to the

Report of the 26th RIPE Meetings


   crisis of Directory Services and tools, they are archaic.  Those
   protocols are outdated today.  The need is to build those tools in
   order for people to come.  Mike Norris mentioned that this is not
   just a "telephone" move problem.

   The IAHC is proposing an "interim" solution.  There is a pressing
   need for interim solutions in the U.S., NOT Europe.  Energy spent on
   this effort leaves no strength left to develop Directory Services.
   In the interim, the IAHC will create seven new domains. One year form
   now, they will need 7 more new domains!

   What is the IAHC trying to solve?  The problems are US centric.  They
   should focus on the .US domain, not global problem solving.

   The CORE (Council of Registrars).  RIPE is a potential candidate in
   Europe.  RIPE cannot afford to stay out of this process any longer,
   as part of the new organization of CORE is the gTLD registries.
   There is a discrepancy.  If Europe tells the IAHC, "don't do it"
   (creating new registries) and if they don't follow the
   recommendation, then RIPE should be at the CORE table if they go on
   with their plans. RIPE should be in on the process.

   There should be push back at the IAHC, as RIPE, APNIC, etc., not
   represented.  The IAHC is too lawyer top heavy.  The whole thing
   should be pushed back and the whole issue revisited.  They will not
   be implementors nor the administrators of this decision.  Send it
   back.

RIPE NCC report (see Registries report, section 1) - Daniel Karrenberg

   Regarding the CERTS and proposals to TAG.  RIPE-149 citation,
   proposal is RIPE-150. (See URL: www.ripe.net/docs/)

   - Security issues are important, but not important enough to spend
     money on it.  The solicitation for proposals was all too rushed.

   - In 1997 there is a revised (RIPE-144) activity plan.  Registration
     services are a serious effort that is going on with quality control
     this year.

   - Audit control (auditing of local registries for inconsistencies)
     (see RIPE Databases Inconsistencies, section 3 )

   - More new activities planned (more global routing, tracking)

Report of the 26th RIPE Meetings


   - Plan to double staff by the end of 1997 of up to 32 people.  Will
     move the NCC from NIKHEF into center of Amsterdam.  The move will
     take place in April/May 1997.  Moving because of space problems.
     NIKHEF has been very accommodating, but options were not viable.

   - New address - Singel #258 - to the left of the Main Post Office.
     There are about 40 pubs in the area :-)

   The RIPE will also separate from TERENA.  RIPE will be more
   responsible for their finances.  In regards to the TERENA split, the
   NCC's budget is bigger than TERENA's at this point in time.  A case
   of the tail wagging the dog situation.  The split will take place on
   January 1st, 1998.

The Requests for Comments (RFCs) are a series of notes, started in
1969, about the Internet (originally the ARPANET). The notes discuss
many aspects of computing and computer communication focusing in
networking protocols, procedures, programs, and concepts, but also
including meeting notes, opinion, and sometimes humor. The
specification documents of the Internet protocol suite, as defined by
the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and its steering group (the
IESG), are published as RFCs.

RFCs-to-be are edited by the RFC Editor.  RFCs enter the RFC Editor's
work queue either by an action of the IESG or by independent
submission.  Most independent submissions are referred to the IESG to
check for overlap with IETF work.  The IESG might put a hold on a
document to gather more input from its members.  The wait for an RFC
to be published varies as there can be unforeseen complications
(typically editorial matters that need clarification from the author).
Documents can be removed from the publication queue if they are found
to be insufficient or incorrect or if the IESG asks the author to join
work already in progress in the IETF.
