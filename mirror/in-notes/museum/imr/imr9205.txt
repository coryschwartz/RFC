IAB MESSAGE

     STANDARDS ACTIONS

     The following list shows the protocol standards actions approved by
     the IAB since May 1, 1991.

       o MIME -- Multipurpose Mail Extensions

           Proposed Standard    June 1992

             RFC-1341, "MIME  (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions):
                        Mechanisms for Specifying and Describing
                        the Format of Internet Message Bodies"

             RFC-1342, "Representation of Non-ASCII Text in Internet
                        Message Headers"

       o PPP Link Quality Monitoring

           Proposed Standard:     May 1992
             RFC 1333: "PPP Link Quality Monitoring"

       o Mapping between X.400 and RFC-822

           Historic:    May 1992   (obsoleted by RFC-1327).
             RFC-987,  "Mapping between X.400 and RFC-822", June 1986
             RFC-1026, "Addendum to RFC-987", September 1987

       o PPP-INIT -- PPP Initial Configuration Options

           Historic:    May 1992  (obsoleted by revised PPP)
             RFC-1172, "The Point-to-Point (PPP) Initial Configuration
                        Option"

       o PEM -- Privacy-Enhanced Mail

           Historic:    May 1992
             RFC-1113, "Privacy Enhancement for Internet Electronic
                        Mail: Part I -- Message Encipherment and
                        Authentication Procedures"
             RFC-1114, "Privacy Enhancement for Internet Electronic
                        Mail: Part II -- Certificate-Based Key
                        Management"
             RFC-1115, "Privacy Enhancement for Internet Electronic
                        Mail:Part III -- Algorithms, Modes, and
                        Identifiers"



Cooper                                                          [Page 3]

Internet Monthly Report                                         May 1992


          NOTE: New versions of the PEM RFC's are nearly ready for
          introduction into the standards track.  Since 1113-1115 no
          longer reflect current practice and since there were very
          few implementations of these obsolete specifications, the
          PEM Working Group and the IESG recommended that they be
          declared Historic.

     NEW RFC's

       The following standards RFC's were published in May,
       reflecting decisions reported previously.

       o IPCP -- PPP Internet Protocol Control Protocol

           Proposed Standard:        May 1992
             RFC-1332, "The PPP Internet Protocol Control Protocol
             (IPCP)".

       o PPP -- Point-to-Point Protocol (new version)

           Proposed Standard:        May 1992
             RFC-1331, "The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) for the
               Transmission of Multi-protocol Datagrams over
               Point-to-Point Links".

       o Downgrading X.400(1988) to X.400(1984)

           Proposed Standard:        May 1992
             RFC-1328, "X.400 1988 to 1984 downgrading"

       o Mapping between X.400(1988)/ISO 10021 and RFC-822

           Proposed Standard:        May 1992
             RFC-1327, "Mapping between X.400(1988)/ISO 10021 and
             RFC 822"

           Note: the title of this RFC is misleading; it actually gives
           the mapping for both X.400(1988) and X.400(1984).  Therefore,
           it obsoletes RFC-987 and RFC-1026 (see above), which defined
           a Proposed Standard for the X.400(1984) mapping.


     STANDARDS ACTIONS PENDING ON MAY 1, 1992

        'Multiprotocol Interconnect on X.25 and ISDN in Packet Mode'
           to Proposed Standard

           Under consideration by IAB.

Internet Monthly Report                                         May 1992


        'PPP Authentication Protocols' to Proposed Standard

           Under consideration by IAB.

        'SNMP Security' to Proposed Standard

           Awaiting Working Group consideration of revisions
           recommended by the IAB.

        'BGP NEXT-HOP-SNPA Attribute' to Proposed Standard.

           Held up for discussion with IESG.  Concern was general
           architectural issues raised by this specification.

INTERNET ENGINEERING REPORTS
----------------------------

     1. Let me remind everyone that the next IETF meeting, co-hosted
        by MIT and NEARNet, will take place from July 13th through the
        17th in Cambridge, Massachusettes. The Sunday night reception
        will be held at the Hyatt Regency Cambridge begining at 6 PM
        on July 12th.

        As was done in Atlanta, TSIG will be meeting concurrently with
        the IETF at the Hyatt, and a number of joint sessions are planned.

        Complete registration and logistics information has already been
        mailed to the IETF mailing list. For copies of this information
        (or for any other question about the upcoming meeting), please
        mail your request to ietf-rsvp@nri.reston.va.us.

        Based on input and suggetions received, there will be a
        slightly different meeting agenda in Cambridge, specifically
        to provide more meeting slots for Working Groups and BOFs.
        Additionally, technical presentations will be spread across
        the week in the mornings.

        Looking ahead, the Fall IETF is scheduled for November 16-20,
        1992 in Washington, DC. Our local host is U.S. Sprint. The
        Spring 1993 IETF will be held in Columbus, Ohio, March 28th -
        April 2nd. Our Local Hosts will be OARnet and The Ohio State
        University.

     2. As many of you know, there is a history of confusion and
        misinformation pertaining to the status of Internet Drafts,
        especially when incorrectly assuming them to be Internet
        Standards. Also, there has been a significant number of
        requests to provide paper copies of Internet Drafts by
        postal mail. Because of these reasons, the following changes
        in the content are being implemented for Internet Drafts, and
        all new Internet Draft submissions must comply with these
        requirements.

        a.   The following text *MUST* be included in a Status of
             the Memo section.

             This document is an Internet Draft.  Internet Drafts
             are working documents of the Internet Engineering Task
             Force (IETF), its Areas, and its Working Groups. Note
             that other groups may also distribute working documents
             as Internet Drafts.




Cooper                                                          [Page 6]

Internet Monthly Report                                         May 1992


             Internet Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum
             of six months.  Internet Drafts may be updated, replaced,
             or obsoleted by other documents at any time.  It is not
             appropriate to use Internet Drafts as reference material
             or to cite them other than as a "working draft" or "work
             in progress."

             Please check the I-D abstract listing contained in each
             Internet Draft directory to learn the current status of
             this or any other Internet Draft.

        b.   A Document Expiration Date must appear on the first and
             last page of the Internet Draft. The Expiration date is
             always six months following the submission of the document
             as an Internet Draft.

        Authors can calculate the six month period by adding 5 days
        to the date when the final version is completed. This should
        be more than enough to cover the time need to send the
        document or notification of the document's availability to
        internet-drafts@nri.reston.va.us.

        All Internet Draft documents received, including Postscript
        versions, *must* comply with these requirements. If a document
        is received that does not, the author will be notified and a
        new version will be requested.

        The Guidelines to Authors of Internet Drafts <1id-guidelines.txt>
        in the shadow directories has been updated.


     3. The IESG received one request to consider the following Internet
        Draft as a standards track item:

        a. "An Architecture for Inter-Domain Policy Routing" and
            "Inter-Domain Policy Routing Protocol Specification and
            Usage: Version 1" as a proposed standard. Internet draft
            documents are <draft-ietf-idpr-architecture-04 and
            <draft-ietf-idpr-specv1-01> respectively.

        A Last Call notification was sent to the IETF list.

     4. As part of the protocol grandfathering process begun at the
        February 1990 IETF meeting, the IESG is considering
        recommending status changes for a number of protocols:

Internet Monthly Report                                         May 1992


        a. RFC 0783, Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP), to be
           elevated to Full Standard status. A new version of this
           protocol is available in the Internet Drafts directory
           <draft-ietf-iesg-tftp-00.txt>.

        b. RFC 1006 (ISO Transport Service on top of the TCP),
           RFC 0954 (NICNAME/WHOIS), and RFC 1058 (Routing Information
           Protocol) to be elevated to Full Standard status.

        c. RFC 0734 (SUPDUP), RFC 0913 (Simple File Transfer Protocol
                    (SFTP)),
           RFC 0953 (Hostname Server Protocol), RFC 1037 (NFILE), and
           RFC 1056 (PCMAIL) to be changed to Historic Status.

        d. RFC 1139 (Echo function for ISO 8473 (ISO PING)) for
           elevation to Draft Standard status.

        Last Call notifications were sent to the IETF list for all of
        the above.

     5. The IESG made the following recommendations to the IAB during
        the month of May, 1992:

        a. PPP Authentication Protocols
           <draft-ietf-pppext-authentication-04> be published as a
           Proposed Standard.

        b. Multiprotocol Interconnect on X.25 and ISDN in the Packet
           Mode <draft-ietf-iplpdn-x25_isdn> be published as a Proposed
           Standard.

        c. The Privacy Enhanced Mail Protocols (PEM) as defined in
           RFCs 1113, 1114, and 1115 be moved to Historic Status.

     6. 16 Internet Draft Actions were taken between May 1 and 31, 1992

           (Revised draft (o), New Draft (+) )

BOLT BERANEK AND NEWMAN INC.
----------------------------

     INTER DOMAIN POLICY ROUTING

     During the month of May, we answered questions on the IDPR Internet
     Drafts and revised these documents in response to comments
     submitted by the IETF community.  Also, a few more groups have
     expressed interest in participating in the IDPR pilot
     demonstration, and we have been bringing them up to speed.  We are
     expecting to receive the IDPR gated software in the next few weeks,
     and at that time, we can begin to experiment with this software in
     a few selected sites.

     ST CONFERENCING

     The major conferencing activity during May was the FOJT exercise.
     This involved continuously-available secure conferencing between
     NSC and WPC over a 19-day period.  In addition to this exercise,
     there were seven other conferences.  Four of the conferences
     involved three sites the rest were point-to-point connections.

     The major simulation activity during May was a demonstration of
     multi-way simulation involving Ft. Knox, Ft. Rucker, IDA, and a
     temporary extension to the Senate conference room.  This was a
     successful 1 day demonstration.  In addition to this demonstration,
     there was one two-site simulation exercise.

     All video conferencing sites except Frankfurt have now been
     converted to SPC framing adaptors.  Because of incompatibility
     between butterfly/PC-based conferencing and T/20/SPC-based
     conferencing, this conversion means we are no longer able to
     conduct multi-way conferences through the four-window hub at BBN.
     Instead, we are fielding floor-control software, which allows a
     conference moderator to direct which site is displayed on
     participants' screens during a multiway conference.  This software
     requires updates to the gateway and local Sun software at each
     site.  Deployments to all existing conferencing sites should be
     completed in June.

Internet Monthly Report                                         May 1992


     Over the next few months, we will be supporting several exercises
     that require secure simulation and conferencing.  During these
     exercises, the participating sites will not be available for
     unclassified conferencing or simulation.  We will track site
     availability using the usual video conference request system and
     the on-line calendar that is available via anonymous ftp from
     labs-n (file name CONFERENCE.CALENDAR).

CICNET
-------

     CICNet activities for April and May, 1992

     The CICNet Network Information Resources Committee met on April 21
     in Chicago.  The meeting was attended by 30 representatives from
     CICNet member sites and meeting topics included publication of the
     CICNet User Guide, the Gopher information server, the CNI TopNode
     project, and a presentation by Joe Blackmon of NCSA on the digital
     library project.  In late April CICNet staff met with members of
     the Indiana Data Network to discuss areas of mutual interest and
     cooperation.

     In May, the NSFNET node at Argonne National Laboratory was brought
     on line.  This connection to NSFNET now provides CICNet with three
     connections to the NSFNET T-3 backbone.  CICNet served as a co-
     sponsor for the Third Annual Conference on Computing in the Social
     Sciences, held in Ann Arbor on May 4-7.CICNet staff member John
     Hankins served as technical coordinator for the conference which
     was attended by over 200 social scientists from the North America,
     Europe, and Australia.  On May 4, CICNet President Mike Staman gave
     a presentation titled "A Framework for Supporting Users of the
     Internet" at the1992 Conference of the Faxon Institute.  Joiner
     Software of Madison, Wisconsin became a member of CICNet in May.

CONCERT
-------

     CONCERT added two new schools this month to its list of connected
     sites.  Thenew schools are Campbell University and Mt. Olive
     College.

     MCNC was host the the Spring FARNET meeting on May 13-15. The focus
     of the meeting was the business aspects of running mid-level
     networks.

Internet Monthly Report                                         May 1992


     CONCERT staff members participated in the Interop exhibition held
     in Washington, DC, where they demonstrated Packet Video
     Videoconferencing facilities running over the Internet. As a part
     of the ANS booth, the demonstration was a joint effort of ANS, IBM,
     and CONCERT staff.  The setup included two RS6000 workstations,
     each containing an IBM supplied interface connecting to a CLI
     codec.  With one workstation on the show floor and one inNorth
     Carolina, the packet video traffic was routed via TCP/IP over the
     ANS production T3 backbone, with T1 tail links at each end.  In a
     window on the workstation, Interop visitors were able to
     participate in interactive collaborative sessions with personnel in
     MCNC`s Communications Center locatedin Research Triangle Park,
     North Carolina.  When interactive teleconferences were not active,
     viewers were able to see regularly scheduled programming from one
     of the Raleigh, NC broadcast networks or one of the programs on
     MCNC's CONCERT Video Network's general purpose channels.

CSUNET (THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY NETWORK)
-----------------------------------------------

     Activities this month include:

     + at Sacramento, the BARRNET Proteon router was removed--now CSUnet
     at Sacramento is joined via T-1 to BARRnet at UCDavis using Cisco
     routers

     + at San Diego, CSUnet is now T-1 connected to SDSCNET (part of the
     San Diego SuperComputer Center) instead of CERFNET.  The current
     T-1 CERFNET connection in Irvine remains

     + CSUnet announced a commitment to provide ARA (Apple's Remote
     Access) connectivity on all of its CSUnet Access Ports (CAPS).
     This expected to be turnkey in August-September.  The toughest
     problems to conquer will be those of user-id/password management.

     + CSUnet is extending to the official CSU off-site centers across
     the State.  This month, the Monterrey County Campus is in the
     works.  The connection to Monterrey will cause CSUnet to have a
     point of presence in every LATA in California.

     + In Mexico, the Instituto Technologico de Mexicali international
     circuit provided by AT&T came due and is undergoing installation.
     This will extend CSUnet into Mexico to the ITM University there.

EPILOGUE TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION
-------------------------------

     As you may have already heard, Epilogue's new demo at Interop
     Spring fall we had a bunch of little weather stations that allowed
     one to poll for current weather conditions via SNMP queries into
     our "weather" MIB.  Well, the bear's mission was to sit in our
     booth at Interop, poll some of those weather stations, and speak
     the results.  We did not get as many of the weather stations set up
     in advance as we would have liked, but we did have one running at
     FTP Software's office in Wakefield, MA.  So, thanks to good
     connectivity through the Interop Shownet, Alternet, and Nearnet, we
     were able to deliver real-time weather reports from Wakefield via a
     talking (and blinking) teddy bear in Washington.

     The bear was particularly cute when the occasional packet dropped
     and he said "retransmitting" while batting his eyes.  Of course I'm
     kinda biased, since he's got my wife's voice....

     Hardware credits go to Talking Technologies of Alameda, CA for the
     controller card, the electronics department of the Harvard Coop for
     the bear itself, and various Radio Shack stores for the usual odds
     and ends.  They all got paid, but that's only fair.

     The less said about the company (which will remain nameless to
     protect the guilty) which sold me the PC that blew its brains out
     15 minutes before the press arrived, the better.  Many thanks to
     the electricians at the Washington Convention Center, who let me
     hide next to their lounge area while swapping hardware into a new
     machine.

     The bear made the front page of Communications Week ("Talking Bear
     Teaches SNMP") about two weeks before the show.  I don't know if
     it's been written up elsewhere.  Several members of the press took
     pictures during the show, I don't know if any of them have seen
     print.

     Let me know if you want or need more details.

     GIGABIT NETWORKING

     ATOMIC:

     The ATOMIC project has recently been concentrating on routing
     issues.  Specifically, we have been enhancing the capability of the
     Address Consultant (AC) process so that it is more robust in the
     face of failures and is able to map more complex networks than in
     the past.

     The AC is now able to map Non-Symmetric/Consistent networks.  This
     AC can handle links that only go one-way, but the links must still
     go

             From                    To
             ----                    --
             East out        ->      East in
             West out        ->      West in
             North out       ->      North in
             South out       ->      South in

     To map such a network, the Mosaic processors are required to
     implement a modified form of broadcasting so that the address
     consultant eventually receives copies of any messages it sends out.

     A non-consistent network would violate the routing rules given
     above.  These networks pose some interesting (as yet unsolved)
     challenges.

     The AC now also deals with the problem of deadlocks by discovering
     cycles and making sure that the routes created have no potential to
     create a lock-up.

     Finally, the AC code was converted to Xwindows to allow the display
     of complicated network maps.

     This month we submitted an article to ConneXions about the IETF
     audiocast.  We tested the upgraded Concept codecs, made changes to
     Vision7 program for our use, copied eproms for the new codecs,
     shipped back Mitre's, and upgraded BBN's.  We made the DARTNET-6
     kernel, tested with SRI, investigated conversion of Suntools
     programs to X using XView and tested this on the Phonetool.

LOS NETTOS
----------

     The AGS+ upgrade is almost complete.  One site remains to be
     upgraded. 9.0 ROMs and documentation have been received.

     An X-windows based graphic display tool, xnetdb, developed by Henry
     Clark of Ohio State University, for network monitoring, has been
     retrieved.  It may be a good network status demonstration tool for
     Los Nettos.

NSFNET/ANSNET BACKBONE ENGINEERING
----------------------------------

     T3 Network Status
     =================

     The major event for May was the successful completion of the
     deployment of new "RS/960" DS3 interface cards on the entire T3
     backbone. The five week deployment went very smoothly, and the new
     cards have increased the reliability and performance of the
     network.  Cutovers of traffic from the T1 to the T3 backbones were
     suspended and delayed until June because of the deployment
     activities.  Other activities of interest include new build and
     routing daemon software on the T3 network nodes.

     Two of the three links to CA*Net (Toronto to Ithaca, and Montreal
     to Princeton) were upgraded from fractional-T1 rate to full T1 rate
     this month.

     The T1 backbone is stable now that it is carrying less than 50% of
     the total NSFNET traffic, though the RCP nodes continue to be
     closely monitored since they are still carrying the full routing
     advertisements.

     Full traffic statistics for the T3 net are not available because
     the initial software release for the RS/960 support on the T3
     backbone did not support returning the interface counters from the
     SNMP MIB. This will be corrected for the month of June. Also, the
     net to net matrix statistics are not available. A sampling
     technique is being developed which will allow this data to be
     collected once again.

     Routing Daemon Changes
     ======================

     The rcp_routed program for the T3 network was upgraded to a new
     version containing several improvements. These included a change to
     allow Cisco peer routers to accept a full routing table (~4000
     networks) from the ENSS. There is now an option for rcp_routed to
     add a time delay when the peer is a slower processor. All Ciscos in
     the backbone now have a full routing table rather than using
     default. Another change was made to fix a problem that caused an
     internal-BGP connection to be reset.  Several bug fixes that causes
     crashes or daemon restarts were fixed.

Internet Monthly Report                                         May 1992


     SNMP Daemon Changes
     ===================

     The RS/960 software build does not include the ability to obtain
     ethernet interface statistics. This will be corrected the week of
     June 8. As of June 3, traffic statistics were available for the
     ENSS T3 interfaces. These figures can be used to closely
     approximate traffic counts for the ENSS nodes. It should be noted
     that both the if[In|Out]McastPkts and if[In|Out]UcastPkts variables
     should be queried and summed for both T3 and ethernet interfaces,
     for those who are polling the backbone nodes.

     RS/960 Deployment Chronology
     ============================

     Following is a summary of the 5 week deployment activities for May
     which completed installation of the RS/960 DS3 hardware adaptors in
     all T3 network nodes.

     Step 2: May 1-2

     Step 2 of the phase-III network upgrade was successfully completed
     last Saturday 5/2.  Following this step, these T3 backbone nodes
     were running new T3 hardware and software in a stable
     configuration:

     Seattle POP:    CNSS88, CNSS89, CNSS91
     Denver POP:     CNSS96, CNSS97, CNSS99
     San Fran. POP:  CNSS8,  CNSS9,  CNSS11
     L.A. POP:       CNSS16, CNSS17, CNSS19
     Regionals:      ENSS141 (Boulder), ENSS142 (Salt Lake), ENSS143
                     (U. Washington)
                     ENSS128 (Palo Alto), ENSS144 (FIX-W), ENSS135
                     (San Diego)

     CNSS8, CNSS16, CNSS96 are now running with mixed technology (e.g.
     3xRS960 T3 interfaces, 1xHawthorne T3 interface).  Production
     traffic on the affected Bay Area ENSS nodes was cutover to the T1
     backbone at 2:00 AM EST on 5/2.  Production traffic on ENSS135 was
     cutover two hours earlier.  The San Francisco and Los Angeles POP
     nodes were returned to full service by 10:50 AM EST on 5/2, well
     within the planned maintainence window.

     The maintainence in the Los Angeles POP was complicated by the
     curfew existing at that time.  Normally a specially trained 2-3
     person deployment team is scheduled to perform these upgrades at
     each POP location.  Because of the circumstances in Los Angeles, a
     special IBM engineer (Carl Kraft) from Gaithersberg, Maryland was



Cooper                                                         [Page 24]

Internet Monthly Report                                         May 1992


     deployed to the Los Angeles POP to perform the upgrade by himself.
     Carl was able to upgrade the node single-handedly on schedule.

     Several new procedures were developed following the first
     deployment step in Seattle and Denver on 4/25.  These procedures
     helped to reduce the installation window and number of installation
     problems experienced on 4/25.

     The only problem experienced was the supected failure of a single
     RS960 adapter during the installation at ENSS128 (Palo Alto).  This
     problem was isolated to the adapter within several minutes and the
     adapter was swapped resulting in successful operation of the node.
     A subsequent failure analysis of the RS960 adapter has not resulted
     in any reproducible problems, and has been attributed to an
     improper seating of the adapter in ENSS128 during the initial
     installation.

     Next Steps
     ==========

     Based upon the successful completion of step 2 of the deployment,
     step3 was scheduled to commence at 23:00 local time on 5/8.  Step 3
     will involve the following nodes/locations:

     Chicago POP:            CNSS24, CNSS25, CNSS27
     Cleveland POP:          CNSS40, CNSS41, CNSS43
     New York City POP:      CNSS32, CNSS33, CNSS35
     Hartford POP:           CNSS48, CNSS49, CNSS51
     San Fran. POP:          CNSS8 (Second visit to CNSS8->CNSS24
                             Interface)

     Regionals:              ENSS130 (Argonne), ENSS131 (Ann Arbor),
                             ENSS132 (Pittsburgh)
                             ENSS133 (Ithaca), ENSS134 (Boston), ENSS137
                             (Princeton)

     Other ENSS's Affected:  E152, E162, E154, E158, E167, E168, E171,
                             E172, E163, E155, E160, E161, E164, E169

     The system software (build 2.78.22) required to support RS960
     installations has been fully deployed to all T3 network nodes as of
     early this week.  New rcp_routed software has also been installed
     on all T3 nodes, although this is not a pre-requisite for any
     phase-III deployment activities.  The new rcp_routed software has
     enhancements including support for externally administered inter-AS
     metrics, an auto-restart capability, and a fix for the invalid
     acceptance by the ENSS of a route to itself from a peer.

Internet Monthly Report                                         May 1992


     Following the step 3 deployment, selected T3 internal link metrics
     will be adjusted to support load balancing of traffic across the 5
     different hybrid technology links that will exist.  The selection
     of these link metrics has been chosen through a calculation of
     traffic distributions on each link based upon an AS<->AS traffic
     matrix. This step of the deployment involves 4 POPs, and will
     complete the coast to coast RS/960 path for a large proportion of
     the backbone traffic.

     During the step 3 deployment, the Ann Arbor ENSS will be isolated
     from the T3 backbone. Since the Merit/ANS NOC is located in Ann
     Arbor, and Merit's backup connectivity to the backbone will be
     through the T1 network, we are implementing a backup network
     management machine. The "rover" monitoring tool is running on an
     unused RS/6000 CNSS at the Denver POP, and its data collection
     capability will be used if there is any problem with Merit's
     connection to the T3 backbone.

     Also during this deployment the Princeton ENSS will be isolated
     from the backbone. This means that both the Ann Arbor T1/T3
     interconnect gateway and its backup at Princeton will not be
     operational. Therefore on Friday night we will run the Houston
     interconnect as primary, and temporarily configure the San Diego
     interconnect gateway as secondary with load sharing being handled
     as with the Ann Arbor/Houston configuration.

     ===================================================================

     Step 3: May 8-9

     Step 3 of the phase-III network was successfully completed Saturday
     5/9.  This was the most extensive step that was planned as part of
     the phase-III deployment.  It was completed with only a few minor
     problems that caused us to extend our scheduled maintainence window
     by 1 hour and 55 minutes. The deployment was completed at 11:55 EST
     on 5/9.  Following this deployment, these T3 backbone nodes were
     currently running with new T3 RS960 hardware and software in a
     stable configuration:

     Seattle POP:            CNSS88, CNSS89, CNSS91
     Denver POP:             CNSS96, CNSS97, CNSS99
     San Fran. POP:          CNSS8,  CNSS9,  CNSS11
     L.A. POP:               CNSS16, CNSS17, CNSS19
     Chicago POP:            CNSS24, CNSS25, CNSS27
     Cleveland POP:          CNSS40, CNSS41, CNSS43

     technology (e.g.  3xRS960 T3 interfaces, 1xHawthorne T3 interface).

     Step 3 Deployment Difficulties
     ==============================

     During the step 3 deployment, there was a suspected bad RS/960 card
     removed from the Ann Arbor ENSS131 node.  This took about 1 hour of
     trouble shooting time.

     The T1-C1 (C35) crashed and would not reboot.  This turned out to
     be a loose connector to the SCSI controller.  This was probably due
     the physical move of all CNSS equipment within the NYU POP.

     There was a problem getting the link to Argonne E130 back online.
     This turned out to be a misconnected cable on the DSU.
     There was also an early Saturday morning problem with the T3-B
     machine at the Cleveland POP.  The machine would come up, and then
     crash within minutes.  A number of different troubleshooting
     procedures were attempted, and the final solution was to replace
     the RS960 card which inter-connects the T3-B machine to the T3-C1
     (e.g. C40->C41).  There was a metal shaving on the HSSI connector,
     however when this was removed, the card still did not work.  This
     was the last machine to be upgraded and it took us a few hours to
     fix (9am-11am).

     Finally, during the trouble shooting of the Cleveland CNSS40 node,
     we found the RS960 card in the Chicago POP CNSS27 node had frozen
     (probably mis-seated or broken card).  It had been running fine for
     an estimated 5 hours.  The card was replaced.

     Ten hours after the upgrade, everything seemed to be normal with
     one exception.  There was an abnormal packet loss rate between
     CNSS8<->CNSS9 measured via an on-card RS960 utility program.  The
     RS960 card in the CNSS8 node was replaced Sunday at 6:00am PST.

     During the deployment activities the "rover" monitoring software
     was running at both Merit (Ann Arbor) and ANS (Elmsford), with a
     backup monitor running at an unused RS/6000 CNSS at the Denver POP.

Internet Monthly Report                                         May 1992


     An effort was made to leave either Ann Arbor or Elmsford up and
     connected to the T3 backbone at all times during the night, so that
     the backup monitor was not required to be used. The NOC was able to
     successfully monitor the T1 and T3 backbones throughout the
     deployment timeframe.

     In addition to all the normal deployment activities, we were able
     to swap the T960 ethernet card at Pittsburgh.

     Following the weekend deployment, we identified an RS960 card on
     CNSS25 that was recording some DMA underrun errors. This was not
     affecting user traffic, but the card was scheduled to be swapped
     out as a pre-caution.  Since we are revisiting the Chicago POP site
     during the upcoming step 4 deployment this weekend, we will replace
     the card then.

     Taking into consideration that we upgraded 4 POPs at the same time,
     we feel this deployment went rather well.  There were 4 RS960 cards
     that were shipped backed to IBM for failure analysis.  Preliminary
     analysis in the lab did not result in any reproducible failures.

     We now have a complete cross-country RS960 path established.  We
     have established modified T3 link metrics to balance traffic across
     the 5 existing hybrid links.  We are watching very closely over the
     next two weeks for any circuit or equipment problems that result in
     the cross-country RS960 path being broken, since this could cause
     congestion on one or more hybrid links.

     Step 4 Deployment Scheduled for 5/15
     ====================================

     Based upon the successful completion of step 3 of the deployment,
     step 4 was scheduled to commence at 23:00 local time on 5/15.  Step
     4 involved the following nodes/locations:

     St. Louis POP:          CNSS80, CNSS81, CNSS83
     Houston POP:            CNSS64, CNSS65, CNSS67
     Second Visit:           CNSS96 (Denver), CNSS24 (Chicago),
                             CNSS16 (L.A.)
     Regionals:              ENSS129 (Champaign), ENSS140 (Lincoln),
                             ENSS139 (Rice)

     Other ENSS's Affected:  ENSS165, ENSS157, ENSS174, ENSS173

     During this deployment the Houston ENSS139 node will be isolated
     from the backbone.  Therefore the Houston T1/T3 interconnect will
     be switched over to San Diego ENSS135 prior to the deployment.  The
     Ann Arbor ENSS131 interconnect gateway is expected to remain

     operational throughout the deployment.

     Following the step 4 deployment, selected T3 internal link metrics
     will be readjusted to support load balancing of traffic across the
     3 different hybrid technology links that will exist.  The selection
     of these link metrics has been chosen through a calculation of
     traffic distributions on each link based upon an AS<->AS traffic
     matrix.

     ===================================================================

     Step 4: May 15-16

     Step 4 of the phase-III network was successfully completed Saturday
     5/16.  All T3 nodes were back on-line within the scheduled
     maintainance window with the exception of the Houston CNSS67 T1
     concentrator due to software configuration problem, and ENSS129
     (Champaign) due to a T3 circuit problem.  The upgrade of all other
     nodes were completed by 10:00 EST on 5/16.  Following this
     deployment these T3 backbone nodes were running new T3 RS960
     hardware and software in a stable configuration:

     Seattle POP:            CNSS88, CNSS89, CNSS91
     Denver POP:             CNSS96, CNSS97, CNSS99
     San Fran. POP:          CNSS8,  CNSS9,  CNSS11
     L.A. POP:               CNSS16, CNSS17, CNSS19
     Chicago POP:            CNSS24, CNSS25, CNSS27
     Cleveland POP:          CNSS40, CNSS41, CNSS43
     New York City POP:      CNSS32, CNSS33, CNSS35
     Hartford POP:           CNSS48, CNSS49, CNSS51
     St. Louis POP:          CNSS80, CNSS81, CNSS83
     Houston POP:            CNSS64, CNSS65, CNSS67

     Regionals:      ENSS141 (Boulder), ENSS142 (Salt Lake), ENSS143
                     (U. Washington)
                     ENSS128 (Palo Alto), ENSS144 (FIX-W), ENSS135
                     (San Diego)
                     ENSS130 (Argonne), ENSS131 (Ann Arbor),
                     ENSS132 (Pittsburgh), ENSS133 (Ithaca), ENSS134
                     (Boston)
                     ENSS137 (Princeton), ENSS129 (Champaign), ENSS140
                     (Lincoln)
                     ENSS139 (Rice)

     The CNSS32, CNSS48, CNSS64 nodes are now running with mixed
     technology (e.g.  3xRS960 T3 interfaces, 1xHawthorne T3 interface).

     Step 4 Deployment Difficulties
     ==============================

     The RS960 week 4 deployment was successful with two exceptions.
     The first problem involved the link between ENSS129 (Champaign) and
     CNSS81 (St.  Louis POP).  The second problem was the T1
     concentrator in Houston (C67).  This affected ENSS174 (IBM Austin)
     and ENSS173 (ITESM).

     On ENSS129, a jumper was initially found to be missing from the
     HSSI board and the jumper was added.  ENSS129 was then successfully
     brought up online at 6:20 EST.  Later in the morning, the
     ENSS129<->CNSS81 link began to experience packet loss.  The DSUs
     were reporting coding violations and bipolar violations on the
     E129<->C81 link.  As a result of the noise on the link, the RS960
     card on CNSS81 was un-able to self re-initialize.  After some
     unsuccessful DSU hardware changes, CNSS81 was rebooted and the
     RS960 card successfully reset at 13:00 EST.  We then suspected a
     bad DS3 card in the DSU in ENSS129 which was replaced, however this
     did not solve the problem.  The problem turned out to be a bad DS3
     radio circuit between ENSS129->CNSS81 and MCI swapped the radio
     channel to clear the problem.

     At the Houston POP, CNSS64 and CNSS65 were upgraded and came up
     without problems.  ENSS139 (Rice U.) also came up without any
     problems.  However CNSS67 (the T1 concentrator) had complex
     problems.  CNSS67 was taken down around 00:00 and the mechanical
     modifications were completed and bootup began at 2:15 EST.  The
     machine rebooted and we started troubleshooting.  All RS960 cards
     and the planar board were replaced in various combinations.  The
     node kept crashing after an ifconfig of the T960 T1 card in slot 2.
     We suspected that two T960 T1 cards were bad and one was moved over
     from the CNSS65 machine to the CNSS67 node.  We are not sure why
     CNSS65 had a T960 T1 card installed in the first place.  After
     installing several combinations of hardware, we still could not get
     a working CNSS67 configuration.  After considerable analysis of the
     ODM database, we suspected some ODM problems and we chose to re-
     install the system software from a tape built from another machine.
     The machine came right up on the first try at 14:00 EST with the
     same original hardware installed (including the original new RS960
     card).  This was clearly a system software problem and there are no
     suspected hardware failures resulting from this.

     At the St. Louis POP, CNSS80, CNSS81, and CNSS83 were all upgraded
     and came up without any problems, 3 hours ahead of schedule at 4:45
     EST.

Internet Monthly Report                                         May 1992


     At the Denver POP, a loose serial port connector delayed the
     upgrade start time by a few minutes.  We could not access the DSU
     through the out-of-band modem.  It is not known when the connection
     broke since it worked last week.  An ODM adapter configuration
     problem was also fixed where cards were coming up up in the wrong
     slots.  However these problems were solved and the Denver
     maintainence was completed well within the scheduled window.

     Routing was enabled and traffic flow started through the southern
     route (through Houston POP) by 9:35 EST even though the Houston T1
     concentrator was still down so that the RS960 hybrid link upgrade
     at CNSS24 in the Chicago POP and the scheduled CNSS25 RS960 card
     replacement could begin on schedule.  When CNSS24 would not come up
     smoothly with the new RS960 card, it was replaced without
     attempting to troubleshoot the system or the card.  The replaced
     RS960 card will be returned to IBM for failure analysis. The RS960
     card in CNSS25 was replaced as scheduled due to DMA under-runs
     which plagued us last week.  This installation went as planned and
     the machine came up 10:50 EST.

     We continued to closely monitor the RS960 adapters using the data
     collection programs that have been developed (e.g. ccstat -c,
     ccstat -d data) for any new card level problems.  New T3 internal
     link metrics were installed to support load balancing of traffic
     across the 3 different hybrid technology links that existed (e.g.
     CNSS64<->CNSS72, CNSS48<->CNSS72, CNSS32<->CNSS56).

     Step 4 Deployment Scheduled for 5/22
     ====================================

     Based upon the successful completion of step 4 of the deployment,
     step 5 was scheduled to commence at 23:00 local time on 5/22. Step
     5 is the final phase-III upgrade step and will complete the
     deployment.  This will involve the following nodes/locations:

     Greensboro POP:         CNSS72, CNSS73, CNSS75
     Washington D.C. POP:    CNSS56, CNSS57, CNSS58, CNSS59
     2nd Site Visit:         CNSS32 (New York POP),
                             CNSS64 (Houston POP)
                             CNSS48 (Hartford POP)

     Regionals:              ENSS138 (Georgia Tech.),
                             ENSS136 (College Park)
                             ENSS145 (FIX-E)

     Other Nodes Affected:   ENSS150 (Concert), ENSS151,
                             ENSS153, ENSS166




Cooper                                                         [Page 31]

Internet Monthly Report                                         May 1992


     Following the step 5 deployment, all T3 internal link metrics will
     be re-adjusted to their normal metrics since no hybrid technology
     links will exist.

     ===================================================================

     Step 5: May 22-23

     The fifth, and final, stage of the Phase 3 deployment was commenced
     at 23:00 hours Friday, May 22 and completed by turning on all
     traffic through a rebuilt, RS960 based backbone at 09:38 Saturday
     morning.  The problems encountered were relatively minor and were
     dealt with rather quickly, enabling return to full operation ahead
     of schedule.

     The resulting stability of the T3 network has been excellent since
     this final cutover.  We are very grateful to all of the regional-
     techs that assisted and cooperated with us during the 5 week
     deployment.

     Week 5 Problems
     ===============

     At Washington POP (CNSS59) after the rebuild, the machine failed to
     reboot properly in "SECURE" mode. The service switch was found to
     be defective and was replaced. CNSS57, targeted to be a spare, was
     cannibalized for the spare part.

     At Washington POP (CNSS58) the RS960 T3 card in slot 4 failed to
     load its microcode and the card was replaced.

     At Washington POP (CNSS56) the node did not recognize an RS960 T3
     card (no POSID).  This indicates that card was not identifying
     itself to the system and the card was replaced.

     At College Park (ENSS136) the RS960 T3 card came up in NONAP mode
     (would not talk to the system) and was replaced.

     At Greensboro POP (CNSS73) a corrupted ODM database was suspected
     and the node system software was reloaded from a prepared tape.
     Deborah Matties-Sharp and Kraig Owen, in anticipation, had all
     sites prepared with bootable back-up tapes and their foresight paid
     off.  Also at Greensboro, the communication cable from the DSU
     servicing Georgia Tech. (ENSS138) was found to be defective (this
     cable previously was operational) and was replaced by removing an
     identical cable from CNSS75 which no longer needed a DSU.  The
     problem was difficult to isolate because the DSU would respond to
     query of the serial number, but would respond with garbaled



Cooper                                                         [Page 32]

Internet Monthly Report                                         May 1992


     messages to other queries.

     It was noted that at Greensboro LBO's had been set at "LONG" (or
     HI) but after the DSU change the T3 circuit to Georgia Tech had to
     be set "SHORT" (or LOW).  We are investigating this further.

     Lastly, at New York POP the cable from the RS6000 serial port#S2
     for the CNSS35 modem was replaced as planned.

     Results
     =======

     It took 27 minutes to have all routes come up from the first site
     (Hartford POP) to the last site Georgia Tech. (ENSS138).

     We have installed new SNMP agent (and sub-agent) software across
     the T3 backbone to support the new variables collected on the RS960
     T3 cards.

     SNMP access for some variables on the T960 ethernet/T1 cards are
     temporarily in-accessible.  We expect to have this supported
     shortly.  SNMP client programs may have to be re-tested to insure
     they are collecting valid data.

     Because there are no more hybrid links (e.g. Hawthorne T3<->RS960
     T3), the T3 network link metrics have been reset to normal values
     in order to split traffic equally across equal hop paths.

RIPE (Reseaux IP Europeens)
----

     RIPE has recently established the RIPE NCC (Network Coordination
     Centre).  The NCC will act as a European NIC and additionally
     provide the coordination services necessary to make the European
     part of the Internet work.  Attached you can find information about
     RIPE, the RIPE NCC and ways to find out more using various servers
     at the NCC via the Internet.

     About RIPE
     ----------

     RIPE (Reseaux IP Europeens) is a collaborative organisation open to
     all European Internet service providers.  The objective of RIPE is
     to ensure the necessary administrative and technical coordination
     to allow the operation of a pan-European IP network.  RIPE does not
     operate a network of its own.  RIPE is the IP activity of RARE.

     RIPE has been functioning since 1989.  Currently more than 60
     organisations participate in the work.  The result of the RIPE
     coordination effort is that the individual end-user is presented on
     his desktop with a uniform IP service irrespective of the
     particular network his or her workstation is attached to.  Today
     more than 170.000 computers throughout Europe are reachable via
     networks coordinated by RIPE.  The total number of systems
     reachable worldwide is estimated at more than 800.000.

     About the RIPE NCC
     ------------------

     The RIPE Network Coordination Centre supports all those RIPE
     activities which cannot be effectively performed by volunteers from
     the participating organisations.  Besides supporting RIPE
     activities in general the NCC provides the following services to
     network operators:

         o network management database containing information about
           IP networks, DNS domains, IP routing policies and contact
           information

         o delegated Internet registry, a clearing house distributing
           IP network numbers

         o coordinated network statistics gathering

         o domain name system (DNS) coordination

         o graphical maps of IP networks (planned)

         o repository for network operations software

         o RIPE document store

         o interactive information service

     The RIPE NCC currently has 3 permanent staff members.  The RARE
     association provides the formal framework for the NCC.  Funding for
     the first year of operation of the NCC is provided by the national
     members of RARE and EARN.

     The majority of IDPR functionality is integrated with GATED.  There
     are some problems with radix portions of the kernel code, and
     further work on that part is being suspended until after we have
     incorporated SRI's extensions for alternate routing.

     Setup is completed, but needs to undergo some more testing.  The
     link state database portions of route synthesis has been
     sufficeintly tested, but integration work continues for the bfs
     calculation.

     Planned Activities:

     Lab testing of the new implementation will continue in June.  A
     test plan and test report will be available by July.  We will be
     examining opportunities to setup minimal deployment of IDPR in
     actual gateways.  The software will be submitted to Cornell for
     inclusion in the gated release and will be made available at that
     time.

SDSC (SAN DIEGO SUPERCOMPUTER CENTER)
-------------------------------------

     CSUnet has moved their connection at San Diego State University
     from CERFnet to SDSC.  They plan to make the remainder of their So.
     California campuses primary through SDSC over the next few months.

     Two of our three NSC FDDI boxes have been upgraded to the latest
     software Additionally, the Cray addaptor and the Ethernet hardware
     were upgraded.  Thelatter is 3 times faster than what was removed.

     Our connection with the rest of the UCSD campus has been updated.
     Until recently we had an old Proteon p4200 and a DEC LanBridge in

     parallel.  The former handled IP while the latter handled DECnet &
     LAT - an arrangement thatdated from when the p4200 could only do
     IP.  We now have the following inplace:

       -  IP traffic to and from SDSC is now routed via the CERFnet
          FDDI gateway.

       -  DECnet traffic is now routed via the Proteon (over Ethernet.)

       -  LAT traffic is no longer being passed between UCSD and SDSC.

     An additional benefit of this change is that the AppleTalk II
     networks SDSC &UCSD run are isolated from each other's.  During the
     coming month we plan to make extensive changes to out ATII net.

     During July we plan to begin testing the FDDI ring on mesa that
     includes SDSC, Scripps Clinic, and UCSD.  Some of this will be used
     for SigGraph demo that SDSC, the UCSD Med School, and Scripps are
     doing in partnership.

     We expect to expand the membership of the ring in the future.

     Network Performance Related Efforts
     -------------------------------------

     SDSC efforts in the analysis of high speed network performance will
     support both future gigabit realms as well as the current Internet
     network infrastructure.  SDSC is involved in contractual agreements
     for performance analysis related research with NSF, CNRI (supported
     by NSF and DARPA) and IBM.  Areas of current investigations
     include:

        - measurements and analysis of resource consumption and latencies

        - end-to-end communications characteristics in the current
          environment

        - granularity of traffic analysis, both in statistical sampling
          of traffic and in the level of detail required to optimize the
          information/noise ratio.

     Resource Consumption and Latencies
     ----------------------------------

     One fundamental characteristic of packet switched network
     environments is the average delay experienced per packet.  This
     delay is composed of a variety ofcomponents ranging from
     propagation delays to queueing delays.  Our objectiveis to
     understand the variability of this delay in various networking
     environments as well as under varying network conditions.

     A common method of determining one way delay is to divide the round
     trip delay by 2.  We have completed an initial study which shows
     the potential pitfalls in such an assumption by studying observed
     one way and round trip delays and reconciling discrepancies by
     attributing them to short term and long term network phenomenon.

     Predictable and upper-bound guaranteed packet delays are imperative
     to using real-time applications in the current network
     infrastructure.  While it has been demonstrated that under light
     network loads the delays are acceptable, it is not yet clear how
     the delay variance progresses with load for the current
     infrastructure.  SDSC is investigating techniques based on packet
     departure and arrival times which could be applied to this problem.

     The end to end performance and reliability of a network system
     remains, to a large extent, an area which deserves much more
     research attention.  While theInternet base infrastructure
     continues to grow in connectivity, it is not yetclear how the
     system performs or how we could even quantify its characteristics,
     and how current assessment methodologies can be applied to future
     technologies.  Of specific concern here is the CASA gigabit
     infrastructure at its high speed while using highly bandwidth
     demanding applications.

     Application Modeling in the Gigabit Network Environment
     -------------------------------------------------------

     SDSC is investigating application profiles that can use a high
     speed communications infrastructure connecting remote
     supercomputers.  To this end,we are modeling applications based on
     their computational as well as communications needs.

     The development of gigabit/second wide area networks allows the
     tight coupling of remote computers.  Linking disparate computers
     substantially increases theamount of computational power that can
     be applied to problems.  The resultingarchitecture can be viewed as
     a "metacomputer" composed of heterogeneous elements such as Single
     Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) machines such as theThinking



Cooper                                                         [Page 39]

     Machines CM-2, and a vector supercomputer such as the Cray Y-MP.
     Optimal use of a metacomputer depends on the distribution of the
     application among the component computers.

     >From the perspective of the application scientist, the coupling of
     remote computers with a high-speed network provides a new way to
     increase the amountof CPU power that can be applied to a problem.
     Applications can be distributed between heterogeneous computing
     engines to achieve nonlinear speedups.  Nonlinear speedups are
     maximized by decomposing the application in a way thatprovides the
     optimal ratio of the amount of parallel code to the amount of
     nonparallel code.  Simultaneous optimization of CPU and bandwidth
     requires choosing applications with an optimal number of floating-
     point operations per bit of data transmitted.

     Measurement Sampling Techniques
     -------------------------------

     The collection and analysis of network traffic data remains an
     effective means of answering questions ranging from congestion
     issues to capacity planning.  As networks increase in speed
     conventional network equipment struggles to keep up with
     transmission speeds, this process of data collection becomes
     increasingly complicated.  A significant part of SDSC's effort
     centers around scalable tools and methodologies for data collection
     and analysis, which will be imperative for the gigabit networking
     environment.

     An example is SDSC's current study on the effectiveness and
     accuracy of sampling network traffic data.  We are applying various
     sampling methods at different frequencies to traffic traces.  We
     are then comparing the resultingdata sets for accuracy in
     addressing several questions of interest to networktraffic
     characterization.  These metrics include: packet type distribution;
     packet size distibution; geographical traffic flows; and
     interarrival time.

     Preliminary results lead us to believe that sampling may be a valid
     techniqueto address certain traffic characterization issues under
     certain conditions.  However, the applicablity of sampling will
     depend on the volume and temporal range of the gathered data.
     Furthermore, the selection of techniques, i.e., time or event-
     driven, as well as choice of parameters within those techniques,
     e.g., granularity, depends on the question to which one seeks an
     answer.  Research in this area has significant implications for
     today's high-speed, multi-application networking environments which
     often render complete statistics collection impractical.

SRI
----

     SRI's Network Information System Center (NISC) updated the RFC
     Index in response to each RFC issued in May.  There were fifteen
     RFCs issued in May 1992.

     The RFC Index contains citations of all RFCs issued to date in
     reverse numeric order.  It's also a quick reference to determine if
     any RFC has been obsoleted and gives a pointer to the replacement
     RFC.

     The RFC Index also supplies the equivalent FYI number, if the RFC
     was also issued as an FYI document.

     Paper copies of all RFCs are available from SRI, either
     individually or on a subscription basis (for more information
     contact nisc@nisc.sri.com or call 1-415-859-6387).  Online copies
     are available via FTP from ftp.nisc.sri.com as rfc/rfc####.txt or
     rfc/rfc####.ps (#### is the RFC number without leading zeroes).

     Additionally, RFCs may be requested through electronic mail from
     SRI's automated mail server by sending a message to mail-
     server@nisc.sri.com.  In the body of the message, indicate the RFC
     to be sent, e.g. "send rfcNNNN" where NNNN is the number of the

     RFC.  For PostScript RFCs, specify the extension, e.g. "send
     rfcNNNN.ps".  Multiple requests can be sent in a single message by
     specifying each request on a separate line.  The RFC Index can be
     requested by typing "send rfc-index".

     The NISC has also made available two new files taken from parts of
     chapters in their publication entitled "Internet: Getting Started".
     The first file, Internet-access-providers-US.txt, lists service
     providers in the U.S. and provides information regarding which
     providers serve which areas, then lists more complete information
     about each provider.  A companion file called, Internet-access-
     providers-non-US.txt, is a list of those providers that offer
     services to places outside of the U.S.

     Both files are available via FTP from the host ftp.nisc.sri.com in
     the netinfo directory.           For additional information about
     the new publications, "Internet: Getting Started" and "Internet:
     Mailing Lists", contact the NISC directly.

          our antenna farm for various WWVB, GPS and LORAN timing
          receivers. The WWVB receiver is now able to (barely) overwhelm
          the nasty co-channel local interference. Erstwhile time server

          allow synchronization to the pulse-per-second output of some
          timing receivers. This reduces the residual jitter by an order
          of magnitude and improves accuracy to the order of 100
          microseconds.  Primary time server dcn1.udel.edu is configured
          this way now; steps are being taken to configure our DARTNET

     Pilot Management
     ----------------

     The Pilot Directory service has continued to operate smoothly. The
     custos implementation appears to be stable.  Currently, we still
     have active participation from only GSA, NSF, and NIST as far as
     providing agency data for inclusion in the service.  NASA and HHS
     are interested in running DSAs and have requested the software.
     DoE has an existing X.500 pilot (as part of the Internet effort),
     which we are looking into incorporating.

     Interop Demonstration Successful
     --------------------------------

     The Pilot was demonstrated at the NIST booth at Interop 92 Spring
     from May 20 through 22.  The demonstration setup consisted of an

     OSIWare DUA, running on a system in the convention hall, connected
     via Internet to the Custos Pilot DSA, running at NIST. The database
     was populated with telephone book data for NIST, GSA and NSF.
     Passers by were encouraged to suggest a Directory search or lookup,
     and various other Directory functions were demonstrated. The
     demonstration was successful in attracting a good deal of interest
     from government and industry representatives, with several
     representatives of federal agencies expressing interest in
     participating in the Pilot.

     NIST X.500 Implementation
     -------------------------

     May's efforts centered around preparation for the Custos
     demonstration at the Interop 92 Spring exhibition. The Custos DSA
     code was enhanced to enable the handling of the rfc822Mailbox
     attribute type, and thus the storage and retrieval of SMTP mail
     addresses of individuals whose records were to be used in the demo.
     We encountered some difficulties in running a SPARCstation
     compatible copy of the executable code for OSIWare's DUA, which we
     believe arose as a result of some misalignment between the shared
     runtime libraries available on the host system and those required
     by the DUA software. However, we were able interoperate without an
     appreciable loss of functionality. Some minor incompatibilities in
     data representations between Custos and OSIWare were ironed out and
     the database updated to reflect necessary changes.

     Future Plans
     ------------

     With the completion of the Interop demonstration, NIST will be
     formulating plans for the future of the Pilot.
