ANSNET
-------

     Network Status Summary
     =======================

     ANSnet total packet traffic decreased by about 6.44% in January '95.
     This decrease is attributable to the removal of NSFNET service
     traffic.  An increase in the ANSnet forwarding table size of 4.6% was
     observed during the month of January.

     January Backbone Traffic Statistics
     ===================================

     The total inbound packet count for the ANSnet (measured using SNMP
     interface counters) was 71,091,174,730 on T3 ENSS interfaces, down
     9.32% from December.  The total packet count into the network
     including all ENSS serial interfaces was 83,266,055,416 down 6.44%
     from December.

     Router Forwarding Table Statistics
     ==================================

     The maximum number of destinations announced to ANSnet during January
     was 21,186 up 4.6% from December.

     The NAP is operational, with traffic still in "experimental" mode due
     to problems experienced with the ATM DSUs. Below is a list of
     connected network providers, along with a "contingency plan"
     describing our steps to work around the DSU problems.

     Chicago NAP Contingency Plan Description

     The target configuration for the AADS Chicago NAP is ATM, at either
     DS3 or OC3c rates. However, due to a problem with the ATM DSU's
     being used, causing performance degradation, AADS is implementing
     an interim configuration. To allow the NSFNET transition traffic to
     be carried without performance problems, the MCI, ANS, and Sprint
     routers along with the Routing Arbiter's route server, will be
     connected via a local FDDI ring in the AADS Chicago facility. In
     order to implement this plan, the following steps are being taken:

     1. AADS has ordered 3 cisco 7010 routers with 1 FDDI and 2 HSSI
     cards; 3 DS3 CSU/DSUs; and 3 DS3 ATM DSUs. These will be installed
     in the switch room in Chicago. An additional FDDI card may be
     needed for the Route Server configuration to connect to the ring.

     2. The Sprint, ANS and MCI DS3 lines will be moved from the ATM
     switch to the HSSI ports on the routers; and the routers will be
     connected to each other via a local physical fiber FDDI ring. The
     Route Server Sun/Cisco can be connected to this ring.

     3. The second router HSSI port and ADSU for each would be connected
     to the ATM ports on the switch, allowing the routers to communicate
     both via FDDI and ATM.

     This will allow the NAP to come up right away using FDDI, and ATM
     connections to be used simultaneously.  NAP customers connected by

     ATM would be able to communicate with the FDDI NAP customers using
     these second ports.

     AADS does intend to continue to expedite testing and implementation
     of the new Kentrox ADSUs and ATM configuration. We intend for this
     FDDI contingency configuration to be used only as an interim plan
     until these problems are resolved.

     INTERNIC REGISTRATION SERVICES

     Progress Report for period January 1, 1995 through January 31, 1995

     I.  Significant Events

     InterNIC Registration Services assigned over 40,077 network
     addresses and registered over 4,099 domains.  Three top level
     domains were registered this month for Ghana (GH), Monaco (MC),
     and Nepal (NP).

     II.  Current Status

     During the month of January 1995, InterNIC Registration Services
     received communications as shown below.  The majority of the
     correspondence concerned the assignment and re-assignment of
     network numbers and the registration or change of domain names.

     ATOMIC-2

     ATOMIC-2 FILE SERVER PROGRESS

     We previously measured the performance of NFS and FTP over ATOMIC,
     and found (as expected) that the disk bandwidth is the bottleneck
     of each.  Prior measurements indicate that Ethernet performance is
     network-limited to 7-8 Mbps, but the ATOMIC LAN provides disk-
     limited 18 Mbps FTP and 19 Mbps NFS. Native packet memory-memory
     bandwidth over ATOMIC via the Myrinet API is 220 Mbps, TCP is 48
     Mbps, and UDP is 58 Mbps.

     We have been able to determine the limit of NFS in the absence of
     disk-limited bottlenecks, which remains near 20 Mbps, precluding
     NFS cache hits, which can increase read bandwidths to 275 Mbps.
     The bottleneck appears to be related to Sun RPC. The most efficient
     NFS is only slightly (5-10%) faster than the user-level RPC
     performance, possibly due to avoiding a kernel boundary swap. We
     are currently implementing a lightweight reliable transport
     mechanism, to be integrated into NFS.  It is related to a
     lightweight reliable transport mechanism being developed in the
     Netstation project.

     ATOMIC-2 GATEWAY PROGRESS

     We are currently designing a host-based gateway using Fore SBA-200
     ATM interfaces and Myrinet host interfaces, in a Sun SPARC 20/61
     platform.  Preliminary measurements indicate that the SPARC can
     route packets between these interfaces at rates limited by the IP
     bandwidth of the host interfaces themselves. We are investigating
     methods of increasing the IP bandwidth on these host interfaces
     individually. We are also using multiple interfaces to attempt to
     determine the routing capacity of the SPARC gateway.

     Work is continuing on our evaluation of the x-Kernel (Peterson,
     Arizona) as a possible vehicle for protocol experiments that bypass

Internet Monthly Report                                     January 1995


     the current BSD implementations of TCP/IP.  We have ported the ISI
     "blast" program, which measures TCP and UDP performance in memory-
     to-memory data transfers, to run as part of the x-Kernel.

     In SunOS 4.1.3, the blast gets 35 Mbps TCP in loopback mode. The
     same program in the X-Kernel measured only 3 Mbps. X-Kernel
     researchers are working with ISI to determine the cause of this
     performance gap. We are awaiting these results to determine whether
     the SunOS user-space X-Kernel environment is suitable for our
     host-based gateway design.

     ATOMIC-2 HIGH PERFORMANCE SECURITY ISSUES

     This month we submitted a paper to Sigcomm '95 entitled
     "Performance Analysis of MD5", based on our Internet Draft (IMR
     Nov. 1994). The draft is available at the usual places, including:
       ftp://ftp.isi.edu/internet-drafts/draft-touch-md5-performance-
     00.txt The submitted file is being held pending double-blind
     review, until April 7. Please contact touch@isi.edu for further
     information.

     Results indicate that a Dec Alpha (190 Mhz) can run MD5 at 87 Mbps.
     Previous reports of 100 Mbps on the Alpha relied on on-chip cache
     performance, i.e., that the data was preloaded and remained in the
     on-chip cache. Our measurements indicate that the following
     performance of manually-optimized code:

        MACHINE         CLOCK           MD5 RATE        IPv4
        --------------------------------------------------------------
        Dec Alpha       190 Mhz         87 Mbps         100 Mbps (TCP)
        SGI 4400        150 Mhz         51 Mbps
        Intel Pentium    66 Mhz         44 Mbps
        Sun 20/61        60 Mhz         38 Mbps         83 Mbps
        HP PA (Snake)    66 Mhz         33 Mbps

        (only some IPv4-related numbers are reported here)

     We also show analysis that indicates that this performance is
     within 10% of the upper-bound in software. We show a CMOS hardware
     design that can achieve 175 Mbps in a multi-chip (PLD) design, and
     400-600 Mbps in custom VLSI. Because these rates are lower than
     current IPv4 rates, we recommend that the inclusion of MD5 as a
     "required option" in IPv6 be reconsidered.

     ATOMIC-2 LAN INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION

     We have developed plans for the installation of a rich topology
     ATOMIC LAN to replace the Ethernet in all 63 HPCC Division Sun
     SPARCS. The topology uses 12 8-port switches in an overlapped 4-
     ring system, such that each host has two independent paths to the
     gateway, the primary path is no longer than 3 hops away, and the
     secondary is no longer than 5 hops away. The topology resembles the
     following (see Legend).  The spur "

     RSVP
     ----

     At the December IETF meeting in San Jose, we set a target of an
     early release of RSVP in January, 1995 and agreed on a list of
     features for this release.  We have released this version, RSVP
     version 2.01, on January 31 containing the following additional
     capabilities over the previous Multimedia '94 limited release.

     (1) API Version 2

         The first version of the RSVP spec defined a generic API that
         opened separate channels (Unix sockets) for sender and receiver.
         It was later realized that this API (known as version 1) was
         awkward and unnatural.  The latest RVSP spec defines a version 2



Cooper                                                         [Page 18]

Internet Monthly Report                                     January 1995


         API that uses a single channel between application and rsvpd.
         Version 2.01 supports API version 2.

     (2) UDP Encapsulation

         To ease installation of rsvpd on any host system, this release
         supports the UDP encapsulation of RSVP messages between host and
         the first-hop router.  It is expected that eventually all hosts
         which support multicasting will also support the normal raw mode
         for RSVP messages, and then UDP encapsulation will no longer be
         necessary.

     (3) Byte order code

         This release includes a version of "little-endian" byte-order code.

     (4) Data structure reorganization

         The data structure was reorganized to support immediate reduction
         of reservation levels and to simplify some of the algorithms.

     (5) Token Bucket Filter

         This version of rsvpd will invoke traffic policing, in the form of
         a Token Bucket Filter (TBF), at the first hop RSVP router and at
         every point where packets from multiple sources are mixed into a
         single reservation.  When multiple sources are mixed, the TBF that
         is applied is the "max" of the Tspecs defining the sources.

     (6) Merging

         Whenever two flowspecs are compared, there are five possible
         results: less, equal, greater, least-upper-bound (LUB), or
         incompatible.  The LUB case means that a third flowspec has been
         constructed that is "greater" than either of the comparands.  This
         version of rsvpd implements all these choices in an appropriate
         manner.

     A major revision of the RSVP protocol specification document was
     begun, to incorporate the changes agreed upon at the San Jose IETF
     meeting.  We hope to release the first draft of the new
     specification early in February.

     Steven Berson and Daniel Zappala wrote a note about a proposed
     solution to the self-regenerating property of wildcard filter
     reservations.  This problem causes reservations to remain in place
     even after all receivers have closed their reservations.  This
     solution would also apply to a similar problem with dynamic filter

MERIT/NSFNET ENGINEERING
------------------------

     This report summarizes recent activities of Merit's Internet
     Engineering and Network Management groups on behalf of the Routing
     Arbiter (RA) Project and the NSFNET Backbone Service Project.

     The Central Network Management System (CNMS) at the University of
     Michigan ROC is now performing preliminary monitoring of the Route
     Server at the Ameritech NAP, as well as the Route Servers at the
     PacBell NAP and on the MAE-East Ethernet.  All three Route Servers
     are now running the latest version of the Discovery Rover code,
     which will use a hybrid SNMPv1/v2 agent to monitor the NAPs.  The

Internet Monthly Report                                     January 1995


     Rover code will be modified regularly as the ROC and the RA staff
     gain experience with these new technologies.

     The RA Project's Route Server on the MAE-East Ethernet now has
     active sessions with six BGP peers: ANS, Alternet, Interpath,
     Netcom, Net99, and PIPEX.

     Merit has been working with AADS to develop a routing design for
     the contingency NAP's FDDI and ATM connections.

     The RA team has been translating Policy Routing Database data into
     a test Routing Arbiter Database (RADB) and generating test
     configuration files for the Route Servers.  The tool used for this
     purpose, known as "peval", was developed by Andy Adams of Merit and
     Cengiz Alaettinoglu of ISI.  Peval is now being used by CA*net to
     generate its production router configurations.

     Jessica Yu of Merit has been working closely with Internet Service
     Providers to collect information about their routing policies,
     enter the data into the test RADB, and use the data to test RADB
     policy analysis and configuration generation tools.

     MichNet, BARRNET, CICNet, SURAnet, and NEARNET have completed their
     transition from the NSFNET backbone service, and are obtaining
     interregional Internet service from MCInet.

     Ethernet interface problems caused ENSS 145 at FIX-East to go down
     towards the end of the month.  FIX-East is carrying more traffic
     than usual as regionals move off the ANS/NSFNET backbone and
     connect to alternate service providers.  FIX-East provides an
     interconnection between the service providers.

     As of January 23, Merit has begun to use an automated filter to
     check and sort incoming e-mail to nsfnet-admin@merit.edu.  The
     nsfnet-admin address is most commonly used for submitting Network
     Announcement Change Requests, or NACRs.  The filter implements the
     revised NACR procedures which were publicized in Merit's messages
     of Friday, January 13 to nwg@merit.edu and nanog@merit.edu.

     If the filter recognizes a message as containing a NACR, it checks
     it for syntactic accuracy.  If syntax checks are passed, the filter
     checks to make sure that the NACR's submitter is authorized for the
     primary or home AS of every net contained in the NACR.  If any of
     the checks are failed, the NACR is bounced and never processed.  If
     all checks succeed, Merit is able to give the NACR quicker
     handling.  The process of submitting NACRs which can be
     automatically checked is somewhat analogous to using ZIP+4 and bar
     coding on your paper mail -- it lets us handle it more quickly and

     accurately.

     During the first day the filter was in use, several bugs were found
     and corrected.  No NACRs were lost as a result of the bugs, though
     several spurious "bounce" messages were sent.  We now believe that
     the filter code is quite stable.

     The Merit config staff's workload has already decreased
     substantially as a result of the automatic checking and sorting of
     incoming NACRs.  We expect that this will help us keep up with the
     greatly increased number of NACRs we have been receiving as a
     result of the NSFNET transition.

     For the most part, NACR submitters seem to have adapted quite
     easily to submitting NACRs which will be automatically pre-
     processed.  The two most common problems we have observed are:

     - NACRs submitted from unauthorized persons or unauthorized
       accounts.

       It's important to note that Merit's authorization database lists
       contacts by e-mail address and performs validation the same way.
       In the past, when humans did the validation, they were able to
       figure out that foo@ws1.bletch.com was the same as
       foo@bletch.com. The filter doesn't do this -- as a result, you
       must be more careful to submit NACRs from your registered e-mail
       address, or to register the one you will be using.

     - NACRs missing required fields.

       The required fields are listed in the NACR specification
       available in:

       ftp://nis.nsf.net/nsfnet/announced.networks template.net.README

       However, if you are submitting a change you need only list the
       changed fields and if you are submitting a delete you need only
       list the netnums you wish to delete from the PRDB. The action
       field is always required.

     Some suggestions for NACR submitters:

     - Check your authorized submitters list (using "whois -h
       prdb.merit.edu contact <your-AS-number>") and update it if need
       be, before you have a NACR rejected for lack of authorization.

     - Submit your NACRs as early as possible.

Internet Monthly Report                                     January 1995


     - If possible, when a NACR is bounced, fix the problem and resubmit
       it so that it can be automatically parsed, instead of using the
       "dont- parse" flag.  If you do this, your NACR will be spooled
       with the "good NACRs," which are given priority handling.

     - Don't "quote" NACRs with characters down the left side of the
       message, unless you want to hide them from the filter.  If you
       send in a quoted NACR, it will not be given priority handling.

     - When a network changes service providers, either a representative
       of the network's Home AS or a representative of the OLD service
       provider typically must submit the NACR for the change.  This
       might be accomplished by the new service provider filling out a
       NACR and sending it to one of the above for forwarding to
       nsfnet-admin.  (But note the warning about "quote" characters in
       NACRs.)

NORTHWESTNET
------------

     The NorthWestNet User Services Committee met via teleconference on
     January 19th. The topic of the conversation was "The Help Desk."
     The session was moderated by Vicki Pengelly, Information Systems
     Specialist at the University of Montana.  Attendees represented a
     broad range of organizations including higher ed, business, health
     care, public libraries, and regional networks. Despite this
     diversity, there was no problem among the participants in relating
     to the frustrations and challenges posed by offering a help desk
     service.  Issues compared and discussed included support lists
     (products that fall within the scope of the Help Desk), non-support
     lists (items that are specifically *not* supported), hours of
     service, staffing, staff education and professional development,
     referral processes, problem tracking, marketing or awareness
     building for the service, transitional challenges (mainframe to
     desktop systems; stand-alone computers to Internet-connected
     computers; "esoteric" applications to the "every day"
     applications), dispersed vs. centralized services, and techniques
     to get the users to access non-human support resources such as
     manuals and online databases. The meeting succeeded in highlighting
     the major issues associated with development and management of a
     Help Desk service.

     NorthWestNet's in-house training program proceeded on schedule this
     month. For more information on NorthWestNet services and products:

     We have written a unix decoder for the recently announced
     experiemntal PC Video conferencing tool from FTP software. We may
     integrate this with NV or Vic depending on the takeup for the PC
     end. We can operate the receiver as multicast, or using the CuSeeMe
     style requestor (Can I See Request) approach.

     We have done quite a bit of work on a Photo-server from INRIA,
     applying the ideas of Application Layer Framing and Integrated
     Layer Processing - the speedup is immense, but this is not really
     the interesting result so much as the set of implementation tricks
     (aka techniques). A paper on this has been submitted to the IFIP
     conference on High Speed Protocols.
