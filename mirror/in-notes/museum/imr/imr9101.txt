     IETF Report for January 1991

     Contents:

         1. IETF Meeting (March 11-15 in St. Louis)
         2. Area Reports
         3. New IETF Working Groups and Documents for January 1991

     1. IETF Meeting (March 11-15 in St. Louis)

     The IETF will hold its next meeting in St. Louis (March 11-15,
     1991).  "At-A-Glance" logistics information is included below.  For
     more information, please contact Megan Davies
     (mdavies@nri.reston.va.us).

     I want to take this opportunity to remind prospective attendees of
     one change in our normal planning for this (and future) meetings --
     we will be asking for an attendance fee to help offset some costs



Westine                                                         [Page 3]

Internet Monthly Report                                     January 1991


     of the meeting.

     The IETF is an open technical meeting,  not a "conference".  Local
     expenses for all past IETF meetings have been been paid for either
     by the local host or through U.S. government funding.  When the
     IETF meetings were smaller this was workable, but as the meetings
     grew in size, the U.S. government expressed a desire for IETF
     participants to share a portion of the meeting costs.  Therefore,
     beginning with this IETF meeting, we are asking attendees to defray
     some IETF meeting costs directly.  It is our sincere hope that this
     new policy does not affect attendance at IETF meetings.  Please
     contact Phill GrosS or Megan Davies (703-620-8990,
     mdavies@nri.reston.va.us), if you encounter any difficulties.

     Regular IETF attendees will recall that we have discussed this
     issue as early as the February 1990 open plenary at FSU.  At the
     December 1990 meeting in Boulder, we announced that this new policy
     would start with the St. Louis meeting.

     Further details will be provided in announcements to the IETF
     mailing list (send to ietf-request@isi.edu to join).  However,
     there are a few more important issues to mention here.

     - IMPORTANCE OF EARLY HOTEL AND IETF REGISTRATION: It will be
     important for folks to send their reistration forms and checks to
     CNRI (and to make their room reservations with the hotel) by
     February 22nd.  There are 3 reasons for this. 1) The hotel offers
     discounted rates for both the hotel rooms and the meeting rooms,
     but it is based on filling an early hotel "block".  The "block"
     closes on Feb 22nd.  Therefore, you can help reduce your costs and
     the overall meeting costs if you make your hotel room reservation
     and your attendance reservation by Feb 22nd.  It turns out the IETF
     has not had a good record in the past of filling early hotel
     "blocks".  It will help to keep costs down if we can establish a
     better record of early hotel registrations. 2) It is very helpful
     for the logistics planning (eg, refreshments, setting up meeting
     rooms in "classroom" or "theatre" style, etc) if we have a good
     idea of the number of attendees in advance. 3) It will help reduce
     the onsite registration hassles and delays if most of the stuff is
     taken care of for most attendees before the meeting.  Since this is
     the first meeting in which fees will be required, we have no
     experience with how this might increase onsite registration delays.

        Note:  Make your hotel room reservation directly with the hotel.
        Make your attendance reservation by returning the registration
        form to CNRI.





Westine                                                         [Page 4]

Internet Monthly Report                                     January 1991


     All these requirements will be satisfied if prospective attendees
     have booked the hotel room by the Feb 22nd cutoff date, and if they
     have returned a completed registration form to CNRI by the Feb 22nd
     cutoff date.  Therefore, under these conditions, we will be happy
     to accept the regular attendance fee onsite.

     - REFUND POLICY: We will give a full refund for cancellations or
     no-shows. Those who cancel or no-show would not receive
     Proceedings, of course, but can arrange to purchase separately if
     they wish.

     - CREDIT CARDS: We do not yet have the final arrangements in place
     to accept credit cards.  Therefore, for this first meeting, I must
     ask that attendees arrange for payment by check.  We fully expect
     to be able to accept credit cards by the July IETF meeting in
     Atlanta.

     The IETF has come a long way since our initial 15 person meeting
     five years ago.  Its growth and successes have come from the
     support of a wide community of network operators, users, vendors,
     and researchers. This special blend of attendees makes the IETF a
     unique development group.  I intend to make every effort to
     maintain that important and distinctive blend of contributors.

     2. Area Reports

     --- User Services Area Report (January 1991) - Joyce K. Reynolds

     New Working Group Announcements -

     Internet User Glossary Working Group (userglos) Chaired by Karen
     Roubicek and Tracy LaQuey Parker

        A new working group was announced this month via the IETF
        mailing list.  The User-Gloss Working Group is chartered to
        create an Internet glossary of networking terms and acronyms for
        the Internet community.  We are also pleased to announce that
        Tracy LaQuey Parker will be joining Karen Roubicek as co-chair
        of this working group.  This group will meet at the IETF in St.
        Louis.

     NOC-Tool Catalogue Revisions Working Group (noctool2) Chaired by
     Robert Enger and Gary Malkin

        The start up of the this working group was announced at the IETF
        in Boulder.  A new charter is in place, and the "Son of
        NOCTools" was announced this month via the IETF mailing list.
        Unfortunately, Bob Stine has announced he would be unable to

        carry on with the NOCTools project as he previously intended.
        On behalf of the IETF, we thank Bob for his time, dedication,
        and efforts on the NOCTools catalogue.  We are pleased to
        announce Bob Enger will continue as chair of NOCTools, with Gary
        Malkin joining Bob as co-chair in this effort.  The first
        meeting of this group will be at the IETF in St. Louis.

     Working Group Reports -

     NISI - Chaired by Dana Sitzler

        The "Building a Network Information Services Infrastructure"
        draft document was expanded to more accurately define and
        describe a NIC, with the ultimate goal intended to make it
        easier for users to get information from NICs.

     SSPHWG - Chaired by J. Paul Holbrook and Joyce K. Reynolds

        The draft document is in the hands of the SSPHWG editors and is
        undergoing rework per the corrections/suggestions provided at
        the SSPHWG session in Boulder.

     USWG - Chaired by Joyce K. Reynolds

        The Quail documents, "FYI on Questions and Answers - Answers to
        Commonly asked "New Internet User" Questions", and "FYI on
        Questions and Answers - Answers to Commonly asked "Experienced
        Internet User" Questions", are continuing to undergo rework per
        the corrections/suggestions provided at the USWG session in
        Boulder.  Additional writing is continuing on the installation
        checklist, based on input from IETF members at Boulder.

     --- Applications Area (January 1991) - Russ Hobby

     The Resource Location Working Group now has a chair, John Veizades
     (Apple).  John is writing the WG charter and is getting the group
     into operation.  Two new Working Groups, SMTP and Network
     Calendaring (Chronos), have started have been seen a lot of
     activity.

     The SMTP WG, chaired by Greg Vaudreuil (CNRI), has had extensive
     discussion on what direction to take in improving SMTP and RFC 822
     formatting.  There needs to be a balance between simple goals that
     can be done quickly and goals that will meet all needs for the near
     future.  Another concern is convergence with X.400.

     The Distributed Scheduling WG, chaired by Paul Lindner (UMN) has
     made a lot of progress in defining the Chronos Protocol used for

Internet Monthly Report                                     January 1991


     remote calendar scheduling.  Paul has had several revisions of the
     document based on the discussion on the mail list.

     Another area of interest is standard formatting of text, images,
     and audio to be used in documents and general information exchange.
     This is critical for multimedia in email and other applications.  A
     working groups has been started in the OSI Area to look at Office
     Document Architecture (ODA) on the Internet.  Will ODA meet all the
     needs for multimedia applications?

     Terrestrial Wideband Network (TWBNet) and ST/IP Gateway
     -------------------------------------------------------

     During January, work continued on the new "southern loop" to be
     added to the TWBNet.  A Wideband Packet Switch (WPS) was installed
     in Albuquerque and connected to the Mobile WPS.  The next steps
     will be to connect up a gateway at Los Alamos National Lab, and set
     up a circuit between the Albuquerque WPS and the Los Angeles WPS.
     The addition of this southern path will provide added robustness in
     the form of an alternate route between the east and west coasts and
     will also allow shorter tail circuits to Southern sites.

     A new ST/IP gateway was installed at the Warrior Preparation Center
     (WPC, Ramstein AFB, Germany).  The WPC-ST gateway is connected to
     the TWBNet node at BBN via a 256 Kbps circuit, and supports
     multimedia video conferencing between WPC and other DARPA
     conferencing sites.

     There were eleven video conferences and three demos.  There were
     eight point-to-point conferences, two 3-site conferences, and one
     4-site conference.  The demos were all point-to-point.  Of note,
     UCL participated in five of the connections.  Conferences were held
     for the following areas: DARPA Planning and Scheduling Program,
     DWSNET, and the ICB meeting.  Participants included, Mark Pullen,
     Ira Richer, Paul Mockapetris, Peter Kirstein, Danny Cohen, Jon
     Postel and Bob Braden.

     This month, a new conferencing gateway was added at BBN.  This
     gateway is being used to support 4-way conferencing with the high
     quality PictureTel codec.  Since the PictureTel is designed to
     support two way, point-to-point conferences, this new gateway was
     needed to serve as a hub for supporting multi-site conferences
     using this codec.  Video and audio traffic comes in from 4 sites
     via 4 point-to-point connections.  The gateway then mixes the video
     and audio from these 4 sources and sends the mixed data back out on
     the point-to-point connections.  Two 3-way conferences were
     supported by this new gateway.

     Inter-Domain Policy Routing
     ---------------------------

     During January, work on IDPR continued on at least three different
     fronts.  At this time, one of the most important actions for the
     IDPR working group is to complete several small tasks in
     preparation for submitting the IDPR protocols into the IETF
     standards process.  Some working group members have already taken
     on some of these tasks; however, several tasks are still
     outstanding.  We plan to hold a video conference in February to
     determine who will do the as yet unclaimed tasks.

     The IDPR development team with members from SAIC, USC, and BBN has
     done a great job with the prototype.  Each of the development team
     member sites is pursuing experiments on their own networks.  We are
     also planning experiments over the Internet among the three sites.
     This will give us the ability to construct non-trivial
     interconnections between administrative domains.  It is exciting to
     see the protocols operate in "real" networks.  Now that BBN has
     become a fully operational DARTNET site, thanks to the efforts of
     Walt Prue of ISI and the BBN group led by Karen Seo, we can now
     proceed with the DARTNET experiments that we have been alluding to
     over the past several months.

     BBN is also pursuing the "research" topic of policy-based resource
     allocation: a combination of policy-based routing, resource
     reservation, and flow control.  Currently, we are surveying what
     has been done previously in this area, including the work of the
     COIP working group of the IETF.

CSUNET
------

     CSUnet (The California State University network) interconnects all
     of the twenty CSU campuses across the State of California and
     supports their special instructional and administrative needs.
     CSUnet is established to benefit the State of California
     educational arena.

     With that in mind, the upper level management has ongoing talks
     with the State of California Department of Education (K-12) (DOE)
     to establish projects that allow students and administrative bodies
     to utilize the resources and connectivity of CSUnet.  That activity
     has brought about some projects with DOE that now use CSUnet.  In
     addition, the California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office and
     the CSU have begun a joint venture to connect some of the

     California Community Colleges.

     Currently, X.25, TCP/IP, DECnet, AppleTalk, and SNA are supported
     across CSUnet.  We cooperatively working together with Calinet
     (California Internet Federation) to provide backup routing for the
     BARRnet, CERFnet, and Los Nettos regional networks.

     The original funding for the IP routers (cisco systems routers) in
     CSUnet came from NSF through CERFnet.  All of the operating costs
     are paid by State of California funds controlled by the California
     State University Chancellor's Office.

     CSUnet is conducting an upgrade of the entire network spanning over
     the next one to two years.  The backbone will shortly be upgraded
     (1st and 2nd quarter 1991) to T-1 speeds (1544Mbps) with upgrades
     to existing links following in by groups thereafter.

FARNET
-------

     On January 14-15, 1991 FARNET members attended the quarterly
     meeting held at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

     The main purpose of the meeting was to discuss what role FARNET
     should play in the networking community.  Representatives of the
     consulting firm hired by FARNET, Northeast Consulting Resources,
     Inc., attended the meeting. The counsulting service was hired by
     FARNET to assist the organization to develop avision for the future
     of FARNET and a strategic plan for attaining that vision.Final
     report is to be submitted to the Strategic Planning Committee in
     February.

     Elections for Vice President were held to fill the vacancy left by
     the resignation of Joel Maloff.  A Board of Directors was also
     voted in.  The complete FARNET Board is as follows:

                           President-Glenn Ricart
                           Vice President-Susan Estrada
                           Treasurer-Bill Yundt

     GIGABIT

     This month was partially spent looking into issues that involve
     FDDI, in preparation for the ordering of hardware and subsequent
     installation of a small FDDI network at ISI.  This involved
     discussions with SUN salesman, pricing, reading related FDDI
     papers, and so on.  Another subject of study was an investigation
     of ATOMIC for the new GIGA contract.  In particular, gathering and
     reading papers related to MOSAIC.

     Jon Postel hosted the IAB, IESG meetings and Bob Braden hosted the
     FEPG (Federal Engineering Planning Group) meeting at ISI, January
     7-10, 1991.

     Three RFCs were published this month.

        RFC 1170: Fougner, R., "Public Key Standards and Licenses",
                  Public Key Partners, January 1991.

     MULTIMEDIA CONFERENCING PROJECT

     This month we successfully interoperated both packet voice and
     packet video between the SPARC and the Butterfly implementations of
     the VT (voice) and PVP (video) programs.  The Butterflies are part
     of the existing multimedia conferencing system and the SPARC is the
     first of several new platforms to be used for workstation
     conferencing.  The enabling event was the installation of an ST
     gateway with IP encapsulation capability on the Butterfly at ISI.

Internet Monthly Report                                     January 1991


     The VT test included a 3-way connection with two Butterfly VTs at
     RIACS and BBN to test sound mixing in the SPARC VT at ISI.  The PVP
     test was with PictureTel codecs between ISI and BBN.  Both programs
     implemented software byte-swapping of the data to compensate for
     the swapping done by the I/O interface on the Butterfly.  We still
     need to measure performance quantitatively, but the basic
     functionality looks good.

     We are making the VT program available to other researchers who
     want to experiment with packet voice.  The VT source code is
     available via anonymous FTP; "vt.101.tar.Z" is located on
     "venera.isi.edu" in the "pub" directory.  The version number, e.g.
     "101", will be updated as changes and additions are made.

     A new release of the Butterfly version of PVP, the video packet
     host, was made which incorporates a number of previously mentioned
     enhancements plus: the ability to select data streams for display
     on the video monitor of sites specified in HCP (Host Control
     Protocol) messages; response to ICMP (Internet Control Message
     Protocol) inquiries; multiple PVPs in the same Butterfly machine;
     and a safety mechanism to prevent packet congestion in case of
     codec malfunction.

     In the future, we plan to scale up packet video to high-definition
     images.  Steve Casner made a presentation on this topic at the
     Information Exchange Conference on High-Definition Systems at
     DARPA.  Scaling up the number of sites is another challenge: As an
     aside to the IESG meeting at ISI, that group was given a demo of
     BBN's MMConf shared worskpace, and the members expressed the desire
     to hold teleconference meetings with as many as 15 participants all
     running MMConf.

     Eve Schooler attended the 24th Hawaii International Conference on
     System Sciences where she presented the invited paper, "Multimedia
     Conferencing: Has it come of age?", by Schooler, Casner and Postel.

     The first issue of Megabytes has been published and distributed to
     our mailing list.  Send email to megabytes-request@jvnc.net to
     place your name on our list.  We are interested in having our
     readers express their views, comments, and suggestions about
     Megabytes.

     The JvNCnet Regional Meeting took place on January 25, 1991 at
     Princeton University. Dr. Jane Caviness, NSF Deputy Director, Dr.
     Anthony Villasenor, Director of the NASA Science Internet, John
     Clement, Educational Consultant at EDUCOM, Ann Robertson, Director
     of Computing at Mitchell College, New London, Connecticut, and John
     Hagan, Senior Network Engineer at the University of Pennsylvania
     formed our panel of guest speakers. The meeting's focus
     concentrated on why and how the pre-college curriculum may derive
     significant benefit by incorporating the regional and national
     computer network matrix. Utilizing computer networks may raise
     students' scholarship and revitalize and strengthen all disciplines
     in the curriculum.  Advanced data communications technology may be
     the unconventional instrument to focus or sharpen a student's
     interest in learning and for recognizing the value of intellectual
     challenges. Speakers also addressed the potential that networking
     may provide such as accessing and collecting information and
     references, launching novel educational and instructional
     opportunities, forging and maintaining electronic partnerships and
     communication internally and with outside elementary and secondary
     schools, colleges and industry.

     The broad issues of how networking appears to be a compatible fit
     into the NREN big picture was another highlight.  Some specific
     enhancements and innovative programs developed using networking and
     its spectrum of resources were detailed.

     JvNCnet group leaders conducted parallel work sessions to elicit
     dialog among members about operations, information services,
     engineering, and installation.  Participants collaborated on
     specific subjects which may lead to networking enhancements for
     members and their end-users.

     Rounding off the meeting, attendees listened to a descriptive

     account of networking at the University of Pennsylvania campus.
     Throughout the day, we had the developer of a new Hypertext
     application for locating and reviewing RFCs, their corrections and
     updates, present a demonstration.  Currently the software operates
     on a PC386 with Microsoft Windows 3 and a Macintosh- compatible
     version is planned.

     JvNCnet statistics and other operational data are available from
     the monthly reports via anonymous ftp on nisc.jvnc.net.

     Engineering reconfigurations have improved the performance of the
     BNSs located in New Haven, Boston, Providence, Philadelphia, and
     Newark.  Each BNS was consolidated from three routers to one
     router.  One router is configured to attach to both backbone links.
     Overflow from the backbone router will transfer to another router.
     Currently there are five DS1 circuits and six DS0 circuits going
     into the Newark BNS.

     JvNCnet's backbone upgrade is currently in progress.  Its purpose
     is three-fold:   To  reduce the diameter  (number of hops) of the
     JvNCnet backbone by reconfiguring the links on the routers; to
     improve switching performance by upgrading the routers to CSC3
     processors;  and to minimize operating costs by relocating POPs
     based on geographic location.

     NEARnet now uses a shared network segment at Princeton consisting
     of an Ethernet multiport provided by JvNCnet.  It allows direct
     peering with a separate E-PSP. This is an interim measure until the
     Boston NSS becomes operational.  The result has reduced the traffic
     load to the JvNCnet backbone.  Traffic between JvNCnet and NEARnet
     does not go through the E-PSP but rather through one of JvNCnet
     routers bridging JvNCnet and the shared segment.

     A filter has been placed on all JvNCnet border gateways to ensure
     that JvNCnet traffic will not flow through an announced peer NSFnet
     route with a very low metric.

     JvNCnet is currently offering a very exciting new access option for
     dial up users.   Dialin'Tiger provides terminal access, SLIP
     connectivity, up to 19.2kbps bandwidth,  access to the Internet
     from the cities of Philadelphia, Trenton, Princeton, New York, New
     Haven, Newark, Providence, and Boston.  A Dialin'Tiger user
     receives an account on tigger.jvnc.net, a dedicated platform for
     additional applications.  For further information send email to
     nisc@nisc.jvnc.net.

     At the January Board meeting, revised By-laws reflecting the name
     change from Merit Computer Network to Merit Network, Inc., and
     MichNet (for the statewide network) were distributed. Copies of
     Merit's Acceptable Use policy with final changes were also
     distributed; this policy is available for anonymous FTP on the
     machine NIC.Merit.edu, or by mail inquiry to nis-info@NIC.Merit.edu
     (type HELP as the message text to receive instructions).

     At this same board meeting, new officers were elected: Dr. Morteza
     Rahimi of Wayne State University as chair, Dr. Paul Hunt of
     Michigan State as vice chair,Dr. Robert DeBruin of Central Michigan
     University as secretary, and Harvey Behmof Western Michigan
     University as treasurer.

     In January Merit/MichNet released user authentication software
     called the Authorization Server. When a user attempts to telnet out
     of the MichNet mid-level network, the Authorization Server asks for
     a user ID and password on a trusted host, so that MichNet can track
     which user connected to which Internet host. This was needed
     because MichNet users, including thousands of users who dial in to
     the network, can connect to telnet and other services without
     having to first log in to a host. In a future enhancement, the
     Authorization Server will allow MichNet to charge for services that
     don't have any charging facilities of their own.

MITRE Corporation
-----------------

     Shari Galitzer and Walt Lazear visited GTE Spacenet's net
     monitoring center on 29 January, where they received detailed
     briefings on GTE's network design techniques, satellite management
     center, and communications services management center.  Judy
     Messing, Shari, and Walt attended a demo of Compression Labs'
     videoconferencing product line to identify the state of the art in
     low cost videoconferencing.

     Their approach to multipoint conferencing is to have sites call a
     central hub (using switched 56kb) that coordinates the conference
     (who sees whom) at about $40-50k per site.  However, their point to
     point videophone (made for ATT) that will give full motion color
     over home phone lines will go for $1500.  This product is due out
     later this year.

     Several MITRE staff participated in a detailed tour of the DCA Net
     Management Center.  Ray Butler and Dan O'Brien gave a thorough tour
     of the DSNET, MILNET, help desk, and computer room facilities.
     This tour was highly instructive and showed how DCA is upgrading
     their facilities, while battling with older technologies.

     Several demonstrations were given during the month: Forrest Palmer
     and Walt demonstrated SunNet Manager and Cisco NetCentral software
     to DCA operations, engineering, and program personnel.  The demo
     was well received and resulted in direct impact on selection of a
     monitoring package for the T1 pilot network.  Shari demonstrated
     the BBN- developed MultiMedia Conferencing software to DCEC sponsor
     personnel.  The result of our interest to apply MMCONF to network
     problem-solving has resulted in renewed BBN support.  Another MITRE
     group presented a briefing about the DCA Pacific demo of ATT's
     Accumaster net management integration product.  The demo is showing
     how a graphic user interface can be used to monitor (but not
     control) existing proprietary systems (circuit switches and
     transmission media).

     Walt and Forrest began to work out the allocation of Testbed
     resources.  Experiments being scheduled for use of the Testbed
     include JTC3A (MITRE multicast simulation), DCEC (SAIC IDPR
     testing), IETF (MITRE congestion avoidance and X.400 Pilot), DCEC
     (net management), DIA (MITRE net simulation), and JDSSC (MITRE NICS

NSF BACKBONE (Merit)
-------------------

     The inbound packet count for the T1 NSFNET backbone during January
     1991 totaled 5,867,911,410 packets, an increase of 21.92% over the
     December 1990 total of 4,812,968,474 packets.  As of January 29th,
     2331 networks are configured for announcement on the NSFNET
     backbone.

     With the continued growth in traffic, the partnership has been
     monitoring the effects of increasing loads on each of the T1
     backbone nodes.  A change was made to the external interface of the
     T1 backbone node at College Park, MD to improve performance and
     split the traffic load.  Additionally, external interfaces at
     Ithaca, NY and Palo Alto, CA have been upgraded to improve
     performance at those sites.

     T3 hardware and circuit installations are complete at six nodes:
     Ann Arbor, MI; Cambridge, MA; Palo Alto, CA; Pittsburgh, PA; San
     Diego, CA and Urbana-Champaign, IL.  During January, plans to

     A new award from the National Science Foundation to Merit Network,
     Inc. will allow for the expansion of T3 service to all of the
     current NSFNET backbone sites not already part of the first T3
     phase.  The eight additional T3 sites are Atlanta, GA; Boulder, CO;
     College Park, MD; Houston, TX; Lincoln, NE; Princeton, NJ; Salt
     Lake City, UT and Seattle, WA.

     Successful interoperability testing of an FDDI interface for the T3
     technology with Proteon routers and DEC DS 5000s has taken place.
     FDDI will allow for a 100 Mbps lan interface.

     As the NSFNET matures, becoming a largely operational environment,
     Hans-Werner Braun decided to leave his position at Merit to focus
     on networking issues of a more advanced research nature.  In mid-
     January, he moved to SDSC to initially work on the CASA very-high-
     speed communications network research project, part of the CNRI
     gigabit testbed initiative, as a Co-PI.  Eric Aupperle, President
     of Merit Network, Inc., has temporarily assumed administrative
     responsibility for the Internet Engineering group at Merit,
     formerly managed by Braun.

     Guests at the Merit Network Operations Center included
     representatives from U.S. Sprint and Cornell University, who will
     be jointly managing the international connections to INRIA and
     NORDUnet.

     Eric Aupperle represented the NSFNET project at the FARNET meeting
     held in Los Vegas, Nevada.  Elise Gerich of Merit/NSFNET Internet
     Engineering, was its representative to a meeting of the FEPG in Los
     Angeles.

     Another in the series of Merit Networking Seminars presented by
     Merit/NSFNET Information Services is being planned for mid-May in
     Ann Arbor, MI.  Continuing the commitment to provide current
     information on national networking, the program will focus on
     issues of interest to campus computing leaders, information systems
     and networking administrators, educational liaisons, librarians and
     educators who want to learn more about national networking.
     Program details will be available soon; electronic inquiries may be
     made to seminar@merit.edu or phone 1-800-66-MERIT.

SAN DIEGO SUPERCOMPUTER CENTER
------------------------------

     During the month, the most significant item was the installation of
     2 FDDI rings.  A production ring created by upgrading our Network
     Systems HyperChannel100 equipment to FDDI interfaces.  A new, third
     box was added to provided FDDI connections for systems with
     existing NSC low speed connections (PI-xxx cards).Thus our
     production FDDI ring connects to our Cray, our IBM, and 4 VME/VAX
     typeconnections via NSC equipment.

     The second ring was completed by connecting the FDDI card in out
     NSFnet T3 router with cards in two of our larger SUN's.  These
     later cards were loaned to SDSC by the local SUN office to assist
     with the testing of the T-3 FDDI interface. At this time, testing
     continues.

     A FDDI concentrator from DEC is awaited any day.  This will be used
     in our expanded ring.

     A long ordered NSC VME interface was received and connected into a
     SUN which will be used as a FTP gateway to DataTree.  Our NCUBE's
     frontend SUN has also been connected to a low speed port into the
     FDDI ring via a NSC interface card loaned by CRI.

     During Jan we gatewayed over 150,000 mail messages through our
     SoftwareTools mail software.

SESQUINET
---------

     January saw several technical and operational developments in
     Sesquinet.  Firstwas the bringing up of our connection to the NASA
     Science Internet.  There is now a (Proteon) NSI router on the same
     ethernet that includes the Houston NSFnet Backbone router (NSS-11)
     and several Sesquinet routers.  This NSI routeris connected to a
     neighboring NSI router at the Johnson Space Center via a T1
     circuit.  This connection will both provide a direct connection
     between Sesquinet and NSI and will improve the performance of
     access to the NSFnet Backbone by NASA users at JSC.

     A second development was the upgrading of our hub routers at Dallas
     and Houstonto cisco AGS+ configurations.

     Recent connections to Sesquinet include Teledyne Geotech, Mobil,
     and Clear LakeHigh School.

     One notable transient this month was our one-week support for T1
     connections from both the Uniforum and Usenix conferences in
     Dallas.  Circuits and equipment all performed well and came up
     smoothly.

SRI

     SRI NIC

     During the month of January, the Internet Registry (IR) at SRI
     assigned 385 IP network numbers.  The total of all IP numbers
     assigned is now 26,537.  The total number of assigned Autonomous
     System numbers (ASNs) is now 1,217.

     We have been working closely with NSF and Merit personnel to ensure
     uninterrupted service for those networks that may have been
     negatively affected by DDN Management Bulletin #80.  Although they
     no longer recognize the concept of "connected" versus "unconnected"
     status IP numbers and the notion that U.S. Government sponsorship
     is necessary for networks, NSF has agreed to grant sponsorship to
     all IP networks that were assigned during the period of time that
     RFC 1174 procedural changes were in effect.

     There are currently a total of 2,322 registered domains which
     includes 59 at the top level, 2,244 at the second level, and 19
     third-level MIL domains.

     FOX Project

     As a precursor to interoperability experimentation, we obtained and
     installed prerequisite software on various Sun Workstations at SRI.

     ISODE 6.0 and QUIPU were installed.  A DSA representing SRI and the
     Network Information Systems Center was created.  This DSA, named
     San Joaquin Kit Fox, has joined the White Pages Pilot Project.

     NIST's X.500 implementation (Custos) was also installed.  SRI is
     the first group outside of the NIST to compile and run Custos,
     hence, thanks are due to the folks at NIST for their support while
     working through a few difficulties.  We are creating a DSA that
     stores SRI and NISC information.  These two DSAs will form the
     basis for initial interoperability tests.

     SRI will host the third meeting of the IETF Directory Services
     Working Group on February 12-13.

     Washington.

     A new researcher has started work on analysing traffic patterns on
     the UK-US "Fat Pipe" link in the presence and absence of video

     traffic.  Prelimary results show the bandwidth sharing scheme on
     the link works well and that we are lucky that most contemporary
     TCP implementations are "well behaved". Almost all retransmissions
     are at the beginning of connnections due to default initial timers
     being low for the path.  The sooner the RTT estimate is cached in
     the routing table, the better.

     [Last month we ommitted to report that S. Kille; had attended the
     IETF and attended an OSI Directory Working Group meeting - this
     group is now very active].

     We are currently measuring IP performance over JANET links from
     London to other UK sites, with a view to extending the conferencing
     facility. This will, of course, take some time.

UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE
----------------------


     1.   Usage of the Fuzzball NTP primary time servers has been
          escalating to the point that the claimed millisecond accuracy
          has recently been degrading. A number of changes were made to
          the fuzzware encryption and queueing code in hopes of
          reversing that trend.  Happily, the result is that the
          pristine millisecond tick has been restored.

     2.   The recent fuzzware changes do not necessarily bring joy in
          future, since every indication is that the load on the
          NSFnet-centric fuzzballs and probably the other primary time
          servers will continue to increase. To offset some of that
          trend, the fuzzware was further amended to restrict access in
          certain cases. Details are provided in a message sent to the
          NTP interest group.

     3.   A preliminary investigation into the timekeeping accuracy and
          stability of clocks synchronized over T1 facilities such as
          DARTnet has been completed. The results, distributed to the
          DARTnet interest group, confirm that time transfer using IP
          over such facilities, at least for low to moderate traffic
          loads, can provide accuracy to a millisecond and stability to
          a millisecond per day.

     4.   Erik Perkins, Mike Davis and Dave Mills attended a DARTnet
          teleconference in deprived-video mode.

WISCNET
-------

     Circuit installation started on 1/15/91 with T1 lines from the five
     backbone sites to the State of Wisconsin Department of
     Administration T1 network.  The first backbone sites were running
     on 1/17/91 while the whole backbone was up on 1/22/91.
     Installation of the 16 end node 56k DDS sites started on 1/17 with
     the first site operational 1/17.  The remaining sites were
     installed during the rest of January (as of 1/29/91 two sites are
     not yet operational).

     All sites now have Internet access through UW-Madison's CICNet
     connection.

     Work for next month includes moving connectivity for UW-Milwaukee,
     UW-Parkside, and Marquette University from the current 56K DDS link
     to NCSA to WiscNet.  Current dedicated BITNet links will be dropped
     and moved to JNet DECNet sessions.

     All sites are busy installing name servers, mail routing, and mail
     user agents.

     The user services committee is well along with development of model
     documentation and plans to distribute it next month.  A series of
     meetings with site user consulting staff are planned.

     Draft information aimed at possible new members and a draft
     membership agreement have been written.
