INTERNET MONTHLY REPORTS
------------------------

The purpose of these reports is to communicate to the Internet Research
Group the accomplishments, milestones reached, or problems discovered by
the participating organizations.

Each organization is expected to submit a 1/2 page report on the first
business day of the month describing the previous month's activities.
These reports should be submitted via network mail to "IMR-ED@ISI.EDU".

The Internet Monthly Report mailing list is now managed by MajorDomo at
ISI.EDU.  The announcements of new issues on the Internet Monthly Report
are sent to the IETF-Announce list and to this IMR list.

Requests to be ADDED or DELETED from the Internet Monthly report list
should be sent to "majordomo@isi.edu" with the message body either
"subscribe imr" or "unsubscribe imr".

Details on obtaining the current IMR, or back issues, via FTP or EMAIL
may be obtained by sending an EMAIL message to "rfc-info@ISI.EDU" with
the message body "help: ways_to_get_imrs".  For example:

        To: rfc-info@ISI.EDU
        Subject: getting imrs

MERIT INTERNET ENGINEERING
--------------------------

     This report summarizes April 1998 activities of Merit's Internet
     Engineering group.

     A major focus of work for organizations participating in the
     Internet Routing Registry has been the transition to the next-
     generation Routing Policy Specification Language (RPSL), which will
     replace RIPE-181 (RFC 1786) as the language used to express routing
     policy in the IRR.  Databases in the IRR include the RIPE, MCI,
     ANS, and Bell Canada databases, as well as Merit's Routing Arbiter
     Database (RADB).

     The information in the Internet Routing Registry is stored in a
     number of RIPE database objects.  Peering policies are described in
     aut-num objects; routing announcements in route objects, and a
     group of AS's can be defined in an as-macro object. The syntax used
     in these objects is referred to as RIPE-181.  The RPSL language,
     which is also expressed in a set of RIPE database objects, makes it
     possible to express routing policy much more precisely than in
     RIPE-181.  The new language is being developed by the IETF Routing
     Policy System Working Group, which is chaired by Cengiz
     Alaettinoglu of the USC Information Sciences Institute.

     Merit has now entered a new phase of the transition from RIPE-181
     to RPSL.  The production RADB database continues to use RIPE-181-
     style database objects, but is now mirrored in a second database
     containing objects that have been converted to RPSL.  Merit staff
     and other IRR developers can now query the RPSL database, view
     selected objects, and modify local tools to parse RPSL syntax
     rather than RIPE-181.  The RIPE NCC has also entered this phase of
     the transition, and is running code that supports RPSL.

Internet Monthly Report                                       April 1998


     Merit's RPSL queries are being handled by a new multi-threaded
     database server, known as IRRd.  IRRd is also being used to
     generate production router configurations for the Route Server Next
     Generation (RSng) project's Route Servers.  The new code has
     provided an enormous performance improvement over RAWhoisd, the
     server previously used to generate the configs.  Route Server
     performance measurements indicate that IRRd generates router
     configurations up to 50 times faster than RAWhoisd.

     We encourage you to learn more about the IRR and the upcoming
     transition to Routing Policy Specification Language.  For pointers
     to the working group's RFC and Internet-Drafts, see:

             http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/rps-charter.html

     If you are interested in viewing your own RIPE-181 database objects
     converted to RPSL format, see ISI's RPSL Transition Web page:

             http://www.isi.edu/ra/rps/transition/

     This easy-to-use interface makes it possible to query a mirrored
     copy of the IRR that has been converted to RPSL, convert RIPE-181
     objects to RPSL, and perform RPSL syntax checking on the converted
     objects.

     The RSng project now provides additional route diversity for Route
     Server peers at MAE-WEST, the Silicon Valley exchange point
     operated by WorldCom.  One Route Server is now housed at WorldCom's
     San Jose facility; the other RS remains at NASA Ames Research
     Center.  Both systems had previously been housed at NASA Ames.
     MAE-WEST's two sites are linked together with multiple 155M bps
     circuits.  For information about peering with the Route Server Next
     Generation project's Route Servers, see:

     * New RFCs added to queue throughout the month

     Processed documents include those that are "Do Not Publish" as well
     as published RFCs.  This month RFC(s) were published that had
     previously been "Do Not Publish".  For this reason the "Beginning
     of Month" numbers, for RFCs that have been in the queue for 30, 60



Ramos                                                          [Page 17]

     and 90 days, may not be the same numbers as the "End of Month"
     numbers from last month.  Documents added back to the queue
     include:

             90 Days:                  draft-rfced-info-koi8-u-03.txt

     The Requests for Comments (RFCs) are a series of notes, started in
     1969, about the Internet (originally the ARPANET). The notes
     discuss many aspects of computing and computer communication
     focusing in networking protocols, procedures, programs, and
     concepts, but also including meeting notes, opinion, and sometimes
     humor. The specification documents of the Internet protocol suite,
     as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and its
     steering group (the IESG), are published as RFCs.

     RFCs-to-be are edited by the RFC Editor.  RFCs enter the RFC
     Editor's work queue either by an action of the IESG or by
     independent submission.  Most independent submissions are referred
     to the IESG to check for overlap with IETF work.  The IESG might
     put a hold on a document to gather more input from its members.
     The wait for an RFC to be published varies as there can be
     unforeseen complications (typically editorial matters that need
     clarification from the author).  Documents can be removed from the
     publication queue if they are found to be insufficient or incorrect
     or if the IESG asks the author to join work already in progress in
     the IETF.
