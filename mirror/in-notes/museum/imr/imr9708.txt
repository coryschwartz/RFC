INTERNET MONTHLY REPORTS
------------------------

The purpose of these reports is to communicate to the Internet Research
Group the accomplishments, milestones reached, or problems discovered by
the participating organizations.

Each organization is expected to submit a 1/2 page report on the first
business day of the month describing the previous month's activities.
These reports should be submitted via network mail to "IMR-ED@ISI.EDU".

The Internet Monthly Report mailing list is now managed by MajorDomo at
ISI.EDU.  The announcements of new issues on the Internet Monthly Report
are sent to the IETF-Announce list and to this IMR list.

Requests to be ADDED or DELETED from the Internet Monthly report list
should be sent to "majordomo@isi.edu" with the message body either
"subscribe imr" or "unsubscribe imr".

Details on obtaining the current IMR, or back issues, via FTP or EMAIL
may be obtained by sending an EMAIL message to "rfc-info@ISI.EDU" with
the message body "help: ways_to_get_imrs".  For example:

        To: rfc-info@ISI.EDU

                 Internet Monthly Report for August, 1997


  1. The next meeting of the IETF will be held in Washington, DC from
     December 8-12, 1997. Our local host is Newbridge Networks.

     The IETF will meet in Los Angeles from March 30 - April, 3, 1998
     and then in Chicago August 24-28. We're still looking into the
     final meeting of 1998.

     Once all arrangements have been made, notifications will be sent
     to the IETF Announcement list. Remember that information on
     future meetng sites can always be found in the file
     0mtg-sites.txt, located on the IETF shadow directories. Of
     course, this information is provided on the Web. The IETF's URL
     is:

                          http://www.ietf.org/


  2. The minutes of the IESG teleconferences be found on all the IETF
     shadow directories in the iesg directory.

     The following IESG minutes have been added:

     INTERNIC DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES

        The 39th IETF was held in Munich, Germany on August 11-15.  The
        IETF typically broadcasts 2 working group meetings in each time
        slot over the MBONE to allow remote participation in the
        meeting.  InterNIC Directory and Database Services has been
        recording the broadcast sessions and making them available on
        our servers to allow people who were unable to listen "live" to
        hear what went on.

        The MBONE recordings for the 39th IETF are now available on our
        servers in both RTP and Real Audio (TM) format.  The recordings
        are available through the web at:

                      http://www.internic.net/mbone/39th/

        Recordings from the 35th, 37th, and 38th IETFs are also
        available on the web at:

THE US DOMAIN REGISTRY
----------------------

The US Domain registration form is now available online at
http://www.isi.edu/us-domain.

The US Domain has the maps of all the delegated special domains online
at http://www.isi.edu/us-domain.

Some of the processing of the requests to the third level domain name is
now automated. In particular, most requests to register names in
localities already delegated are automatically forwarded to the
administrator of that locality.

Recent announcements:

1. A total of about 2000 locality domains that were delegated to several
domain name managers have been returned to the US Domain administrator.
These localities will be made available for redelegation in the coming
months.

2. For delegations made after 1-Jul-97, it is assumed by the US Domain
Administrator that every applicant for the delegation (or redelegation)
of a locality name has the written agreement of the legitimate
government for that locality for the applicant to manage the domain name
of that locality.

Evidience of such an agreement does not need to be presented at the time
of delegation (except that the administrative contact on the application
template must be the government representative).  However, if the
delegation is later challenged or contested, the manager of the locality
domain must produce the agreement.  Failure to do so will most likely
result in the transfer of the management of the locality domain to
another manager that does have such an agreement.

If there is a dispute as to what is the legitimate government for a
locality is and who may act for it, the league of cities or association
of municipalities that each state (as recognized by the National League
of Cities) may be asked to assist in resolving such disputes.



Ramos                                                          [Page 14]

Internet Monthly Report                                      August 1997


In some places there are overlapping jurisdictions with the same name
(for example, the city of Los Angeles and the county of Los Angeles).
In such cases, the higher level government should have priority.  A new
policy has been added regarding the charges for the domain name passed
on during delegation.  The administrator of the locality has to notify
one year in advance before charging for those domains.

3. The US Domain administrator no longer makes direct registrations of
hosts, and only makes delegations of third or fourth level domain names
(such as localities).

MERIT INTERNET ENGINEERING
--------------------------

     This report summarizes August 1997 activities of Merit's Internet
     Engineering group on behalf of the Routing Arbiter (RA) service and
     other projects.

     Organizations peering with Route Servers at the exchange points can
     now use a fast, automated procedure to update their Route Server



Ramos                                                          [Page 16]

     peering policy.  Authorized maintainers, i.e., end users authorized
     to update their organization's policy in the Routing Arbiter
     Database (RADB), can now use e-mail to:

       1. Retrieve their organization's inet-rtr (Internet router)
          objects, which store information about routes exported and
          imported by the Route Servers on their behalf.

       2. Edit the objects to reflect any new policy.

       3. Re-submit the updated objects through e-mail.

     The updates will be immediately reflected in the Routing Arbiter
     Database, which is used to generate the Route Server configuration
     files.  Previously, customer requests for policy updates had to be
     completed manually by Merit's Route Server Next Generation (RSng)
     staff.  The Route Servers were developed under the NSF-supported
     Routing Arbiter project, a partnership between Merit and the USC
     Information Sciences Institute.  RSng, a commercial follow-on
     activity, makes it possible for exchange point operators to
     purchase Route Server services from Merit.  For more information,
     see:

                             http://www.rsng.net

     The RSng inet-rtr object extends the definition found in the RIPE
     document, "Specifying an `Internet Router' in the Routing Registry"
     (RIPE-122).  The extended inet-rtr objects contain not only
     information about each customer's Route Server peering policy, but
     also private information such as contact procedures and NOC phone
     numbers.  To restrict access to the private information, inet-rtr
     objects had been stored in a database that could only be accessed
     by the Merit Internet Engineering staff and the NOC.  Now,
     authorized maintainers can retrieve both the public and private
     information through authenticated e-mail, with privacy still
     maintained.

     To retrieve an inet-rtr object, send a message to auto-dbm@ra.net
     with the following text:

                       request: <key-attribute>: <key>

     For example:

                       request: inet-rtr: 192.41.177.3






Ramos                                                          [Page 17]

Internet Monthly Report                                      August 1997


     You may request several inet-rtr objects in a single message, in
     addition to any other objects for which you are an authorized
     maintainer.  Simply insert a blank line between each request:

                        request:  inet-rtr:  1.2.3.4

                        request:  mntner:  MAINT-TEST

                         request:  aut-num:  AS10000

     Requests for Route objects must also include the route's origin AS:

                     request: route: 1.2.3.0/24  AS10000

     Note that you must follow the authentication method specified in
     your Maintainer object in order for the request to be processed
     correctly.  If your Maintainer object mandates the use of PGP, for
     example, you must use PGP to sign your requests.

     The new "auto-responder" can only be used to view your own database
     objects.  If you want to check another AS's registered policy, for
     example when debugging a network problem, see the RSng
     Configuration Viewer:

               http://www.rsng.net/peer_template/viewconf.html

     To use the Configuration Viewer to display public information in an
     AS's inet-rtr object, simply enter the IP address or AS number of
     the peer you want to obtain information about.  AS objects, Route
     objects, and Maintainer objects can also be retrieved through whois
     queries to the various databases in the Internet Routing Registry.

     The new RSng procedures were implemented by Gerald Winters, Jake
     Khuon, and Abha Ahuja of Merit, with assistance from Tom Spindler
     of the University of Michigan Information Technology Division.  If
     you have questions or comments about your configuration requests,
     send e-mail to rsng@merit.net.

     Kitty Bridges joined the Merit staff as Associate Director for
     National Networking.  Before coming to Merit, Bridges headed the
     University of Michigan's Future Computing Environment Project.  In
     this role, she led U-M's effort to move from a mainframe-based to a
     distributed computing environment.  Among the projects Bridges now
     oversees is Merit's role in Internet2.

     Merit staff members Sue Hares, Bill Norton, and Jake Khuon attended
     the 39th IETF in Munich during the week of August 17.  Hares, who
     has been proposed as Chair of the Internet Research Task Force's
     Routing Research Group, chaired an Inter-Domain Routing Working
     Group session.  The IDR Working Group is co-chaired by Yakov
     Rekhter.  Hares also made a presentation about multicast routing in
     GateD at the MBONE Deployment Working Group.

* New RFCs added to queue throughout the month

The Requests for Comments (RFCs) are a series of notes, started in 1969,
about the Internet (originally the ARPANET). The notes discuss many
aspects of computing and computer communication focusing in networking
protocols, procedures, programs, and concepts, but also including
meeting notes, opinion, and sometimes humor. The specification documents
of the Internet protocol suite, as defined by the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF) and its steering group (the IESG), are published as
RFCs.

RFCs-to-be are edited by the RFC Editor.  RFCs enter the RFC Editor's
work queue either by an action of the IESG or by independent submission.
Most independent submissions are referred to the IESG to check for
overlap with IETF work.  The IESG might put a hold on a document to
gather more input from its members.  The wait for an RFC to be published
varies as there can be unforeseen complications (typically editorial
matters that need clarification from the author).  Documents can be
removed from the publication queue if they are found to be insufficient
or incorrect or if the IESG asks the author to join work already in
progress in the IETF.
