     1. The next IETF is scheduled for November 16-20, 1992
        in Washington, DC. Our local host is U.S. Sprint. The
        Registration Reception will be held on Sunday, November
        15th, beginning at 6 PM.

        There will be some changes in the agenda for the
        Washington DC IETF meeting. First off, the agenda for
        Monday morning will be for presentations made by Working
        Groups on technical proposals for Internet Routing and
        Addressing. Another change is that there will be no Area
        reports on Friday morning. Instead, this time slot will be
        available for individual Working Group meetings.

     In August, IDPR was accepted by the IAB as an IETF Proposed Standard.
     We are anxious to gain some operational experience with the IDPR
     protocols in the Internet, through our planned pilot installation.
     During the past month, we have been devoting most of our time to
     designing a multicast mechanism for IDPR.

CICNET
-------

     CICNet report for July and August, 1992

     On July 1, CICNet made the official cutover to its new NOC services
     vendor, ANS.  The transition had been in the planning for several
     months and ANS began passive monitoring in mid- June.  Special
     recognition goes to AT&T and Ohio State University Academic Computing
     Services, our former NOC operators, for their high quality service and
     assistance in making this transition a smooth one.  As part of the
     restructuring of NOC services CICNet added Tom Easterday to the CICNet
     staff to handle network engineering responsibilities.  Ed Vielmetti of
     MSEN also joined the CICNet staff under a long term consulting
     agreement to provide support for WAIS, Gopher, and other information
     services.  July marked the initiation of an SMDS trial with Ameritech.
     Cisco Systems and Kentrox are also providing support for this trial.
     Initial SMDS sites include the University of Chicago, the University
     of Illinois at Chicago, and Argonne National Laboratory.  During July
     CICNet staff attended a special FARNET meeting to review the draft
     NSFNET backbone solicitation, the IETF meeting, the annual meeting of
     the American Library Association, and a meeting sponsored by FARNET
     and the OERI Regional Educational Laboratories.

     In August, CICNet was contracted by GTE North, Inc. to GreatLinks,
     which will provide dial up connectivity, system administration, and
     information services for the Pioneering Partners Program, an activity
     jointly sponsored by GTE North and the Council of Great Lakes
     Governors.  GreatLinks will be operational in mid-September.
     Pioneering Partners provides training and support for K-12 educators
     and business and community leaders in the eight state Great Lakes
     region.  On August 12-13 CICNet sponsored the Gopher '92 Workshop, a
     meeting which brought together Gopher Information Service experts from
     almost all CICNet member sites and numerous academic and networking

     organizations around the country.  The CICNet Guide to Resources,
     which contains detailed descriptions of contents and access methods
     for numerous information resources around CICNet and the Internet was
     published in August.  It is available in a plain text version for
     anonymous ftp from nic.cic.net in the directory pub/resourceguide.
     Information on accessing the Guide via Gopher and WAIS are also
     available in this directory. Both the Guide and the Gopher '92
     Workshop proceeding are available in hardcopy from CICNet. In late
     August, CICNet staff participated in a meeting sponsored by the
     Coalition for Networked Information on NREN legislation, the pending
     NSFNET backbone solicitation, and access to government documents.

LOS NETTOS
----------

     PacBell did a poor job of the flash cut for the JPL move.  JPL was
     down for 22 hours instead of 45 minutes.  Our pre-testing of the
     new local loop didn't reveal the data pattern sensitivity problem
     with the T1 once we were cut over.  PacBells comprehensive 2 hour
     end-to-end testing didn't either.

     During the JPL move it was revealed that JPL is a second large
     organization that is duplicating the Los Nettos remote console
     access system which permits access to console ports for CSU/DSU's
     and routers, and the ability to power cycle the network equipment.
     Both JPL and TRW are installing many copies of the Los Nettos
     remote console access system in their own networks.

MERIT/MICHNET
-------------

     Merit Network, Inc., has been awarded $475 thousand by the NSF to
     help fund a series of planned enhancements to MichNet. Proceeds of
     the two-year grant will be used for new high-speed Cisco routers
     and data circuits.

     Data transfer capacity on seven MichNet links is now being upgraded
     from speeds of 56 Kbps to T1. The network upgrade will provide
     multiple T1 connections between backbone nodes in Ann Arbor,
     Detroit, East Lansing, Flint, Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo, Rochester,
     and Saginaw.  The NSF grant will also help fund a new 56Kbps link
     between Mt. Pleasant and Saginaw providing users in central
     Michigan with a second link to the network backbone as backup. In
     addition, a new 56Kbps link to Houghton will be put into service,
     and Houghton's current link to Ann Arbor will be doubled in
     capacity from 56Kbps to 112Kbps

     MichNet's SMDS trial with Ameritech and Michigan Bell is well
     underway. The test links MichNet sites at the University of
     Michigan in Flint, Wayne State University, Oakland University, and
     the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.  During the test period,
     the use of SMDS will provide a T1 link to MichNet's Flint node. The
     Oakland node, previously two hops away from the Internet gateway in
     Ann Arbor, will be only one hop away.

Internet Monthly Report                                      August 1992


     The trial will last approximately six months.

     MichNet and its affiliates have made many upgrades and changes to
     its over the summer. Some of those changes include:

     The Benton Harbor/St. Joseph MichNet node has been moved from Lake
     Michigan Community College to St. Joseph High School. New 1200-9600
     bits per second modems have been installed at the site.

     At the end of July, Western Michigan University installed 9600 bits
     per second MichNet dialup modems at the Muskegon Regional Center.

     Western Michigan University also recently upgraded the MichNet
     modems to 9600 bits per second at the following sites: Kalamazoo,
     Battle Creek, and Grand Rapids. The new modems will support 1200,
     2400, and 9600 bits per second service.

     As a part of these improvements, and to help provide a standardized
     modem configuration across MichNet, 300 bps service was eliminated
     at a number of sites.

     The 56K link between Flint and Saginaw was upgraded to 1.5Mbps (T1)
     in mid-June. This provides T1 to CIESIN and Saginaw Valley State
     University.

     This summer, the University of Michigan upgraded the 19.2 Kbps
     dial-in service in Ann Arbor to include v.42 capability. Six more
     lines were added to the service. In addition, twelve more lines
     were added to the 9600 bps dial-in service.

     Merit Network, Inc. has signed an agreement with ANS which will
     allow its business users throughout Michigan to pass commercial
     data traffic over ANS's nationwide high-speed computer network
     backbone.  Access to the national high-performance computer network
     infrastructure will be provided through MichNet, Merit's statewide
     data network.

     During the last year, Merit has been engaged in outreach activities
     to the Michigan K-12 community. The primary focus has been to
     spread the word about the Internet. These outreach activities have
     resulted in Project Connect, which brings together a team of
     organizations to connect the first Michigan schools to the
     Internet. Merit is pleased to announce Novell's participation in
     this project. Novell has provided over $150,000 worth of Novell
     software products.  MichNet will also be relying on the resources
     of its members and affiliates as the project proceeds.

     connected to MichNet. When the showcase network is complete, the
     participating schools will be: Mumford High School, Detroit, MI;
     Lamphere Schools, Madison Heights, MI; Northville Schools,
     Northville, MI; Model High School, Bloomfield Hills, MI; and

NSFNET/ANSNET BACKBONE ENGINEERING
----------------------------------

     T3 Backbone Status
     ==================

     The system software and routing software for the T3 routers has
     stabilized. The new RS/960 FDDI card has completed testing and
     deployment schedules are in progress.  A new system software build
     with support for 10,000 routes maintained locally on the smart-card
     interfaces is being tested on the T3 Research Network.

     Planning is now underway for dismantling of the T1 backbone which
     is targeted for November. Several steps to be completed prior to
     dismantling the T1 backbone include support for OSI CLNP transport
     over the T3 backbone, and the deployment of the redundant backup
     circuit plan for the T3 ENSS gateways at each regional network.

     Further activities in support of the Phase IV upgrade to the T3
     backbone are in progress.

     Backbone Traffic and Routing Statistics
     =======================================

     The total inbound packet count for the T1 network during August was
     3,903,906,145, down 17.9% from July.  298,961,253 of these packets
     entered from the T3 network.

     The total inbound packet count for the T3 network was
     13,051,979,670, up 1.3% from July.  129,835,094 of these packets
     entered from the T1 network.

     The combined total inbound packet count for the T1 and T3 networks
     (less cross network traffic) was 16,527,089,468 down 3.1% from
     July.  Reports on T3 backbone byte counts for June, July and August
     were incorrect due to SNMP reporting problems. These will be
     corrected soon in reports available on the nis.nsf.net machine. The
     totals for June, July, and August are 2.279, 2.546, and 2.548
     trillion, respectively.

     As of August 31, the number of networks configured in the NSFNET
     Policy Routing Database was 6360 for the T1 backbone, and 5594 for
     the T3 backbone. Of these, 1233 networks were never announced to
     the T1 backbone and 1102 were never announced to the T3 backbone.
     For the T1, the maximum number of networks announced to the
     backbone during the month (from samples collected every 15 minutes)
     was 4866; on the T3 the maximum number of announced networks was
     4206.  Average announced networks on 8/31 were 4817 to T1, and 4161

     to T3.

     New FDDI Interface Adapter for ENSS Nodes
     =========================================

     We have a new RS960 FDDI adapter for the RS/6000 router that
     provides much improved reliability and performance.  It was our
     hope that the new RS960 FDDI interface adapter targeted to upgrade
     the older be ready for deployment in early August.  However several
     serious bugs were encountered during testing in late July, and the
     upgrade has been delayed by more than a month.

     Fortunately we have corrected or worked around all of these known
     remaining bugs.  We are re-running our full suite of regression
     tests, and a full set of stress tests on the T3 test network during
     the labor day weekend.  Pending the successful completion of our
     tests, we expect that the first set of FDDI adapter upgrades on the
     production T3 ENSS nodes could begining during the week of 9/7.  We
     would like to begin planning for the installation of these new
     interface adapters at ENSS128 (Palo Alto), ENSS135 (San Diego),
     ENSS129 (Champaign), and ENSS132 (Pittsburgh).  We will develop
     plans for any further FDDI deployments after these first 4
     installations have been successfully completed.

     Dismantling the T1 Backbone
     ===========================

     The current target for dismantling the T1 backbone is November '92.
     This can be accomplished once the remaining networks using the T1
     backbone have been cut over to the T3 backbone (these are: ESnet,
     EASInet, Mexican Networks at Boulder, and CA*net); an OSI CLNP
     transport capability over the T3 backbone is in place; the T3 ENSS
     nodes are backed up by additional T1 circuits terminating at
     alternate backbone POPs; and the network-to-network
     source/destination pair statistics matrix is available on the T3
     backbone. These activities are described below.  Since the RCP
     nodes on the T1 backbone are experiencing further congestion and
     performance problems due to the growth in networks, we are planning
     to reduce the number of networks announced to the T1 nodes by the
     T3 interconnect gateways. This will eliminate the use of the T3 to
     back up the T1 for those networks yet to cut over, in the event of
     a failure in the T1 network.

     Remaining Network Cutovers
     --------------------------

     The ESnet cutover is waiting for a new version of software to be
     configured for the ESnet router peers at FIX-West and FIX-East.

Internet Monthly Report                                      August 1992


     The Mexican autonomous system will be cut over soon, pending
     communication with the folks in Mexico.  We are developing a plan
     that will allow EASInet to peer directly with the T3 network.  The
     plan for CA*net is to remove the RT from the token ring on the NSS
     nodes at Seattle, Princeton and Ithaca, configure them to run the
     CA*net kernel and gated, and peer directly across the ethernet to
     the T3 ENSS at these sites.

     OSI Support Plan
     ----------------

     In order to dismantle the T1 backbone, we need to support the
     transport of OSI (CLNP) packets across the T3 network. Because we
     would like to target dismantling of the T1 backbone for sometime in
     late 1992 and the T3 backbone software for support of OSI is still
     in test, we would like to proceed with a phased (multi-step)
     migration for support of OSI switching over the T3 network in order
     to ensure network stability as we introduce OSI software support.
     The migration plan involves several steps:

     1. Convert RT/PC EPSP routers that reside on the shared ENSS LAN
        into OSI packet encapsulators.  This would be done at the 8 or
        so sites where there are regionals that currently support OSI
        switching services.  OSI traffic is encapsulated in an IP packet
        on the RT router and forwarded as an IP packet across the T3
        network to a destination RT de-encapsulator.  This software
        already exists and can support the migration of OSI traffic
        off of the T1 backbone, with no software changes required to
        the T3 backbone.  This software is entering test now and could
        be running in production by early October.

     2. Introduce new RS/6000 OSI encapsulator systems that are the
        running AIX 3.2 operating system with native CLNP support.
        These machines will replace the RT OSI encapsulators on the
        shared ENSS LAN.  As the CLNP software gets more stable,
        the RS/6000 system can begin to support non-encapsulated dynamic
        OSI routing. There are still no changes required to the production
        T3 network software in this step.  This step could occur sometime
        in the mid-fall.

     3. Deploy the AIX 3.2 operating system and native CLNP switching
        software on the T3 routers across the backbone.  The experience
        gained in step#2 above will facilitate this migration.  This
        step is expected sometime in January 1993.

     T1 ENSS Backup Circuits
     -----------------------

     The T1 backbone is currently providing backup connectivity in the
     event of a problem with the T3 backbone. Since the T3 ENSS nodes
     are currently singly-connected to a CNSS at an MCI POP, the single
     T3 circuit and CNSS node represent a single point of failure.  As a
     backup plan, each T3 ENSS will be connected to a new T1 circuit
     which terminates at a different backbone POP CNSS.  This will allow
     bypass recovery in the event of circuit or CNSS failure.  We are
     executing a test plan on the test network to measure internal
     routing convergence times and end-user observations during a backup
     transition.  These circuits are being ordered now and are expected
     to be in place by late October.

     Network Source/Destination Statistics
     -------------------------------------

     During the migration to the smart card forwarding technology
     (RS960/T960) we temporarily lost the ability to collect network
     source/destination pair traffic statistics.  This is because
     packets were no longer passing through the RS/6000 system processor
     where the statistics collection application software ran.  We are
     now testing new software for near-term deployment that will allow
     us to continue to collect statistics for each network
     source/destination pair.  These statistics include packets_in,
     packets_out, bytes_in, and bytes_out.  The statistics will be
     cached on the RS960 and T960 interfaces and uploaded to the RS/6000
     system for processing and transmission to a central collection
     machine.

     Increase Routing Table Sizes on T3 Network
     ==========================================

     We continue to experience an increase in ANSNET/NSFNET advertised
     networks, (see Backbone Traffic and Routing Statistics, above) The
     current on-card routing table size on the T3 router RS960 card
     (T3/FDDI) and T960 card (T1/ethernet) supports 6,000 destination
     networks with up to 4 alternate routes per destination.  The
     current on-card routing tables are managing on the order of 12K
     routes (including alternate routes to the same destination).

     We are now testing new software for the RS960 and T960 interfaces
     that will be deployed shortly that supports up to 10,000
     destination networks with up to 4 alternate routes per destination.
     This software will be deployed on the T3 network in the near
     future.

Internet Monthly Report                                      August 1992


     We also continue to work on support for on-card route caching which
     will significantly increase the upper limit on the number of routes
     to unique destination networks that may be supported.  This
     software will be available with the AIX 3.2 operating system
     release of the router software in early 1Q93.

     Phase-IV T3 Network Upgrade Status
     ==================================

     The scheduled upgrades to the T3 backbone discussed in the July
     report are continuing on schedule and will allow the dismantling of
     the T1 backbone.  The major features of this plan include:

     1)   T3 ENSS FDDI interface upgrades to new RS/960 card.  This
          is currently being scheduled at 4 regional sites.

     2)   T3 ENSS backup connections are being installed.  A T1 circuit
          will be installed at each T3 ENSS to allow a backup connection
          to a different CNSS. This will provide some redundancy in the
          case of T3 circuit or primary CNSS failure.  These circuits
          are scheduled for cutin in October.

     3)   T3 DSU PROM upgrades.  A problem was uncovered in testing
          the new DSU firmware.  The new firmware supports additional
          SNMP function and fixes a few non-critical bugs.  Since this
          problem was uncovered, a fix has been provided. However the
          testnet has been occupied with FDDI and other system testing
          since then.  Therefore the upgrades to the DSUs that were
          scheduled to begin on 9/14 will be postponed until early
          October.

     4)   The existing set of CNSS routers in the Washington D.C. area
          will be moved to an MCI POP in downtown Washington D.C. on
          9/12 for closer proximity to several ENSS locations.  The
          tail circuits of the existing network attachments to this
          POP will be reduced to local access circuits only.

     5)   The installation of a new CNSS in Atlanta is scheduled for
          9/26 to reduce the GA Tech T3 tail to local access only, and
          provide expansion capability in the southeast.

     T3 Network Performance Enhancements
     ===================================

     The general approach to engineering the T3 network has been to
     prioritze enhancements that improve stability rather than
     performance. Since the T3 network RS960 upgrade in May '92, the
     stability of the network has become very good, and we have been



Cooper                                                         [Page 21]

Internet Monthly Report                                      August 1992


     able to spend more resources focusing on the performance of the
     network, which has also improved significantly.  With the upcoming
     deployment of the new RS960 FDDI adapter, we expect to observe
     higher peak bandwidth utilization across the T3 network, and higher
     aggregate packet traffic rates.  In anticipation of this, we have
     conducted some baseline performance measurements on the T3 network
     that serve as a basis for continued tuning and improvement over
     time.

     T3 Network Delay
     ----------------

     In order to analyze the delay across the T3 ANSNET, we start by
     measuring the delay incurred by each T3 router hop, and then
     measure the circuit propagation delay across all backbone circuits.
     We have MCI T3 circuit route mileage figures which can be
     calibrated with PING measurements to determine how much each hop
     through a T3 router adds to the round trip time.

     A set of round trip delay measurements was made using a special
     version of PING that records timestamps using the AIX system clock
     with microsecond precision.  The technical details of the
     measurements may be described in a future report on the subject.
     The end result is that the round trip transit delay across a T3
     router was measured to be about 0.33 ms (0.165ms one way delay),
     with a maximum variance between all samples on the same router of
     0.03 ms.  The T3 routers currently experience very little variance
     in delay at the current load on the T3 network.  The T3 router
     transit hop delay is therefore negligible compared to the T3
     circuit mileage propagation delay.

     It turns out that the round trip delay between the Washington POP
     and the San Franciso POP can be 77ms for packets traversing the
     southern route (Washington->Greensboro->Houston->Los Angeles->San
     Francisco) or 67ms for packets traversing the northern route
     (Washington- >New York->Cleveland->Chicago->San Francisco).

     During the timeframe of "Hawthorne" technology routers, it was
     appropriate to choose internal routing metrics that balanced load
     across redundant T3 paths, and minimized transit traffic on the
     routers.  However now with RS960 technology, the requirement for
     load-balancing, minimizing transit traffic and hop count, and
     maintaining equal cost paths is no longer justified.  With the
     introduction of the new Atlanta CNSS, we will explore adjustment of
     the internal T3 link metrics to minmize round-trip latency ENSS<-
     >ENSS.  This will improve overall network performance as perceived
     by end users.  The summary on T3 network latency is:




Cooper                                                         [Page 22]

Internet Monthly Report                                      August 1992


     (1)  Delays due to multiple hops in the T3 network are measurable,
          but not large enough to matter a whole lot.  The observed
          T3 ANSNET one way delay associated with a single T3 router
          hop is 0.165mS per router (1.35mS cross country one way
          delay due to 8 router hops). This is negligable compared with
          the cross-country propogation delays (e.g. 35ms one way). It
          would require the addition of 30 T3 routers to a path to add
          10 ms to the unloaded round trip time, given constant circuit
          mileage.  Delays introduced by extra router hops are negligible
          compared to circuit mileage delays.

     (2)  For small packets, like the default for ping and traceroute,
          the round trip delay is mostly dependent on circuit mileage,
          and is relatively independent of bandwidth (for T1 and beyond,
          at least).

     (3)  All T3 links within the network are maintained at equal
          cost link metrics regardless of physical mileage.  This
          was designed during the timeframe when RS/6000 routers were
          switching packets through the system processor, and hop
          count, and transit traffic through the router were important
          quantities to minimize.  With the introduction of pure adapter
          level switching (e.g. no RS/6000 system processor involved
          involved in switching user datagrams), minimizing hop count
          and router transit traffic become less important.  Minimizing
          overall ENSS<->ENSS delay becomes more important.

     (4)  The T3 ANSNET maintains two different physical circuit routes
          between Washington D.C.  and Palo Alto.   Each of these routes
          represent equal cost paths, and therefore will split the traffic
          load between them.  However one of these physical routes is
          about 600 miles longer than the other.  This can introduce
          problems involving asymmetric routes internal to the T3 network,
          and sub-optimal latency.  The T3 ANSNET circuits are physically
          diverse to avoid large scale network failures in the event of a
          fiber cut.  Compromising physical route diversity is not planned.
          However some reduction of real T3 circuit mileage (and therefore
          about 5mS of delay) might be possible on the ANSNET with the
          installation of the Atlanta POP CNSS in September.  ANS is
          conducting a review with MCI to determine whether the
          Washington->Greensboro->Houston->Los Angeles->Hayward physical
          route can be reduced in total circuit miles without compromising
          route network diversity.  This might be possible as part of
          the plan to co-locate equipment within Atlanta.

     T3 Network Throughput
     ---------------------

     The RS960 adapter technology will support up to five T3 interfaces
     per router, with an individual T3 interface operating at switching
     rates in excess of 10K packets per second in each direction.  The
     unit and system tests performed prior to the April '92 network
     upgrade required the CNSS routers to operate at 50KPPS+ aggregate
     switching rates, and 22Mbps+ in each direction with an average
     packet size of 270 bytes on a particular RS960 interface.  The
     router has also been configured and tested in the lab to saturate a
     full 45Mbps T3 link.

     The performance that is currently observed by individual end users
     on the T3 network is largely determined by their access to the
     network.  Access may be via an ethernet or an FDDI local area
     network.  Many users have reported peak throughput observations up
     to 10Mbps across the T3 network using ethernet access.  Several of
     the T3 network attachments support an FDDI local area network
     interface which, unfortunately, does not result in more than 14Mbps
     peak throughput across the T3 backbone right now.  With the new
     RS960 FDDI adapter to be introduced in September, end-to-end
     network throughput may exceed 22Mbps in each direction (limited by
     the T3 adapter).  The initial RS960 FDDI card software will support
     a 4000 byte MTU that will be increased later on with subsequent
     performance tuning.  Further performance enhancements will be
     administered to the T3 backbone in the fall and winter to further
     approach peak 45Mbps switching rates for end-user applications.

        As mentioned last month, the ANR group at SDSC has completed two
        papers in network analysis, which are currently available for
        anonymous ftp from serendip.sdsc.edu in the /pub/Papers
        directory.  The first paper is on traffic characteristics of the
        T1 NSFNET backbone; the second is a study of measurement
        considerations for assessing unidirectional latencies.

        We are continuing to explore traffic sampling techniques in a
        wide area environment, in pursuit of a reasonable scheme for
        practical real-time use in the Internet.

        As part of an effort related to end-end reliabilities we held a
        two day workshop with IBM, with IBM people from Milford,
        Hawthorne and Austin attending. This discussion also included
        aspects of multimedia packet video applications. The second day
