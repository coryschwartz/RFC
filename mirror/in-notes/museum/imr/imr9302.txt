     PRIVACY AND SECURITY
     --------------------

        The PSRG met in San Diego on February 8-10.  PSRG members
        continued work on an Internet Security Architecture document.
        An initial, very rough draft of the document was reviewed in
        detail and many revisions were proposed.  A format was adopted
        for additional sections of the document, and members volunteered
        to write several of these sections.  Rob Shirey, who is acting
        as editor of the document, will be making revisions and
        accepting additional inputs in preparation for producing the
        next draft of the document.

        Following the PSRG meeting, on 2/11-12, the first PSRG Workshop
        on Network and Distributed System Security took place in San
        Diego.  This workshop, co-sponsored by Lawerence Livermore
        National Laboratory and the Internet Society, was organized by
        Dan Nessett (LLNL).  Dan and the rest of the PSRG members acted
        as the program committee for this workshop, selecting 12 papers
        from over 20 submissions.  Over 160 attendees spent two days in
        this single-track, eight-session workshop.  Proceedings were
        provided to attendees and an second printing of the proceedings
        is being undertaken to satisfy additional demand.  Plans are
        underway to make this an annual event, under Internet Society
        sponsorship.  Dan Nessett will serve as chair for next years
        event, with Rob Shirey (Mitre) and Russ Housley (Xerox) as
        program committee chairs.

        The next PSRG meeting is tentatively scheduled for July 7-9, in
        Cambridge (UK), immediately preceding the IETF meeting in
        Amsterdam.

INTERNET ENGINEERING REPORTS
----------------------------

     1. Let me remind everyone that the next IETF meeting will be held
        in Columbus, Ohio from March 29th through April 2, 1993 (yes,
        this does mean that the IESG Open Plenary will be held on April
        First), and is being co-hosted by OARNet and The Ohio State
        University. The Newcomers' Orientation and the Registration
        Reception will be held on Sunday, March 28. Registration
        information has already been sent and updates will be made to
        the IETF Announcement list.

        Note that the 27th meeting of the IETF, scheduled for July of
        1993, will be held in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and will be
        co-hosted by SURFnet and RARE. This will be the first time an
        IETF meeting has been held outside of North America. The
        Secretariat will be distributing information and instructions
        for making hotel reservations relatively soon to facilitate
        making travel plans and arrangements, but are NOT accepting
        meeting registrations for Amsterdam at this time.

     2. The IESG adopted the following policy on the scheduling of BOFs
        during IETF Plenary meetings. This policy goes into effect
        following the Columbus, Ohio meeting in March, 1993.

        1. All BOFs wishing to meet during an IETF Plenary must have the
           approval of the appropriate Area Director. The Secretariat
           will NOT schedule or allocate time slots without the explicit
           approval of the Area Director.

        2. The purpose of a BOF is to conduct a single, brief discussion
           or to ascertain interest and establish goals for a working
           group. All BOF organizers are required to submit a brief
           written report of what transpired during the BOF meeting
           together with a roster of attendees to the IETF Secretariat
           for inclusion in the proceedings.

        3. A BOF can only be held once (ONE slot at one IETF Plenary
           meeting).

        4. Under unusual circumstances an Area Director can, at his/her
           discretion, allow a BOF to meet for a second time. Typically,



Cooper                                                          [Page 4]

Internet Monthly Report                                    February 1993


           though not a requirement, this is to develop a charter to be
           submitted to the IESG.

        5. BOFs are not permitted to meet three times.

        6. Non-IETF groups wishing to participate in IETF meetings may
           hold a BOF, for single-event discussion, or may pursue
           creation of normal IETF working groups, for on-going
           interactions and disussions. The rules governing such BOFs
           are the same as for all other IETF BOFs and working groups.

        7. When necessary, IETF WGs will be given priority for meeting
           space over IETF BOFs.

     3. The IESG approved or recommended the following nine actions
        during the month of February, 1993:

        o  Network Time Protocol <rfc1305> be published as a Draft
           Standard.
        o  SMTP Service Extensions <draft-rose-extensions> be published
           as a Proposed Standard.
        o  SMTP Service Extension for Message Size Declaration
           <draft-moore-extension-size> be published as a Proposed
           Standard.
        o  Transition of Internet Mail from Just-Send-8 to
           8Bit-SMTP/MIME <draft-ietf-smtpext-transition> be published
           as an Informational RFC.
        o  SMTP Service Extension for 8bit-MIMEtransport
           <draft-ietf-smtpext-8bit-mime> be published as a Proposed
           Standard.
        o  Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
           <draft-ietf-osids-lightdirect> be published as a Proposed
           Standard.
        o  The String Representation of Standard Attribute Syntaxes
           <draft-ietf-osids-syntaxes> be published as a Proposed
           Standard.
        o  Directed ARP <draft-ietf-iplpdn-directed_arp> be published
           as an Experimental Protocol.
        o  DUA Metrics <draft-ietf-osids-dua-metrics> be published as
           an Informational RFC.

ANSNET BACKBONE ENGINEERING
---------------------------

     Network Status Summary
     ======================

     The deployment of the AIX 3.2 operating system on the T3 routers is
     tentatively scheduled to begin during the first week in April '93,
     pending the successful completion of system test in March.  The
     upgrade will involve a hard disk swap over 4 weekend maintenance
     windows to be scheduled in April.

     The ANSnet forwarding table now supports over 7K destinations that
     are actively announced.  New adapter microcode and routing protocol
     changes are being implemented to increase the current capacity of
     the on-card forwarding tables beyond 10K destination networks.

     Minor routing software enhancements to the rcp_routed software were
     made in February to support the migration to AIX 3.2, as well as
     more efficient logging support, and fixes for third party routing
     exchanges.

     T1 backbone dismantling activities continued in February, and will
     be completed in March.

     T3 network performance tests were conducted in February in
     cooperation with Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center.  Preliminary
     results have correlated peak performance observations that are
     close to the maxiumum theoretical adapter bandwidth.

     Backbone Traffic and Routing Statistics
     =======================================

     The total inbound packet count for the network (measured using SNMP
     interface counters) was 26,404,260,412 on T3 ENSS interfaces, up
     8.5% from January.  The total packet count into the network
     (including all ENSS serial interfaces was 30,358,722,577.

     As of February 28, the number of networks configured in the Merit
     Policy Routing Database was 9582 for the T3 backbone. Of these,
     1955 were never announced to the T3 backbone (e.g. silent nets).
     Merit is working with the regionals to reduce the number of
     "silent" nets in the policy routing database.  The maximum number
     of networks announced to the T3 backbone during the month (from
     samples collected every 15 minutes) was 7013.  Average announced

     networks on 2/28 were 6978.

     The overall average number of networks announced via the primary
     configured AS path was around 95% in February.

     AIX 3.2 Migration Plan Status
     =============================

     The T3 backbone software upgrade to support the AIX 3.2 operating
     system is tentatively scheduled to be begin on April 3rd, pending
     the completion of system testing in March.

     The upgrade will be administered by swapping out CNSS/ENSS disk
     drives loaded with AIX 3.1 with new AIX 3.2 disk drives at each
     site.  The process involves several steps including AIX 3.2 Hard
     Drive Creation, Hard Drive Installation, and Phased Deployment.
     Most of the upgrade tasks have been automated via shell scripts to
     assure uniform processes across systems.

     Replicas of each CNSS/ENSS file system will be created in the lab
     on the AIX 3.2 platform.  This replica will be shipped with a
     backup tape for use during "fall back" procedures, in the unlikely
     event of a drive failure on site.  Other tools such as AIX 3.2 boot
     diskettes will be shipped to support this new platform in the
     field.

     The hard drives on routers at all sites will be backed up prior to
     the hard drive installation.  This AIX 3.1 platform backup could be
     used during "fall back" procedures.  All configuration files that
     might have changed since the replica drive was made will be
     preserved on a neighboring CNSS/ENSS for comparison after the
     system is brought up with AIX 3.2.

     AIX 3.2 Phased Deployment
     -------------------------

     The Deployment will occur in four (4) phases.  Each of these phases
     will occur on consecutive weekends starting on Friday April 2nd
     around 23:00 local time and continuing into Saturday morning.  Each
     phase will include upgrades to selected CNSS nodes and their
     adjacent ENSS nodes during the same maintenance window.  The CNSS
     upgrades will be staggered in pairs to allow optimal use of T1
     backup circuits at T3 ENSS's as well as to maintain continuous
     monitoring capabilities by either the ANS Ann Arbor primary NOC, or
     the New York backup NOC.  The tentative schedule (pending
     completion of system testing in March) is as follows:





Cooper                                                         [Page 10]

Internet Monthly Report                                    February 1993


     Phase I    (April 2)  - Washington D.C.
     Phase II   (April 16) - Seattle/Denver, San Francisco/Los Angeles
     Phase II   (April 23) - Greensboro/Atlanta, Houston/St. Louis
     Phase IV   (April 30) - Hartford/New York City, Cleveland/Chicago

     The staggering of upgrades between the CNSS and its adjacent ENSS
     will reduce the ENSS outage approximately the elapsed time of their
     site upgrade. The upgrade process to a router is as follows:

     (1)     Upgrade T3-B CNSS router, bring up routing

     (2)     Upgrade the T3-C and associated T3 ENSS's simultaneously,
             bring up routing

     (3)     Upgrade T1-C and associated T1 ENSS's, bring up routing.

             This process will be followed for the first CNSS pair then
             the second CNSS pair.

     Installation Fall Back Procedures
     ---------------------------------

     In the unlikely event that a disk failure occurs (in shipping or
     installation), the following fall back procedures will be followed:

     1.      Install site from AIX 3.2 BACKUP for that machine (shipped
             with hard drive).

     2.      Install site from AIX 3.2 BACKUP of another machine on site.
             (applies to CNSS ONLY, disk is shipped with hard drive)

     3.      Re-install AIX 3.1 hard drive

     4.      Install site from AIX 3.1 BACKUP for that machine (created
             before 3.2 install started).

     AIX 3.2 Testing
     ---------------

     The AIX 3.2 testing proceeded during February, and scheduled to
     complete by mid-March.  Most of the problems that have been fixed
     during the latter part of the system test cycle relate to the
     interaction between the routing daemon and the 3.2 kernel routing
     tables.  One of the more significant changes in the 3.2 kernel is
     the support a radix trie forwarding table.

     Growth in Destination Networks
     ==============================

     The following table (provided by Enke Chen at Merit) illustrates
     the growth in the ANSnet router forwarding tables (maximal number
     of announced networks of each month):

     MONTH           MAX             RATE(%)
     =====           ====            ======
     07/92           4596
     08/92           4866            5.9
     09/92           5070            4.2
     10/92           5432            7.1
     11/92           5772            6.3
     12/92           6239            8.1
     01/93           6654            6.7

           (Avg monthly growth rate: 6.4%)

     The interface forwarding tables on the ANSnet routers are currently
     configured to support 10K destinations.  In the near term,
     microcode changes will be deployed to support improved address
     compression in the forwarding tables which will support 12K
     destinations.  Following the AIX 3.2 deployment, ANS will deploy
     GATED software.  The GATED routing daemon will support a number of
     enhancements that increase the forwarding table capacity.

     BGP4 within GATED will support CIDR aggregation.  The kernel,
     microcode and routing daemon support for CIDR is expected to reduce
     the rate of growth in the number of on-card routes.  ANSnet will
     configure to receive and redistribute aggregated routes to other
     networks that support BGP4.  ANSnet will also perform proxy
     aggregation for networks that are not running BGP4.  No capability
     is planned to explode/de-aggregate supernet routes to allow re-
     advertising them to non-BGP4 neighbors.

     Routing Software Changes
     ========================

     Changes to the rcp_routed software on the T3 network included
     improving the logging performance on ENSS206 (Geneva) since there
     are over 200 routes announced by 3rd party peers.  Other changes
     support the planned migration from AIX 3.1 to AIX 3.2 software,
     support for handling multiple peer routers with multiple interfaces
     to the ENSS (typically one FDDI and one ethernet per peer), and
     additional changes to address problems associated with changing
     third party route announcements.

     Routing Stability Measured on the T3 Network
     ============================================

     During February, internal routing stability was measured by short
     term disconnect times (disconnects of five minutes duration or
     less).  Overall the network saw almost 99% complete routing
     stability (no internal disconnects in any part of the network).
     All individual nodes reported 99.8% stability or better. ENSS206
     (Geneva) continued to experience circuit problems and reported 1
     hour and 20 minutes of short term BGP disconnect time over the
     course of the month.  Taking into account the configuration runs,
     ENSS206 had only 25 minutes of instability.  All other nodes
     reported less than 51 minutes or about 98.9% stability.  Only 10
     nodes reported less than 99.9% stability.  The configuration runs
     accounted for the majority of the instability.  Only ENSS201 (a new
     installation) experienced higher instability at 48 minutes (outside
     the configuration window).  Only 5 nodes reported more than 15
     minutes of instability outside the configuration window during the
     entire month.

     The external routing stability report covers data gathered during
     the following interval:

     Feb  1 00:11:12 UTC - Feb 28 19:05:14 UTC

     During the reporting period 241,195 IBGP updates were received from
     536 distinct AS paths. These updates contained 591,707 network
     numbers (or an average of 2.5 networks per update or 1,103.9
     updates per AS path). There were 2,448 distinct network number. The
     most unstable network during this period was contained in 5,263
     unreachables.

     The total number of updates and number of AS paths were up slightly
     from the January data.  There were fewer updates per AS path. We
     have been forwarding reports to selected peer networks to help
     identify and eliminate chronic route flaps.  The automation of
     these reports is in progress so that the data can be sent daily for
     any AS which supports  networks that were unstable in the previous
     day.

     RS960 FDDI Deployment Status
     ============================

     During February we installed new FDDI adapters on ENSS141



Cooper                                                         [Page 13]

     (Boulder), and ENSS142 (WestNet).

     It has come to our attention that some peer network routers may be
     taking a performance hit by setting the MTU to 4000 bytes to match
     the T3 backbone MTU.  On the T3 backbone, packets received larger
     than 4000 bytes are fragmented on the FDDI card (with the first
     fragment being 4000 bytes).  This will be changed when AIX 3.2 is
     deployed.  The MTU will then increase to 4352 bytes on both the T3
     and FDDI cards.  We will still be able to *receive* packets larger
     than 4352 bytes in size, and fragment them (with first fragment
     being 4352 bytes).  However we will not *send* packets of size
     larger than 4352 bytes.  We therefore suggest that peer networks
     using FDDI set their router MTUs to default maximum.

     CNSS97 Maintenance
     ==================

     During January and early February we experienced problems with the
     CNSS97 (Denver) router which results in the reset of several T3
     interfaces.  This affected ENSS141 (Salt Lake City), and ENSS142
     (Boulder) nodes.  On 2/13, the router system board and one of the
     T3 interfaces were swapped out.  During the change, ENSS141/ENSS142
     were rehomed to CNSS96.  They were rehomed back to CNSS97 following
     the upgrade.  No further problems have been experienced on CNSS97
     since then.

     T1 Dismantling Near Completion
     ==============================

     During February we dismantled and removed most of the T1 backbone
     RT equipment.  Some of this equipment was donated to regional
     network locations and will remain onsite.  There are still 5 sites
     for which the remainder of this equipment will be packed and
     shipped in March.

     OSI Configuration Activities
     ============================

     EON (OSI Encapsulator) systems will be installed to support OSI
     traffic destined for the T3 backbone at ENSS136 (College Park) to
     support MAE-East, and within OARnet to support the March IETF
     meeting.

     International Circuit Maintenance
     =================================

     Special maintenance was conducted to support problem identification
     and resolution on international circuits to ENSS173 (Mexico), and

     ENSS206 (Geneva).

     ANSnet Performance Testing
     ==========================

     A set of performance tests were conducted on the T3 backbone on
     2/19 in cooperation with Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center (Matt
     Mathis).  The tests involved use of a PSC developed tool "uping",
     which can be viewed as windowed version of traceroute.  It measures
     data rate and loss as functions of ttl (distance into a pipe), mtu,
     and window size.

     All tests were done with MTU=4000 bytes (The current backbone MTU).
     There was no observed packet loss from the PSC Cray C90 to ENSS132
     (Pittsbugh) at any rate tested.  The measured bandwidth to CNSS41
     (Cleveland) was 20.8 Mb/S (650 pps).  The measured bandwidth to
     CNSS40 (also Cleveland), and all points further west to the San
     Diego Supercomputer Center was 17.6 Mb/S (550 pps).  This seem to
     be due to two factors.  The first is the ambient load on the T3
     network.  The second is that the RS960 HSSI interface cards that
     connect to T3 DSUs are clocked by the DSU (22.5Mbps), however the
     HSSI interface cards that are connected to other HSSI interfaces in
     the POP are clocked using on-card clocking and are therefore
     limited to 20Mbps.  This will be changed on a new revision to the
     RS960 card later in 1993.

     PSC provided the uping program to ANS along with the data he
     collected during the 2/19 PSC-SDSC test.  ANS ran some tests on the
     T3 testnet using the "uping" program.  There was no other traffic
     on testnet during these measurements.  ANS observed up to 19.648
     Mbps from the ANS Elmsford T3 ENSS to two testnet CNSS nodes.  This
     confirms that the clock rate on intra-POP links is 20Mbps.

     In the coming months, ANS will attempt to correlate the other
     background traffic with the uping traffic, and identify any sources
     of congestion using on card RS960 instrumentation.

BOLT BERANEK AND NEWMAN INC.
----------------------------

     Defense Simulation Internet (DSI)

     The following is a synopsis of the various DSI activities that
     occurred during February.

     During this period, we finished alpha testing of the ST2 router
     software.  New video teleconferencing software was also
     successfully tested.

     Packet aggregation software was deployed on the secure side of the
     network to increase the effective throughput of the Network
     Encryption System (NES).  BBN is continuing development of the NES
     security software using an ST Encapsulated Processor (STEP).

     Efforts have also begun on a major demonstration that will occur in
     the May time frame.  It will be conducted for the May AUSA
     conference to be held in Orlando, Florida.  Advancements in
     simulation technology will be demonstrated over a wide area
     network.

     To date, more than 55 sites have been installed in CONUS, Hawaii,
     Europe, and Korea, with the most recent being installed in sites
     located on the East Coast of the United States.  In addition,
     several more sites are in the process of being added to the
     network.  Lastly, all five sites in Europe have been installed,
     with some awaiting final approval to operate in a secure mode.

     Real-time Multicast Communications and Applications

     On February 9th, we demonstrated the use of the Video Information
     Server (VIS) over a wide area network at DARPA.  The set of
     machines that comprises the VIS was located at BBN and a client
     machine running video applications was set up at DARPA for the
     demo.  The machines were located on local Ethernets (at each site)
     and these were in turn connected to the DARTNET which supported the
     wide area communications.

     The video server machines are Sun workstations.  These machines
     control a variety of video devices including video disc players and
     analog video switches.  One of the server machines contains a
     Parallax board which is used to convert analog video to digital
     video for transmission over the wide area net. The video server
     also contains a WAIS database of video information, obtained by
     recording and decoding closed captioned video and indexing the
     closed captioned text to the video.  Users search the WAIS database



Cooper                                                         [Page 16]

Internet Monthly Report                                    February 1993


     to select video of interest.

     The client machine used in the demo was a Sun workstation with a
     Parallax board which is used to receive and decode digital video
     and display the video in a window on the workstation.  All of the
     video control, i.e. searching the video database for the desired
     video clip, locating an appropriate video device to play the clip,
     and controlling the video device (i.e. forward, pause, play, etc.),
     was done remotely over the wide area network.  There were no local
     video devices.  The video was delivered digitally over the wide
     area network.

     This demo showed several new features of the Video Information
     Server.  The original VIS was designed to work in a local area.
     Not only was video delivered via analog lines, but many of the
     control mechanisms relied on features only available in a local
     area network, for example, local file sharing as a method for
     obtaining information about video clips.  The demo showed not only
     the digital delivery of video, but also the use of new mechanisms
     for video searching and control of video devices, which enable
     these functions to be done on a wide area network.  We have now
     demonstrated the use of the Video Information Server in a wide area
     network, and will continue to work on this system to improve
     reliability and add new features.

     In parallel with the VIS efforts, we have completed implementation
     of "anycasting" service and a version of "multi-level flows".

     o Anycasting is a concept that allows an application to address a
       replicated object and find the nearest/best one.  This feature
       can make it possible to place relatively static information about
       servers and services in regional service directories distributed
       throughout the Internet, while allowing the choice of a
       particular server (of an indefinite and dynamically changing
       group of servers) to be made by the network according to network
       and client conditions.

     o Multi-level data flows are a special case of resource
       coordination in which a group of information flows forms a whole:
       for example, different levels of video resolution.  Network
       support for multi-level data flows can be used to permit a
       recipient to specify what part of the total data flow should be
       conveyed, when the data has been separated into, say, high,
       medium, and low resolution components.  This is useful in
       extending applications such as video conferencing into
       environments where some of the sites may be connected by low
       speed links.  The source sends at full rate to the multicast
       address, but only the low resolution data would be delivered to

       the disadvantaged sites.

     Over the next couple of months, we will be experimenting with and
     enhancing these services and integrating them with the Video
     Information Server.

     Scaleability

     During the past month, there have been two major activities on the
     scaleability project.

     The network simulator component has been updated to use InterViews
     version 3.1, rather than 2.6, so that future work on the network
     topology editor can make use of the Unidraw graphical editor
     toolkit.  Work was also started on adding delay modeling to the
     network simulator.

     The other major scaleability activity has been to define and
     characterize a set of potential scaling techniques for
     investigation under the algorithm study portion of the project.
     Approximately a dozen potential techniques have been identified,
     and an experimental plan and analysis procedure has been defined
     for each.  These algorithm studies will be submitted to the project
     sponsors for selection of the set which will actually be explored
     as part of the current effort.

     Inter-Domain Policy Routing

     During February, we continued to make progress in preparing for the
     Internet pilot demonstration of IDPR.  We have spent most of our
     time getting one SPARCstation to function as three separate policy
     gateways in three separate administrative domains.  The task may
     sound simple, but it involves a certain amount of "art", given the
     fact that we do not have a Sun source license.  We have a little
     more testing to do before we will be ready to place the software in
     the Internet.

     MULTIMEDIA CONFERENCING

     This month we extended the teleconferencing facilities at DARPA and
     ISI by interconnecting the wide-area packet teleconferencing
     systems, which use DARTnet and DSInet, with the ZAPT local-area
     desktop conferencing system.  The ZAPT system, installed both at
     DARPA and ISI, uses analog audio and video with NeXT workstations
     running a custom extension of Bellcore's Touring Machine software,
     and provides a local analog distribution and teleconferencing
     capability.

     MMCC, the multimedia conference control program, allows users to
     select among different codecs for the different wide-area systems,
     and among dedicated conference rooms or the interconnect to the
     desktop system.  To avoid conflicts created by multiple
     conferencing systems needing access to shared hardware (e.g., MMCC
     and ZAPT controlling the crossbar switch, echo canceller, video
     codecs), we integrated resource registration into our device
     servers.  Now, a client application can use the server to reserve
     access to the hardware and prevent another teleconferencing
     application from stealing it.  The resource reservation is also
     fault tolerant, so that owner failure releases the device.

     Routines for software decoding of the video data stream produced by
     a Bolter/Concept codec have been integrated into the popular "nv"
     video tool with much help from Ron Frederick at Xerox PARC. A number
     of improvements were made in the decoding as well, including
     interpolation of the data in low-resolution mode.  We are working on
     arrangements to allow release of the decode routines in binary form.

     The paper, "Case Study: Multimedia Conference Control in a Packet-
     switched Teleconferencing System", was completed this month, and
     will appear in the Journal of Internetworking.

JANET
------

     The bandwidth of the connection between JANET and the NSFNET (ie
     over the UK/US Fat-pipe) was recently increased from 512 kbit/s to
     1 Mbit/s.  This is currently being shared between JANET and NASA.
     (NASA uses part of the bandwidth to support US/UK scientific
     collaborations.) The link will be reengineered during March to
     separate the NASA and JANET traffic, with JANET traffic having a
     dedicated 1 Mbit/s link.

     The increase in bandwidth on the Fat-pipe has meant an increase in
     load on the router that connects JANET to its international
     connections (gw.ulcc.ja.net). This is now saturated. The main
     reason for this is that most of the IP traffic passing through the
     router is being carried over X.25 (the main transport mechanism for
     IP across JANET.) Handling this is processor intensive within the
     routers used (Cisco AGS+/4); in practice they saturate at
     approximately 2500 pkt/s.  To provide a further increase in
     performance, an inner backbone of "native" IP (ie direct over HDLC)
     is being created. When this is in place the routing will be changed
     so that much of the traffic to and from gw.ulcc.ja.net travels over
     the HDLC backbone.  This is expected to reduce the processing load
     on the router, and allow better throughput between JANET and its
     international links.

     Planning is now well advanced for the creation of the initial phase
     of the SuperJANET data network. This will be a 34 Mbit/s IP network
     linking 7 sites in the UK. The implementation of this network is
     expected to take place at the end of March and beginning of April.

     The total IP traffic switched across JANET in February was
     approximately 950 Gigabyte. Of this approximately 160 Gigabyte
     passed through the UK/US Fat-pipe, and approximately 80 Gigabyte to
     and from EBONE.  The number of hosts attached continues to rise.
     This is measured, to first order, by the size of the ac.uk domain.
     As of end February it contained 50828 distinct hosts in 289
     subdomains.  (This represents approximately 90% of the uk domain.)

MERIT/MICHNET
-------------

     This month Merit's report is separate from ANS's Backbone
     Engineering report, which appears elsewhere in the IMR. This makes
     sense because of the separation of activities of the two groups.
     Merit's Internet Engineering group has been focusing on routing
     coordination, database and protocol development, and service
     aspects for NSFNET; ANS handles operation and engineering of the
     backbone itself.

     The Merit IE group consists of the following staff members:

             Enke Chen
             Elise Gerich
             Sue Hares
             Laurent Joncheray
             Ken Latta
             Gartha Parrish
             Sheri Repucci
             John Scudder
             Steve Widmayer
             Jessica Yu

Internet Monthly Report                                    February 1993


     Additionally Merit's Network Management Systems group handles
     database and net management software development and consists of:

             Andy Adams
             Dale Johnson
             Chinh Nguyen
             Bill Norton
             Steve Richardson
             Rick Riolo

     Following is a summary of activities and projects pursued during
     February:

     1. NSFNET Connection to MAE-East

     An agreement was made which allows the NSFNET service to peer with
     network service provider peers at the Metropolitan Area Ethernet -
     East (MAE-East), an experimental Network Access Point in the
     Washington DC area. Currently the AlterNet and PSI networks, and
     the Global Internet Exchange (GIX) route server are peering with
     the NSFNET service over this network.

     The GIX route server is operated by the RIPE group in Europe, and
     will distribute routing announcements for European networks to
     peers at MAE-East. Merit is collaborating with RIPE, and is working
     on installing an additional experimental route server for handling
     non-European routes.

     2. New Policy Routing Database System

     Testing of a new Policy Routing Data Base system based on the
     Informix package is nearly complete. The system formerly ran on an
     IBM mainframe using the Spires database system. The new system
     duplicates all of the features of the current system and is able to
     handle all of the configuration file and report generation
     requirements without postprocessing. The system is being phased in
     by first verifying the configuration file integrity and then
     performing a suite of tests of the data entry front end. The target
     date for operational use of the new system is March 15.

     3. Silent Nets

     Merit has started a project to analyze the NSFNET Policy Routing
     Database (PRDB) to look for networks that are not being announced
     to the backbone.  Enke Chen of Merit has been sending each regional
     or midlevel (AS administrator actually) a list of the "silent nets"
     for their autonomous system.  Our goal is to prune out of the
     database any networks not being used and not expected to be used in



Cooper                                                         [Page 25]

Internet Monthly Report                                    February 1993


     the near future.  This is important for a couple of reasons: 1) we
     are approaching a hard limit in the table size in the ANS backbone
     routers; and 2) storing information for the non-announced networks
     requires human resources and some router space resources since all
     of the configured nets are stored in the configuration file on each
     router.

     As of March 5, there are 10057 networks configured in the database.
     The number of silent nets for February was 1955, ie. 1955 networks
     which were in the database as of February 1 were never announced in
     the entire month.  So far we have received requests to delete about
     200 of the silent nets.  The maximum number of nets that were
     announced to the backbone as of 2/28 was 7037. Historical growth in
     network announcements is summarized in the following table.

     Merit is working with the regional and midlevel network operators
     to develop methods of expediting the elimination of the silent nets
     in order to prevent potential operational problems due to routing
     table size.

     4. Inter-Domain Routing Protocol Development

     Sue Hares and John Scudder are working on development of the IDRP
     protocol in gated and have made significant progress in the last
     month. A testbed consisting of RS/6000s (AIX) and 486 systems
     (running BSD 4.4) is running gated and using the ISO IS-IS
     protocol.  IDRP is now being tested on this testbed. Merit expects
     to be able to provide this code to ANS for deployment on the
     backbone later this year.

     5. Shared Whois Project

     Sheri Repucci has been working with the RIPE and Network Solutions
     groups to share the data in the Merit Policy Routing Database with
     the NIC Whois and RIPE NCC. The three organizations have agreed on
     a common transfer syntax for sharing the data, and Sheri has
     developed a program which will merge the data and produce reports
     on conflicts, duplication and missing information. The goal is to
     allow the data to be synchronized to improve the quality of contact
     and registration information for networks. The intent is to use
     X.500 to make the information more accessible and allow backup
     copies across organizations.

     6. IETF Connectivity

     Merit and ANS have been working with the OARnet staff to ensure
     that good connectivity will be provided to the IETF in Columbus
     later this month. ANS will be adding a second T1 circuit for OARnet



Cooper                                                         [Page 26]

Internet Monthly Report                                    February 1993


     to the backbone, which will be used mainly for the mbone
     audio/video multicast transmission. Merit has re-engineered its
     Michigan mbone tunnel connections to improve connectivity for
     MichNet as well as for OARnet. ANS will provide an EON RT system
     for encapsulation of OSI CLNP datagrams, in order to allow
     demonstrations of TUBA software.

     7. CA*Net Transition

     As reported in earlier IMR reports, the Canadian backbone, CA*Net,
     has been transitioning to a new configuration for its connection to
     the NSFNET service. Initially the connection in three locations
     (Princeton, Ithaca and Seattle) was via the T1 backbone NSS nodes.
     In the first phase of the transition, the NSS's were still used but
     only for the purpose of transit between the CA*Net link and the
     ethernet to get to the T3 ENSS. This month the CA*Net software has
     been successfully deployed on the USA-side RT routers which will
     allow a single RT node to replace the NSS to connect CA*Net to the
     T3 backbone, in each of the three locations.

     8. CIDR and BGP-4 Configuration

     The target date for deployment of CIDR and BGP-4 capability on the
     NSFNET backbone service is June, 1993. This will be done in phases,
     first with gated replacing the current rcp_routed daemon
     (supporting BGP-3) and later adding BGP-4. After a test phase
     involving regional and midlevel networks, aggregation will be
     enabled which will lead to the goal of limiting routing table
     growth. Merit is working on making design changes to the database
     as well as specifying new service options for configuration of
     route aggregation. The backbone service will need to 1) accept
     aggregates from regional or midlevel peers, 2) announce aggregates
     to peers, and 3) perform aggregation on behalf of peers for inbound
     announcements under certain conditions. We will submit an Internet
     Draft detailing these configuration parameters and service options
     for discussion at the upcoming IETF.

NEARNET (NEW ENGLAND ACADEMIC AND RESEARCH NETWORK)
---------------------------------------------------


     Membership Update

     As of February 26, 1993, NEARnet has grown to a total of 194 member
     organizations.

     NEARnet delivers usage statistics to members

     NEARnet now sends weekly line utilization graphs either as email
     messages containing Postscript graphs or as faxes.  This service
     has been well received by members who can now use this information
     to assess their bandwidth requirements.

     Internet Gopher System Presentation to NEARnet members

     Over 150 nearnet members attended the Internet Gopher System
     Presentation on Thursday, February 18 from 2:00 to 4:00 at the Bolt
     Beranek and Newman Inc. (BBN) Newman Auditorium in Cambridge,
     Massachusetts.

     Farhad Xerxes Anklesaria, a designer and member of the Internet
     Gopher Team was the NEARnet guest speaker for this presentation.
     Farhad gave an helpful introduction and interesting overview of the
     Internet Gopher System.  His introduction included a description of

NORTHWESTNET
------------

     In February 1993, two new organizations joined the NorthWestNet
     community, which now numbers over 90 members.  The two new members
     are the Washington State Department of Information Services
     (Olympia, WA) and Advanced Hardware Architecture (Moscow, ID).

     In a teleconference meeting 2/25/93, the User Service Committee
     began planning for the October 1993 NorthWestNet Annual Meeting and
     discussed the implementation of two working groups that will focus
     on a new User Services Representative kit and electronic
     information distribution for the NorthWestNet community.

     On 2/26/93, the NorthWestNet Engineering Advisory Board met.  Among
     other issues, their agenda covered redundancy options,

SDSC (SAN DIEGO SUPERCOMPUTER CENTER)
-------------------------------------

     SDSC Network Activities
     =======================

     The physical plant installation of fiber continues.  FDDI to
     selected offices is complete.  Fiber is also being used to extend
     V.35 to the various rooms in which VTC services are being offered.
     The next step is the conversion of the Sequoia 2000 Dec systems
     from Ethernet over ThinWire to FDDI and Ethernet over fiber.  The
     later will allow each system to be on both the Center's own LAN and
     directly connected to the Sequoia Project's private network.  These
     steps are awaiting a microcode update to the DS5000's.

     CSUnet (the network for the Calif State University System) will be
     installing their own cisco router on the Center's DMZ Ethernet
     during March.  This will replace their use of a prort on an SDSC
     router.

     SDSC will be hosting the first Torrey Mesa MAN planning meeting
     during March.  This will see if there is enough interest to build
     such a MAN - one with a min. speed of 100meg.

     SDSC Applied Network Research Group
     ===================================

     The Applied Network Research Group at SDSC has recently completed
     its annual report, summarizing progress of its research efforts
     during the past year, including collaborative efforts with the
     University of California, San Diego.

     Research topics include:

             o analysis of the existing data and instrumentation of the
               NSFNET
             o sampling network traffic data in wide area environments
             o end-to-end delay and jitter across wide-area networks
             o routing stability and characteristics
             o reliability and quality of service metrics; performance
               evaluation of a multimedia application
             o and individual statistics of interest for performance
               evaluation and modeling of a wide area environment.

     We also include research efforts outside the scope of this proposal
     but within the scope of the larger ANR research agenda, such as our
     involvement with the CASA gigabit network infrastructure and our
     participation in NSF's NREN Engineering Group.

     Working with Thierry Turletti, INRIA, we now have full interworking
     h.261 software tested real against GPT and other H.261 hardware
     codecs. In particular, we can source video from a codec, filter off
     the H.221 fgraming, packetize and multicast over INRIAs protocol
     over IP multicast, and decompress and receive under X in pure
     software quite conveniently.

     WE are now trying to reconnect the UK to the MBone so we can run
     this multicast internationally (for the Internet and MICE).

     2 papers were submitted to conferences, on CBT Multicast and on a
     Control-theoretic analysis and design of a video transport
     protocol.

     A note on the (ironic) unsuitability of RPC for building
     distributed programs (in particular, conference control systems)
     was distributed, and will be submitted to a suitable place after

The Thirteenth RIPE Meeting

   The Thirteenth RIPE Meeting was held at in October 1992 in Paris,
   France, with 95 attendees.  Approval of the agenda was first, with
   parallel sessions starting after general plenaries.  Technical
   sessions slated for this meeting were postponed until the next
   meeting in Prague.

General Plenaries

   Daniel Karrenberg presented a second quarterly report on the RIPE
   NCC.  There was a summary of main topics.  The activities of the last
   quarter included the Internet Registry, the RIPE Database (DB),
   Domain Name System (DNS) Area, General, Goals/Evaluation, and future
   work.

   Internet Registry (IR)

      The IR identified and started up 36 local registries, and
      developed interim procedures.  It fielded 172+ requests during the
      last 2 months.  Greater than 50% of the requests were via the
      postal services or fax.  Two-thirds of the requests were completed
      in the same day.  89% completed in 5 days.  Class C allocation
      takes 1.96 days on average.  Class B allocation typically takes
      two days, but can take up to 24 days, depending upon the
      application.  The IR assigned 50 Class Bs and 940 Class Cs.  Kudos
      were given to the local registries for their work and cooperation.

   RIPE Database

      New updates are fully configurable.  They are in process of
      revising the indexing of software, and there is a new, improved
      WHOIS server.  There is a new RIPE WHOIS client, and a global
      exchange format developed.  The RIPE NCC has frequent exchanges
      with the DDN NIC and Merit.  Would like to work on Internet maps,
      but the RIPE Map working group has yet to meet.  Tools and
      guidance are needed from the Map working group.

   DNS Area

      The DNS Area provided a regular host count and consistency
      checking tools.  In regards to document store, the RIPE NCC
      reorganized all RIPE documents and improved information services.
      Guidance is needed from the RIPE DNS group.  Statistics are
      needed!

   General

      The RIPE NCC produced information leaflets, provided several
      presentations, provided RIPE support, and an IP providers mailing
      list.  It is in processing of setting up and testing audiocasts.
      The RIPE NCC has improved the document store, RIPE meeting
      support, and support structure of RIPE working groups.

   Goals/Evaluation

      The goals are following the NCC Activity Plan (RIPE 35).
      Priorities are not fixed!  The NOC needs guidance from RIPE (e.g.,
      working groups, individuals, etc.).  The goals are ambitious and
      guidance from some RIPE working groups are critical.  What is not
      in the activity plan is referrals (i.e., refer questions about
      Internet services to suitable providers).  It is hoped that the
      new National Science Foundation (NSF) "InterNICs" (the NIC of
      first and last resort) will be able to refer end users to
      appropriate NICs/NOCs.

   RIPE Database Statistics

      Most queries come from the .EDU domain, most of which are outside
      of Europe!!

The Future of the RIPE NCC

   It is an organizational position (neutral, impartial, and a friendly
   organization).  The RIPE community feels this is a good idea.  RARE
   feels this should be changed to an organizational unit.  The RIPE NCC
   must be trusted by all services providers.  This will not change.
   The RARE Council now understands this.  They provided a short and
   concise statement of how RARE sees the RIPE NCC.

   In summary, the RIPE NCC has had a good start, and has ambitious
   goals.  Guidance is needed from RIPE working groups.  It is still
   FUN!

Report from RARE Council of Administration (CoA)

   The RARE Technical Committee (RTC) defines the technical program of
   RARE, suggests and solicits new activities, defines an annual work
   plan (which is submitted to CoA), prioritizes Task Force (TF)
   proposals, and follows other forums (e.g., IETF, RIPE).  Decisions
   are based on consensus.  Funding of RARE WGs used to be paid by the
   European Commission (EC), but this is now ending.  Funding currently
   available is now 25% of what it was.  RTC members include Tom Kalin
   and Tim Dixon.

   Emphasis on IP Networking

      RARE WGs and TFs are not restricted to OSI.  There is a cultural
      revolution not yet reflected in the current workplan.  There is a
      strong desire by CoA to solve the problems that exist.  User
      services is important, both current work and what is expected.
      Recognizing the IETF work goes without saying.

      RARE WGs are long lived groups per area of interest.  Membership
      is open, a convenor is appointed by the RTC, forum of
      communication (experts and non-experts), two meetings per year
      (JENC, NSC).  Common meetings (RTC, WG-convenors).  All WGs have
      charters, a convenor, and a work plan well defined.

      RARE TFs are small, short lived groups (experts).  They address a
      specific activity, have clear goals and deliverables.  Can be
      funded or unfunded.  TFs disband after each action.

   Current RARE WGs

      1) WG-CHAR - multiple character sets
      2) WG-MMM  - multimedia (come up with recommendations)
      3) WG-ISUS - information services/user services
      4) WG-LLT  - covered by Layer 1 - Layer 4
      5) WG-MSG  - developing message services
      6) WG-NAP  - network application support (not yet available)
      7) WG-NOP  - operations
      8) WG-SEC  - security/PEM mail pilot

   RARE Technical Reports (RTRs) have enhanced visibility and
   credibility of work, and providing peer review and approval.

Traffic Measurements - Torben Nielsen

   connected all packets that had flowed through Hawaii (PACCOM
   topology) and brought up transit traffic to a known entity, while
   funding mechanisms.

   Goals

      Data Collection - allows for the determination of where the
      traffic is coming from and going to.  What services are being
      used, and for how long, what patterns of usage exist and the
      periodicity of those patterns.

   Traffic Collector Topology

      A lurker was multi-homed (without interfering with measurements).
      When data (50-70% full data) is transferred to the net, it is
      compressed and stored on one of two staging disks.  The disks are
      then dumped to Exabyte type when convenient.  This started on 2
      Dec 91, and ran more or less until 2 June 1992.

   Results

      40 Exabyte tapes and 13 optical disks were collected.  This is
      about 90 gigabytes of compressed packet headers (about 175
      gigabytes uncompressed).  The preliminary observations show 1.4
      billion packets/280 gigabytes of data, in over 100,000 IP hosts
      addresses/over 500 networks.

EBONE Strategy Discussion - Bernhard Stockman

   The current intent of the EBONE strategy is to act as a neutral
   interconnect point and provide Pan European IP services.  It is an
   open market by stimulating IP provides.  It provides a neutral
   platform with a strategy document to be produced, which will include
   a fair cost distribution, and US connectivity included.

Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) User Services Reports

                           18 September 1992

   When the IETF was first established, it did not immediately create a
   distinct User Services Area.  As of 1991, this area has grown to take
   its place with other Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) areas

   as the importance of a user services forum has increased globally.
   This area provides an international forum for people interested in
   all levels of user services, to identify and initiate projects
   designed to improve the quality of the information available to users
   of the Internet.

   One continuing goal of the User Services Area is to coordinate the
   development of user information services by clearly and concisely
   providing documentation information and distribution for the Internet
   community.  FYI (For Your Information) RFCs (Request for Comments)
   are introductory and overview documents for network users.  Their
   purpose is to make available general information, rather than the
   protocol specifications or standards that is typical of other RFCs.
   FYIs are allied to the RFC series of notes, but provides information
   about who does what on the Internet.  The FYI RFC series has proved a
   success since its initiation, and its goal is to continue to do so.
   A current list of FYI RFCs are listed at the end of this document.

   The actual projects of the User Services Area are handled by the
   creation of Working Groups.  There are currently eleven working
   groups in this area.

   activities that relate to the production, dissemination, and support
   of NIR tools.  NIR is a cooperative effort of the IETF, RARE, and
   CNI.

   Network Information Services Infrastructure (NISI).  NISI is
   exploring the requirements for common, shared Internet-wide network
   information services.  The goal is to develop an understanding for
   what is required to implement an information services
   "infrastructure" for the Internet.

   Universal Resource Identifiers (URI).  URI is chartered to define a
   set of standards for the encoding of system independent Resource
   Location and Identification information for the use of Internet
   information services.

   User Documentation (USERDOC2).  UserDoc2 is preparing a revised
   bibliography of on-line and hard copy documents/reference materials/
   training tools addressing general networking information and how to
   use the Internet.  (Target audience: those individuals who provide
   services to end users and end users themselves.)

   User Glossary (USERGLOSS).  User-Gloss is chartered to create an
   Internet glossary of networking terms and acronyms for the Internet
   community.

   User Services (USWG).  The User Services Working Group provides a
   regular forum for people interested in all user services to identify
   and initiate projects designed to improve the quality of information
   available to end-users of the Internet.

   Whois and Network Information Lookup Service (WNILS).  The purpose of
   WNILS is to expand and define the standard for WHOIS services, to
   resolve issues associated with the variations in access, and to
   promote a consistent and predictable service across the network.

   =======================================================================

                   "Integrated Information Architecture"

   Many new networked services to identify, access, and retrieve
   information resources have sprung up in the last several years --
   archie, WAIS, and Netfind, to name only three.  Now, much as the
   Internet has tied many disparate networks together into an integrated
   system, the pressing problem is how to integrate these many new
   services into a single coordinated Internet information naming,
   discovery, and retrieval system.

   There are three vital areas of this integration effort that the IESG
   is interested in pursuing:

           1) The identification, cataloging, and documentation of
              networked information services, new and old.

           2) The standardization of descriptions and identification
              schemes for networked resources, and the distribution and
              implementation of these identifiers.

           3) The integration and interoperability of the various
              new information services.

   To this end, the IESG is creating three new working groups:

      1) Networked Information Retrieval (NIR) -- NIR will work on the
         first issue above by identifying, cataloging, and documenting
         networked information services.  The result will be a published
         catalog of network information retrieval services.  In addition,
         NIR will liase with other organizations working on this goal,
         such as RARE ISUS and CNI.

Internet Monthly Report                                    February 1993


      2) Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) --  URI will concentrate
         on the second issue above, particularly on the standardization
         and implementation of identification schemes for networked
         resources.  There will be two primary components in this
         effort: a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) which is a string
         which tells how to locate a document.  The second part is a
         Universal Resource Serial Number, which is used to uniquely
         identify a resource, so that one can, for example tell if
         two documents with different file names are, in fact, the
         same.  The standard identification scheme developed by
         URI will be used by NIR to define the standard resource
         formats.

      3) Integration of Internet Information Resources (IIIR) --
         IIIR will work on the third issue by developing technical
         specifications and documentation for a) interoperation between
         the various information services and b) the integration of
         new information services into the existing CIM (combined
         information mesh).  After the specifications for interoperation
         have been completed, IIIR will examine the need for additional
         protocols necessary to further integrate the CIM, including
         gateway protocols, query routing protocols, and other
         mechanisms.

   In addition to the above named groups, the IETF wishes to facilitate
   the standardization of descriptions and data formats for various
   specific information services by chartering single-protocol working
   groups which will work on this standardization.  Examples of such
   groups are the Internet Anonymous FTP Archive group (IAFA), which is
   working on standardization of anonymous FTP archives, and the new
   Whois Network Information Lookup Service (WNILS), which is working on
   standardization of services using the WHOIS protocol.

   The IESG considers these WGs to be components of a single coordinated
   IETF effort to create an integrated Internet information
   architecture.  Therefore, the chairs and membership of each group
   will be active participants in the other groups.  The overall
   coordination of this effort will be under the joint management of the
   Applications and User Services Area.

   Due to the importance of an Integrated Internet Information Service
   Architecture, the IESG requests the working group chairs and the
   Applications and User Services area directors to jointly expand this
   brief overview into a more fully fleshed out architectural statement,
   and to issue periodic progress reports describing how the integrated
   information service is developing.

RIPE Parallel Meetings Attended

   IP Registry/Addressing BOF

      Rudiger Volk suggested that there should be a list of the local
      registries.  Daniel Karrenberg mentioned that the list is changing
      daily and that is not the way to operate.  There is also the
      semantics of different categories of commercial, research, and
      government.  Elise Gerich pointed out that we are waiting for the
      NSF NIS solicitation to be announced.

      80-90% of the requests that the IR receives are paper submissions,
      not via electronic mail.  Model of supernetting - US backbones and
      regionals.  Not the case in Europe and not an easy task due to the
      interconnection of things in Europe right now.

      The distributed scheme is local/homogenus, with all registries
      which will refer requests between different registries.  It is
      absolutely necessary and feasible to create local templates
      (primary in English, secondary in a native language).  There needs
      to be more documentation spelling out procedure and how the
      template could be uniform.

   Set of Documents to be Developed

      1) Create a common user document.  Bob Day volunteered
         to be the focal point for the user documents.

      2) Create a common template - Daniel Karrenberg volunteered for
         template development.  Joyce K. Reynolds took an action item to
         initiate a quick line to the new IR (InterNICs), once it has been
         announced and established.  She also volunteered the IANA to help
         out about how the template should be developed

      3) Exchange and document evaluation criteria.  This still needs to
         be determined.

   Nebulous addressing.  There are too many Class As and Class Bs.  What
   is the substantiation??  What about Class Cs??  There is also the
   consideration of the growth factor.  It is evolutionary and ready to
   take on the challenge.  Focus on topological, not geographics...then
   subdivide.  There are no firm guidelines on how Class Bs are
   assigned.  The IANA needs to provide a set of guidelines for each set
   of IP addresses.  Also, to clarify the rationale to maintain the
   Class Bs, as there are no instructions.  The guidelines should
   provide different scenarios so that one can judge how to assign a
   number.  There is a need to take the "class" out of "Class B"
   flavors.  There is a notion that a Class B is the "prestigious big

   thing" to obtain in the Internet.

   Registry system funding was not discussed, due to time constraints.
   Regarding the Rekhter I-D on network numbers, it is considered a good
   draft.  There are some reservations about Class B's being retained by
   the IR.  It is considered okay for now, but this topic will be
   reevaluated later.

RIPE Database WG

   Included in the agenda was the proposed structure of the DB,
   organizational and legal issues, operational issues, and technical
   issues.  There was approval of the RIPE-DB leaflet for publication.

      1) Ownership/copyright of database use.  Review of RIPE-02 paper.
         The X.400/X.500/MHS issues liaison with the RTC.  No formal
         result.  This is a very complicated issue that needs consulting via
         a lawyer.  There should also be interaction with OSI.

      2) Operational.  There is a need for a change to the database
         format.  The DDN NIC has changed its format, with additional
         information available.  What about the non-standard use of fields??
         Contact the US representatives first.

      3) "Major Part" of Technical issues.  Modification of the "in"
         field for supernetting.  Domain objects and general purpose
         extensions.  GSI/Merit/RIPE NCC exchange format is almost finished.

The RIPE Meeting Audiocast

   The 13th RIPE meeting was broadcast "To all of Europe and Israel",
   The audiocast went well at this meeting.  A group of volunteers needs
   to be assembled near strategic points in the physical infrastructure.
   It is to be called, MBONE-EU.  An emergency shut off mechanism needs
   to be installed, if there develops an excessive load on the net.

Network Information Discovery for Users Support (NIDUS WG)

   The NIDUS WG, chaired by Nandor Hovarth, lead a discussion to
   identify services to give to users that will be provided by the RIPE
   database and the RIPE NCC document store.

   Joyce K. Reynolds, in response to her previous NIDUS WG action items
   at the RIPE last meeting, presented the IETF Network Information
   Services Infrastructure (NISI) Working Group's NIC template, and the

Internet Monthly Report                                    February 1993


   "Global Notable NICs" file (see below).  While the Notable NICs file
   it not complete, it is a start.  Joyce also distributed updates to
   the IETF User Services Area's Working Groups and new FYI RFC
   publications (see section, "Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
   User Services Reports", above).

   Milan Sterba commented that the RIPE NIDUS should draw on Jill
   Foster's RARE ISUS group and Joyce Reynolds' IETF User Services
   working groups, as the BBN NNSC's Internet Resource Guide is not
   "global".  The NIDUS group should try to appoint each country to
   provide information of their site.  This information can be collected
   in a central place, in a database (Milan's proposed database).

   Geza Turchanyi commented that there are two ways to approach this:

      1) Plan for the future (Milan's database)
      2) Do what is needed now immediately (Geza's plan)

   NIDUS should start with existing US templates - BBN's template and
   the DDN NIC's template.  These can be obtained from the RARE
   Secretariat.  Milan's reasoning is that collecting information:

      1) can be used for service providers
      2) might be a tool which could be given to the users to help at
         their databases directly.

   It is also good idea to use/include the information already collected
   by Jill Foster's group (RTR 1), but NOT via each national network,
   but by each country, with user support information and local updates.
   The RTR 1 report as a paper copy is too definitive, the RIPE database
   is moving and evolving constantly.

   It was suggested that WAIS is good in aggregating multiple databases.
   It works from the bottom up; local NICs first, then get the
   information on what they are doing.  Not GUIDES, but WHERE one can
   FIND things.  The RIPE NCC should be the right place to store this
   information, once it is collected.  It was decided at the next RIPE
   meeting to focus on database specific issues.  It was also proposed
   to improve the template until the next meeting.  Index information,
   put all information on-line, and connect it directly to the server.

   Nandor commented on how the NIDUS WG should to proceed with their
   work.  There are large amounts of existing documents (informational,
   and so on) that could be made available on the RIPE NCC.  What is
   already out there??  What else could be put in that is not already in
   the database?  Also, put in global NIC information.  Geza and Daniel
   will help with this task.

Internet Monthly Report                                    February 1993


   Milan suggested to define a new RIPE database object for resource
   information, resource guides, and access methods.  There are
   different opinions about this concept.

      1) This information cannot be structured.  The RIPE DB is not the
         best forum to store information.

      2) What kind of information should one collect about resources??
         The RIPE DB is a valuable tool.  Milan will continue to refine and
         resolve this issue.  He will bring and enhanced proposal to the
         next RIPE meeting.

                            NISI WG "NIC-Template"

      The Network Information Services Infrastructure (NISI) Working
      Group in the User Services Area of the IETF is exploring the
      requirements for common, shared Internet-wide network information
      services.  The goal is to develop an understanding for what is
      required to implement an information services "infrastructure" for
      the Internet.  April Marine (SRI International) and Pat Smith
      (Merit) are co-chairs of this group.  The NISI WG has produced an
      FYI RFC on, "Building a Network Information Services
      Infrastructure" (FYI 12, RFC 1302).

      One of their projects is to initiate development of a central
      point where profiles of existing Network Information Centers can
      be maintained for NICs around the world to access.  They also have
      available a mailing list called "nic-forum@merit.edu" to provide
      NIC personnel with a means of soliciting information from other
      NICs, offering solutions to common problems, and posting
      information of general NIC interest.

      Besides providing valuable information, this will be a
      contribution to needed communication between NICs at this level
      and also a boost for the X.500 effort.

      Additional information and the template are included below.  If
      you have further questions please send a message to
      april@nisc.sri.com and psmith@merit.edu.

      The NISI WG co-chairs are excited about this project and are
      looking forward to your participation!

   1)  JOINING the nic-profiles and the nic-forum

      To join the nic-forum, send a note to: nic-forum-
      request@merit.edu.

      To join the nic-profiles, please complete the attached template
      and return to: psmith@merit.edu.  When the template comes back to
      merit.edu, your NIC profile entry will be added to the database.

   2)  MODIFYING INFORMATION -- Who has access?

      Note that the means of allowing access for modifying information
      which is described in the following paragraph is only a temporary
      measure.  Eventually a "modification password" will be required in
      addition to the proper e-mail address.

      When the initial template is completed, one piece of information
      requested is the e-mail address of the NIC contact person
      (contactPersonEmail).  That electronic address becomes the
      "password" for updating your NIC information.  Any corrections or
      changes will be sent to: nic-profile-update@merit.edu.  The
      incoming mail will be checked to ensure that the e-mail address in
      the "From:" field matches the e-mail address of the contact
      person.  If it matches, then the information will be changed.  If
      not, the mail will be returned to sender with an explanatory note.

   3)  ACCESSING NIC-PROFILES

      In order to access X.500, your site must have a Directory User
      Agent (DUA) set up which can speak to Merit's Directory Service
      Agent (DSA).  If the DUA is running all that is necessary is to go
      to Merit's branch of the directory tree which is:

                  @o=Internet@NICProfiles

      If your site doesn't have this capability, send a note to
      psmith@merit.edu for further information.

      Information on availability of X.500 Directory User Agents (DUAs)
      and Directory System Agents (DSAs) is available in FYI 11, RFC
      1292 (" Catalog of Available X.500 Implementations"), written by
      Ruth Lang (SRI International) and Russ Wright (Lawrence Berkeley
      Laboratory) of the Directory Information Services Infrastructure
      (DISI) Working Group in the User Services Area of the IETF.

      For those who do not have X.500 software at their site, efforts
      are underway to provide the capability for updating nic-profiles
      entries and accessing the information using electronic mail.

   4)  NOTES ABOUT THE TEMPLATE

       1.  "objectClass" will always be nicProfile.

       2.  An example of "parentOrganizationName" and "commonName"
           might be:

              parentOrganizationName=Bolt, Beranek and Newman, Inc.;
              commonName=NSF Network Service Center;
              commonName=NNSC

       3.  contactPersonEmail is the "password" that will be
           matched before any changes to the NIC entry can be
           made.

       4.  Under "servicesOffered" please include one-line
           bulleted items, not paragraphs of prose.

      The Template follows.  Please return to psmith@merit.edu: (Note:
      Initially, there will be human interaction in making these
      entries, so don't worry about format, punctuation, spaces, etc.)

The NETF Meeting

      The NETF meeting was held in a suburb outside of Oslo, Norway, with
      approximately 75 attendees.

NORDUnet Services/Events


      -A cisco based system provides better response time.  This is
       a the major event.

      -DECnet out from UNI-C now runs on a cisco.

      -DECnet Phase V experiment is beginning to study this and
       hopes are that this will be an application in the future.

      -Tender/SRNETT project

      -Nordic Schools Project - a collective for schools to
       communication via NORDUnet.

      -Baltic activities

      -Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT).  Set up a "CERT" in
       Stockholm.  Formalized by becoming a member of "FIRST", which
       is a club of "CERTS".  NORDUnet is the first European member of this
       club. "FIRST"'s objective is to obtain information on security holes,
       etc., and find out how to protect sites.

NORDUnet Relations

   NORDUnet will be a part of the common EBONE, starting 3 January 1993.
   It has an operations unit, and is a member of FIRST.  Work is in
   progress to make NORDUnet an "A/S" (that is, making NORDUnet a legal
   body).  NORDUnet is a founding original member of the Internet
   Society.

EBONE in Europe - IP Backbone

   Bernhard Stockman presented a talk on EBONE.  Routing was going on
   before EBONE, but it was cost inefficient.  Wanted optimization for
   technical and economic reasons.  The EBONE backbone currently
   comprises five major sites in Europe.  In 1993, the extensions to the
   backbone will be to an EBONE border system.  This border system will
   be between an extension EBONE and internal sites in Europe.  EBONE
   1993 will include:

Internet Monthly Report                                    February 1993


      -neutral interconnections among all operators.
      -Pan European Backbone (no such thing as yet).
      -sound organization (proper, fair financing)
      -neutrality (no government subsidizing of commercial enterprises)
      -long-term EBONE (3-5 years).

   The EBONE organization in 1992 included:

      ECCO - RBS connections
      EAT (EBONE Action Team) - Engineers
      EOT (EBONE Operations Team) - Operations
      EMC (EBONE Management Committee) - The Board

NETF Nordic Program

   There is a NORDUnet program proposal, which includes:

      -bi-lateral discussions
      -Nordic schools projects (distance education)
      -Library sector
      -"NORDinfo"
      -Research collaboration
      -Sweden/Norwegian activities

   The future program focuses on being able to compete on "equal terms"
   with Europe, the US, and Japan.  Also, to initiate closer ties onto
   "building a chain" between:

      -R&D activities in IT and communication
      -Pilot use of new technology
      -Deployment of technology

   A report has been published (in Swedish).  The evaluation of this
   report has been positive.  A formal request was made for funding, but
   it was turned down, due to bad financial situations.  A new program
   is not possible at this point in time.

   So, what now??  A new program should be based on existing activities.

      -need to develop the ideas into another proposal.
      -should be national level discussion ("lobbying" is needed)
      -immediate support to the NETF is needed
      -NORDREN@searn.sunet.se - will be the email distribution list

NTR - Norwegian Telecom Research

   Per Einar Dybuik presented a talk on the NTR.  A workplan has been
   established, called the CoMMedia initiative (Communication

   Cooperation and Multimedia).  This is a Norwegian Telecom Agreement.
   The workplan will try to establish a major national research project
   in the area of distributed multimedia applications.  The study is not
   in place yet.  The background on this effort came out of an agreement
   at the multimedia seminar on 24 April 92.

   The workplan ambitions include:

      -national distributed multimedia lab
      -interaction with other initiatives
      -identify applications
      -conclusions and future work

      -distributed medical and environmental services
      -entertainment market
      -multimedia document interchange

   Major participants include all major Norwegian universities and
   colleges, UNINETT, Norwegian Telecom, and the National Research
   Council (NRC).

SIREN - A Swedish Initiative in IT and communications

   The goals of the SIREN initiative include:

   -deploy use of IT and communication services to:
      schools, universities, industry, government, etc.

   -find mechanism to turn research results into public use.
      What protocol stacks are needed??

   Pilot user of new transmission/network concept
      Dynamic Time Division (DTM)

   Funding is needed for this project.

Background on a Network Information Services Infrastructure

   Establishment of a NISI (SUNET and NORDUnet)

      -public service providers.

Internet Monthly Report                                    February 1993


      -collaborative research program (Multi G)
      -a "whois" SIREN (with a bottom up approach - not delegated from
       on-high, government entities)

   Research issues:

      -multimedia, distributed, integrated
      -network technology: fiber and mobile
      -host interface design
      -operations system
      -user interface

       level)
      -research profile (educate educator for public market education)
      -international collaboration and industry collaboration

CNI - Coalition of Networked Information

   Craig Summerhill presented a talk on CNI.  CNI was founded in March
   of 1990 by ARL, CAUSE, and EDUCOM.  There is a 9 person steering
   committee, a 150 member task force, 8 working groups, a 3 person
   secretariat, and a variety of network services.

   CNI is content oriented, making the assumption that there are other
   frameworks in existence and promulgating vision statements.  Working
   groups focus on the modernization of scholarly publishing, the
   transformation of scholarly communications, and directories and
   resource information services.  Architecture and standards are looked
   at in the form of legislation, codes, policies and practices.  Access
   to government information, teaching and learning, management and
   professional and user education.  CNI works on networking
   partnerships in research and education.

   CNI project criteria includes:

      -full disclosure
      -collaborative
      -advance state of the art or state of understanding
      -open architecture and standards

Information and User Services Session

      Nordhagen.  Anders Gillner presented a talk on structuring Gopher.
      Joyce Reynolds presented a talk on the current projects in the
      User Services Area of the IETF and the new "Integrated Information
      Architecture" plan put forth by the IESG (see RIPE meeting notes,
      sections, "Network Information Discovery for Users Support" (NIDUS
      WG)", and "Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) User Services
      Reports", above).  Rolf lead a discussion on future ideas and
      activities in the user services realm in the NETF.

NETF Multimedia

      -mime-information exchange - projects, problems, achievements
      -pilot experiments

   MIME is structuring the body of mail

      -identification: What?  encoding: How? (Anything beyond US-ASCII)
      -character sets (binary transfer, multiport)  This is not focussed
       on defining new formats, but a question of labelling

   The status of MIME is that it is now a Proposed Standard Protocol
   (RFC 1341).  The future of MIME:

      -no big changes
      -more body parts
      -better user agents
      -MIME mail servers

   In five years, most Internet mail will use MIME.  To quote Marshall
   Rose, "If MIME is adopted, X.400 is dead."

Distance Education in Scandinavia

   Astrid Jenssen, University of Oslo, presented a talk on distance
   education.  The definition of "distance education" in this talk is,
   any education activity where teacher and students are separated in
   space and/or in time.  The technical media are applied for
   distribution of subject content and for real two-way exchanges.

   The Distance Education Model:

      -Large Scale Model (Large, front end development)
      -Small Scale Model (number of students much smaller)
      -Text based communications

   The most important aspect is two way communication.

Internet Monthly Report                                    February 1993


   This model helps to:

      -facilitate group communication between students, teachers,
       and administrative staff
      -Distribute information
      -Handle assignments
      -Professional, social, and administrative communications
      -asking for help, discussions, group collaboration, and guest
       lecturing
      -information must be organized in different forms

   On-line education activities at USIT

      -pedagogic on-line seminars (provides an introduction to
       on-line uses and protocols) -introduction to Unix (FUNIX)
      -Electronic networking (introduction to TCP/IP-based services (FIK)

   Electronic networking (FIK) goals include to become familiar to the
   services and to get an introduction to network technology.  The
   target group is persons at educational institutions that are linked
   to UNINETT (Norwegian academic network, which is part of the
   Internet).  An on-line educational model includes:

      -face-to-face meetings
      -reproduced written material
      -electronic exercises and individual assignments
      -obligatory use of the server

   Administrative Routines include:

      -developing administrative routines for announcing registrations,
       payments, etc.
      -check local equipment and access to computer network services
      -administrating user accounts (this must be initiated)
      -user support for solving technical problems
      -written material by giving step-by-step guidance (this started
       4 1/2 - 5 years ago)

   There are copyright issues regarding teaching materials.  For
   example, in Music History.  Luckily, the copyright issues in Europe
   are not a bad in the the United States.
