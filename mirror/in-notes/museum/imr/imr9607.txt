INTERNET MONTHLY REPORTS
------------------------

The purpose of these reports is to communicate to the Internet Research
Group the accomplishments, milestones reached, or problems discovered by
the participating organizations.

Each organization is expected to submit a 1/2 page report on the first
business day of the month describing the previous month's activities.
These reports should be submitted via network mail to "IMR@ISI.EDU".

     IETF Monthly Report for July, 1996


     1. The IETF met in Montreal, Quebec, Canada from June 24-28, 1996.
     While we're still working on the numbers, this was the best
     attended meeting in the IETF's history with over 1200 registrants.

     Closing out the year, the IETF will be returning to San Jose,
     California from December 9-13, 1996. Following that, the IETF
     travels to Memphis, Tennessee where Federal Express will be the
     host. This meeting will be held April 7-11, 1997. We are currently
     working on returning to Europe in August, 1997.

     Once all the arrangements have been made, notifications will be
     sent to the IETF Announcement list. Remember that information on
     future IETF meetings can be always be found in the file 0mtg-
     sites.txt which is located on the IETF shadow directories.  This
     information can also be viewed from the IETF Home Page on the Web.
     The URL is:

                             http://www.ietf.org

     2. The minutes of the IESG teleconferences have been publicly
     available on the IETF Shadow directories since 1991. These files

     REGISTRATION SERVICES

     The Following report covers the months of July, August, and
     September:

     I.  Significant Events

     * HostReg and CReg templates are now being processed automatically;
     previously they had to be processed manually; now about 50% are
     being processed automatically.

     * The auto-registration software now sorts requests into six
     groups:  (1) COM, (2) ORG, (3) NET, (4) GOV, (5) EDU and (6) TLD;
     this eliminates a manual step in the process and allows the ability
     to put an increased priority on GOV, EDU and TLD requests.

     * Plans to initiate a night shift are under development to assist
     in reducing the manual processing backlog.

     * Informal training was provided for Billing CSRs regarding how to
     register as a contact.

Internet Monthly Report                                        July 1996


     * Selection and training of a second shift for processing support
     was completed; a full day training class was held on Saturday,
     September 10th; final staffing arrangements were completed for a
     night shift with a start date of September 30th.

     * A "SWAT Team" of existing staff was used to reduce the backlog.

     * Fax processing has become an overwhelming problem, requiring over
     four full-time equivalent employees.

     * Duane Stone and Carley Johnson represented the InterNIC DomReg
     Section at Network World Interop.

     * Testing of a share-ware Fax Server solution is going very well;
     it would make faxes available as e-mail; the fax viewer works very
     well on Sparc 5s and also supports sending faxes out; the MTS and
     Ack/Nak interfaces still need to be completed.

     * DomReg software enhancements have reduced the number of requests
     that need to be processed manually from about 1,000 to 700 (30%
     improvement).

     * A method for gathering performance measurements was finalized and
     documented.

     INTERNIC DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES

     The new Netfind Seed database is up on our machines.  In addition,
     InterNIC Directory and Database Services will become the new home
     of the netfind-servers mailing list.

     We have set up a Web page giving starting points for browsing
     information on the US government.  While most of the entries are
     related to the Federal government, there is also a pointer to some
     information on state and local governments.

     A reminder - if you would like to help the Internet community find
     a resource that you offer, send mail to admin@ds.internic.net and
     we will send information about listing your resource in the
     Directory of Directories.  If you prefer, you can enter information
     about your resource in our WWW suggestion form.  The form can be
     reached through our Directory of Directories Web page at:

     THE US DOMAIN REGISTRY
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     The US Domain now has an online line registration form.

     Some of the processing of the requests to the third level domain
     name is now automated. In particular, most requests to register
     names in localities already delegated are automatically forwarded
     to the administrator for that locality.

     The US Domain administrator no longer makes direct registrations of
     hosts, and only makes delegations of third or fourth level domain
     names (such as localities).

     A new policy has been added to the criteria for delegating domain
     names under the US Domain:

        It is the intention that the delegation of third level (for
        example, locality) domain names be wide spread to many
        registries.  It is undesirable for one person or organization to
        manage a large part of the third level names in any particular
        geographic or logical area.

Internet Monthly Report                                        July 1996


        No individual or organization shall have more than 500
        delegations total in the US Domain as a whole, or more than 50
        delegation in any particuilar second level (for example, a
        state).

     To obtain a copy of the list of other delegated localities and
     subdomains not administered by the US Domain Registrar, get the

MERIT INTERNET ENGINEERING
--------------------------

     This report summarizes July 1996 activities of Merit's Internet
     Engineering group on behalf of the Routing Arbiter (RA) service and
     other projects.

     The Routing Arbiter project has updated its packet loss and latency
     measurement code to correct recently discovered measurement biases
     (see http://www.ra.net/statistics/rs.html).  Previously, the packet
     loss and latency measurements were carried out using the standard
     Sun ping, which sent five ICMP echo request packets to each of the
     Route Servers' BGP peers every fifteen minutes.  The response time
     (or lack of response) was logged in a file and later downloaded and
     processed.  Periodically, aberrant measures were seen.  For
     example, there was often packet loss/or and high latency when the
     machine ping'd its own interface.  Packet loss data indicated
     higher loss and latency results than did other measures.

Internet Monthly Report                                        July 1996


     Because Merit did not have the source code for the Sun ping, the
     engineering staff could not perform a detailed analysis to
     determine the cause of the problem.  Staff did find, however, that
     the Cornell ping, to which they did have source code, did not
     display the same anomalies and provided much more credible
     measurements.  As a result, a new data collection methodology has
     been implemented using the Cornell ping as a basis for the
     measurements.  The data from all the Route Servers now shows
     improved Internet performance in comparison with the previous
     months' data.  To provide data for further study, the primary Route
     Server at the Washington, D.C. NAP (MAE-East) is running the old
     and new pings in parallel.  Comparing the two sets of results
     should shed additional light on the source of bias between the two
     measurement methodologies, and potentially permit an adjustment to
     deflate the previous measurements.

     Merit has been exploring options for resolving an important
     operational problem of the Route Servers, i.e., how to detect
     whether or not peers of the Route Servers have direct layer-2
     reachability to each other.  Though this issue was raised at one of
     the ATM NAPs, it would be problematic for any non-broadcast-media
     NAP, and is an important issue with respect to the reliability of
     both routing and the Route Servers.  Currently, Merit and the
     Information Sciences Institute, its partner in the RA project, are
     evaluating the feasibility of obtaining layer-2 reachability
     information directly from Route Server peers via ICMP-level queries
     (traceroute with strict source routing).  This is ultimately the
     source of the desired information and can be initiated by the Route
     Server without requiring SNMP access coordination and community
     string dissemination.

     Merit has implemented an incremental update client for the copies
     it maintains of the databases in the Internet Routing Registry.
     This client will poll primary IRR sites for updates on a regular
     basis (most likely every ten minutes). Currently, these sites only
     provide updated copies of the registries on a daily basis, so this
     technology will significantly improve the timeliness of the IRR
     data provided by RAWhoisd, the whois.ra.net whois server.

     The incremental update client has been in final test for the last
     weeks of July and will be deployed in early August.  Initially,
     only the RIPE registry will provide incremental updates.  However,
     we hope that all IRR registries will eventually adopt this
     technology.

Internet Monthly Report                                        July 1996


     A new RA tool prototype, known as NetNow, combines a variety of
     real- time network statistics to provide an easy-to-use, graphical
     display of ongoing core Internet network conditions.  See:

                            http://www.ra.net/tools/

     A map of the United States shows the four Network Access Points,
     and a menu bar lists the major U.S. Internet Service Providers.
     Names on the map and provider list are color-coded to indicate
     whether conditions are normal at the NAP or on the provider's
     backbone, or whether there are problems such as high packet loss or
     latency, excessive route flapping, unreachable networks, or
     scheduled maintenance outages.  Information about the NAPs is
     collected by ICMP pings to Route Server peers and SNMP queries to
     the Route Servers.  The ISP backbones are monitored by sending ICMP
     pings from each NAP across each provider backbone to every other
     NAP (creating a mesh).  In the near future, pings will also be sent
     across the major ISP backbones to popular end sites.  This process
     will test inter-provider connectivity and provide some statistics
     on the performance of provider tail circuits.

     A new software package called "Scion" is being developed by Merit's
     NetSCARF (Network Statistics Collection And Reporting Facility)
     project.  Scion can be used by ISPs to collect network statistics
     and automatically display performance reports on the World Wide
     Web.  Version 1.2 of the code is available from:

                         http://www.merit.edu/~netscarf

     The Scion code, derived from the initial NSFNET project's
     statistics collection and reporting activities, is easy to install
     and runs automatically.  Every fifteen minutes, Scion's optimized
     SNMP library queries ISP routers for the values of variables such
     as sysUpTim and ifLastChange.  The library uses SNMP Version 1, and
     can be configured to use SNMPv2u, the User-based Security model for
     SNMPv2.  Scion's SNMP API is unique, in that it allows the
     developer to specify a list of nodes, a community string (or
     userid/authentication password/privacy password in the case of
     SNMPv2u), and a list of management objects to retrieve. All queries
     are then transmitted back-to-back, without waiting for any replies.
     The data collection activity is thus very fast, and the results
     highly synchronized.  Other publicly available SNMP libraries force
     applications to wait for a response (or timeout) for a given query
     before the next query can be issued to a different node.

Internet Monthly Report                                        July 1996


     The raw SNMP statistics are pre-processed each evening, and the
     processed data delivered to CGI scripts, using what the developers
     believe to be the first public domain implementation of the OpStats
     (RFC 1856) client/server model.  Finally, ISP performance reports
     based on the 'cooked' data are displayed on the Web via the CGI
     scripts.

     ISPs can use the Scion code to automatically produce HTML graphs
     showing system uptime, interface uptime, and total network traffic
     measured in packets.  An advanced statistics Web page allows users
     to specify customized graphing parameters.

     The source and pre-compiled executables are available for the BSDi
     and SunOS platforms.  Release 2, scheduled for October 1996, will
     include ports to Windows NT, AIX, and perhaps Solaris and LINUX.

     A technical overview of the software package has been written by
     project manager Bill Norton and lead architect Andy Adams, and
     appears in the July ConneXions (Vol. 10 No. 7).  Norton gave a talk
     about NetSCARF and Scion at the Network Management Area Open
     Meeting at the Montreal IETF (June '96) and at a network statistics
     BOF following the May NANOG meeting.  A new mailing list,
     netscarf@merit.edu, is a forum for community discussion and input
     to the project.  Further information is available at the URL above.
