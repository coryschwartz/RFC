INTERNET ENGINEERING REPORTS
----------------------------

     1. Let me remind everyone that the next IETF meeting will be in
        Dallas, Texas from December 4-8, 1995, with the Newcomers'
        Orientation and Registration Reception being held on Sunday,
        December 3. The Dallas IETF meeting is being hosted by MCI.
        Logistic information has been posted to the IETF Announcement
        list, and the Secretariat is accepting registrations. The IETF
        meeting fee for the Dallas meeting will be $200.

        Following Dallas, the IETF will be meeting in Los Angeles,
        California from March 4-8, 1996. There will not be a local host
        for this meeting, but the terminal room facilities will be
        provided by Interop. Following Los Angeles, the IETF will be
        meeting in Montreal, Quebec, Canada from June 24-28, 1996. If
        this date looks familiar, it is the same date as INET '96! This
        is not a "joint" meeting, but both will be held in the Montreal
        Convention Center.

        Once all the arrangements have been made, notifications will be
        sent to the IETF Announcement list. Remember that information
        on future IETF meetings can be always be found in the file
        0mtg-sites.txt which is located on the IETF shadow directories.
        This information can also be viewed from the IETF Home Page on
        the Web. The URL is:

                     http://www.ietf.cnri.reston.va.us


     2. The minutes of the IESG teleconferences have been publicly
        available on the IETF Shadow directories since 1991. These files
        are placed in the /ftp/iesg directory.

        The following IESG minutes have been added:

           September 28, 1995 (iesg.95-09-28)
           October 12, 1995 (iesg.95-10-12)

FEDERAL NETWORKING COUNCIL (FNC)
-------------------------------

     Unanimous passage of a resolution by the Federal Networking Council
     (FNC) on 10/24/95 supporting the following definition of
     "Internet".

         RESOLUTION:

         "The Federal Networking Council (FNC) agrees that the following
         language reflects our definition of the term "Internet".

         "Internet" refers to the global information system that --

         (i) is logically linked together by a globally unique address
         space based on the Internet Protocol (IP) or its subsequent
         extensions/follow-ons;

         (ii) is able to support communications using the Transmission
         Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite or its
         subsequent extensions/follow-ons, and/or other IP-compatible
         protocols; and

         (iii) provides, uses or makes accessible, either publicly or
         privately, high level services layered on the communications
         and related infrastructure described herein."

     This definition was developed in consultation with the leadership
     of the Internet and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Communities.
     The FNC expects that the definition may be included in legislation
     which is currently before the Congress.

     The second item is the Workshop Announcement / Call for Papers
     related to Improving Internet Security.  This workshop is an
     outgrowth of the Federal Networking Council Security Working
     Group's efforts related to the Federal Internet Security Plan
     (FISP).

FEDERAL INTERNET SECURITY WORKSHOP
==================================

     Federal Internet Security Workshop
     Call for Position Papers

     An Invitational Workshop on Improving Internet Security

     Date: February 20-21, 1996
     San Diego, CA

     In September 1995, the Federal Networking Council Security Working
     Group (FNC/SWG) published the draft Federal Internet Security Plan
     (FISP). The framework presented in this Plan focusses on the
     Internet in its broadest sense, with the U.S. Government presented
     as a major user. It addresses Internet security requirements,
     including interoperability, from the perspective of the goals and
     objectives outlined in the National Performance Review (NPR),
     http://www.npr.gov/.

     The FISP is available at the following URL:
     http://www.fnc.gov/SWG.html .

     The framework presented in the FISP is targetted toward improving
     the security of Federal Internet operations and raising the state
     of practice of Internet security by the Federal and other sectors
     through a collaborative effort. It recognizes the influential role
     that the Government plays as a major sponsor of
     communications/computing R&D and as a purchaser of mature products.
     The approach is also intended

     to highlight the critical interface between Federal and commercial
     users / developers of Internet services and technologies. This
     approach has been developed in consultation with members of the
     Federal Networking Council Advisory Committee (FNCAC), a group with
     representation from industry, academia, and the non-profit sectors.

     Objectives:

     This workshop will bring together principal players in the Federal
     and overall Internet community to discuss the problems and
     challenges of security on the Internet. It will also form the
     foundation for industry and government strategies for implementing
     specific FISP recommendations during 1996 / 1997.

     The workshop will have as its objectives...

     * Revise and extend the Federal Internet Security Plan (FISP)

Internet Monthly Report                                     October 1995


     * Describe "best practice" examples related to Internet security.
     * Develop specific strategies for implementing FISP action items,
       involving various sectors of the Internet community.
     * Identify the fundamental issues, requirements, and recommendations
       related to future Internet Security research and development efforts.

     Participants:

     Participation in the workshop will be by invitation, primarily
     based on submitted position papers which will be reviewed by the
     steering and program committees. Additional individuals may be
     invited to ensure that participation reflects a broad cross-section
     of key players in the Internet community. The material submitted
     will be a part of the record of the workshop.

     Although a principal focus of the workshop will be on the FISP, the
     Federal Networking Council recognizes that there is no easily
     partitionable "Federal" part of the Internet and that the entire
     global community must be part of any solutions to its security
     problems. Therefore, the FISP and the workshop are oriented toward
     a scalable continuing improvement process, based on common
     principles and mechanisms compatible with the values of the
     community and their needs.

     Schedule:

     Call for participation - November 6, 1995
     Position Papers Due - December 8, 1995
     Invitations to Participants - January 8, 1996
     Workshop - February 21-22, 1996

     REGISTRATION SERVICES

     I.  Significant Events

     InterNIC Registration Services assigned over 9,843 network
     addresses and registered over 20,315 domains.  There were three
     top-level country domains registered during October: Mauritius
     (MU), Brunei (BN), and Ethiopia (ET).

     As of October 13, 1995 the InterNIC Registry announced the
     availability of the domain registration forms under the web for
     both new submissions as well as modifications to existing domains.
     The url is http://rs.internic.net/reg/reg-forms.html

     Revision 1 to the Domain Name Dispute Policy is available for
     review by the internet community.  The policy (Revision 01) will be
     effective November 23, 1995.

     During the month of October, domain requests continue to average
     between 1,000 - 1,400 for new submissions per day. Adjustments
     continue to be made in domain programs/processing.  At the close of
     October 1995, the domain backlog had decreased from 7,000+ to
     1,000+ new domain registration requests.

     II.  Current Status

     During the month of October 1995, InterNIC Registration Services
     received communications as shown below.  The majority of the
     correspondence concerned the assignment and re-assignment of
     network numbers and the registration or change of domain names:

          E-mail     47,925     (hostmaster@internic.net)
          Postal/Fax    251    (primarily IP number requests)
          Phone      16,180

     The Registrations Services host computer supported a large volume
     of information retrieval requests during the month of October:

                     Connections   Retrievals
          Gopher      48,534           79,089

          Telnet      85,426
          Http       715,930

     In addition, for WHOIS the number of queries were:

                       Client        Server
                      505,651       3,387,819

     INTERNIC DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES

     The NIC Locator database, hosted by InterNIC Directory and
     Database Services, provides the Internet community a place to look
     up information about Network Information Centers attached to the
     Internet.  NIC Locator was built by the IETF Network Information
     Services Infrastructure working group to provide a place on the
     Internet for NICs to advertise their services.

     If you'd like to view the NIC Locator database, take a look at

             http://ds.internic.net/ds/niclocate.html

     If you'd like advertise a NIC, or know of a NIC that should be
     advertised, contact the NIC Liaison at InterNIC Registration
     Services (liaison@internic.net).

     In October, InterNIC Directory and Database Services upgraded its
     Web to X.500 gateways

              http://www.internic.net/ds/x500.html

     to support two X.500 attributes as hyperlinks: the new "Labeled
     URI" attribute and the RFC822 e-mail address attribute.  The
     former attribute is now being accepted by the InterNIC in entries
     it maintains for organizations and persons.  An organization can
     now be looked up via the Web to X.500 gateway with a Web browser
     and the labeled URI attribute-hyperlink followed to its Web home
     page.  Similarly, a person can be looked up with the Web browser

     and, assuming the browser supports the "mailto" URL scheme, be
     sent e-mail directly from the browser simply by clicking on the
     "mail" attribute.

     A reminder - if you would like to help the Internet community find
     a resource that you offer, send mail to admin@ds.internic.net and
     we will send information about listing your resource in the

     THE US DOMAIN REGISTRY

     The US Domain Registry has installed a client/server Rwhois protocol
     to support the US Domain WHOIS information.  We register third level
     delegations.  For example, K12.IL.US, TACOMA.WA.US, or STATE.MN.US
     would have entries in the US WHOIS database. To look up a US domain
     name, do the following:

             whois -h nii.isi.edu <domain-name>

MERIT INTERNET ENGINEERING
--------------------------

     This report summarizes recent activities of Merit's Internet
     Engineering group on behalf of the Routing Arbiter (RA) service
     and other projects.

     Performance statistics for the Route Servers (RS) at
     interconnection points are now online on the RA Web pages:

         http://www.ra.net/routing.arbiter/RA/statistics/.rs.html

     The following graphical and text-based reports are available:

     > DELAY/PACKET LOSS - Packet loss and round-trip delay in milli-
       seconds for five ping packets sent from each Route Server to
       its peer routers. The data is recorded at 15-minute intervals,
       processed, analyzed, and presented in a graphical format.
       Packet latency across the interconnection point media is
       categorized into four exclusive categories (0-10 ms, 10-100 ms,
       100-1000 ms, and >1000ms) and presented graphically over time.

     > BGP PEERING - Number of BGP updates received from each peer,
       recorded at 15-minute intervals. In a very rough sense, the
       routing stability of the global Internet can be measured by
       the number and frequency of BGP messages.

     > SYSTEM UPTIME - Percentage and length of time in minutes of
       Route Server uptime, number of system failures, and maximum
       downtime. (Text only.)







Cooper                                                         [Page 21]

Internet Monthly Report                                     October 1995


     > FREE VIRTUAL MEMORY - Samples of free virtual memory taken at
       five minute intervals to monitor Route Server memory management.
       The Route Server maintains multiple images of its routing tables
       to support policy-based routing with a potentially large number of
       peers.  RS memory usage is thus a critical issue, given the size
       and growth rate of the Internet.

     The reports for delay/packet loss, BGP peering, and virtual memory
     are currently only available for Route Server/ANS peering at the
     Washington, D.C. NAP (MAE-East.)  Merit has collected many months
     of data from all the interconnection points, and soon expects to
     report additional performance statistics for the AADS, PacBell, and
     Sprint NAPs and MAE- West.  The statistics are processed and
     analyzed by Dun Liu of Merit.

     Two new Routing Arbiter Database (RADB) reports provide valuable
     information about routes registered in the RADB and the status of
     CIDR aggregation in the Internet Routing Registry.  The new reports
     are:

     > COUNTS OF RADB PREFIXES BY LENGTH - The number of Route objects
       registered in the RADB, with active and withdrawn routes listed
       by prefix length.  Data from the current week is available from:

         ftp://ftp.ra.net/routing.arbiter/radb/reports/
             counts-by-prefix/Summarize_prefix.current

       Reports from previous weeks are available from:

          ftp://ftp.ra.net/routing.arbiter/radb/reports/
                counts-by-prefix/summarize_prefix.yymmdd


     > IRR ROUTES SUMMARIZED BY PREFIX LENGTH WITH AGGREGATION - A
       summary of unique prefixes registered in the IRR.  Routes are
       summarized by the first octet of the network number.  If routes
       within a prefix can be aggregated, a count is printed for each
       prefix length that has a different count after aggregation. Data
       from the current week is available from:

         ftp://ftp.ra.net/routing.arbiter/radb/reports/
             IRR_profile/IRR_Profile.current

       Reports from previous weeks are available from:

     Brian Renaud presented a Routing Arbiter status report at the
     22nd RIPE meeting in Amsterdam.  A copy of his presentation is
     available from:

         ftp://ftp.ra.net/routing.arbiter/radb/presentations/
           RIPE-22_renaud_routing.ps

     The RIPE attendees expressed significant interest in the RA's
     implementation of PGP-based authentication for the RADB.
     Instructions for using PGP with the RADB are available from:

         http://www.ra.net/routing.arbiter/RA/bgp.html

     Craig Labovitz attended the Very High Speed Networking Conference
     sponsored by the University of Maryland.  A focus of discussion at
     the meeting was the use of ATM technology in next-generation
     networks.  Elise Gerich attended meetings of the Federal
     Engineering Planning Group and Federal Networking Council Advisory
     Committee (FNCAC) in Washington, D.C.  At the FNCAC, she discussed
     ways in which the Routing Arbiter service can help plan and
     facilitate federal R&E network connectivity in the post-NSFNET era.

     Crowcroft attended an ACM SIG Chairs meeting, and some planning of
     SIGCOMM 96 (stanford) and SIGCOMM 97 (Cannes/Nice area of south of
     france) was done.

     Since leading edge Internet Research generally appears first in
     SIGCOMM or in the SIGs newsletter, CCR, we think it is of general
     interest to readers of this report.

     The SIG's WWW page is at: http://www.ohiou.edu/~gwetzel/sigcomm/
     and links to back issues of CCR can be found there as well as our
     SIG's standards tracking reports.

     Comments are always welcome.
