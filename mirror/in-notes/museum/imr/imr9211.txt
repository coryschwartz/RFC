IAB MESSAGE

   A. REORGANIZATION

   Following the MIT IETF meeting in July 1992, the POISED working group
   was chartered by the IESG to develop proposals for modification of
   the management structure of the IETF.  Three weeks ago, POISED
   reported to the IETF meeting in Washington D.C.  Many discussions
   during the meeting led to a concensus proposal that was presented to
   the Thursday evening "open IESG" plenary.  Most of the people who
   have been participating in the POISED WG agreed to this proposal, at
   least in principle, and the Thursday plenary expressed approval.

   There are two major components to this proposal.

   (1) New Assignment of Responsibilities

    *  Responsibility for approving Internet Standards progression
       will be devolved from the IAB to the IESG.

       The IESG will make the final decision on the progression of
       specification documents through the Internet standards track,
       following the procedures as defined in RFC-1310 or a future
       replacement.  The IESG is preparing to increase its technical
       review capacity to take on this additional work.

    *  The IAB will serve as an adjudication board, to which appeals
       may be made on actions of any kind, including IESG actions on
       the progression of Internet Standards.

    *  The IAB will continue to serve the community with an
       increasingly strong focus on architectural and long-term
       planning.  This may result in launching new initiatives in
       the IETF and/or IRTF.

    *  The IAB will also review the charters for new IETF working
       groups.

   (2) New Selection Procedures

     * Each member of the IESG and IAB will have a two-year term;
       an incumbent may however be re-nominated when a term expires.
       Terms will be staggered so 50% expire each year.

     * Candidates for open IAB and IESG seats will be selected by a
       "nominating committee" composed of 7 people selected at random
       from a pool of people who have met certain criteria and have

Internet Monthly Report                                    November 1992


       volunteered to be in the pool. These 7 will be assisted by
       three non-voting "advisory" members, one each from the IAB,
       the IESG, and the IRSG. The result will be a list of candidates,
       at least one for each open seat.

       Selection of members from this candidate list will be performed
       by the ISOC trustees in the case of IAB members, and by the IAB
       in the case of IESG members.

   The IAB and IESG support these changes and are prepared to institute
   them as quickly and smoothly as possible.  Half of the members of
   both boards will vacate their seats, to allow completion of the
   transition by the March 1993 IETF meeting.

   However, before they can be implemented, many details must be worked
   out, and the Board of Trustees of the Internet Society must approve
   the resulting change in the charter under which the IAB operates.
   The question will be presented to them on December 10.

   In anticipation of the changes, standards approvals have now been
   devolved to the IESG.

   B. SUMMARY OF STANDARDS TRACK

   The following table summarizes the Internet standards track as of
   December 4, 1992.

   The first segment of the table shows the specifications that have
   reached Internet Standard status since September 1, 1991.  The
   following two segments respectively list all Draft Standard and
   Proposed Standard status specifications.  Within each segment,
   entries are ordered by increasing date of last action, and within the
   same month, by increasing RFC number.

   Those dates prefixed with "*" give the approval date; however, the
   date of RFC publication determines the effective date of the action
   for determining time-in-grade.

   The following table summarizes all standards actions taken since
   September 1, 1991 that resulted in removing specifications from the
   standards track.  These actions were recommended by the IESG and
   adopted by the IAB, in accordance with the procedures defined in RFC
   1310.

   Some of these were obsoleted by later versions (as noted).  The rest
   were the result of rationalizing the situation from before the
   institution of the formal procedures specified in RFC 1310.

INTERNET ENGINEERING REPORTS
----------------------------

     1. The 25th meeting of the IETF, hosted by Sprint, was held in
        Washington DC from November 16-20. There were 690 registered
        attendees, a slight increase over the level achieved at the
        Boston IETF meeting held last July.  We are currently entering
        attendee data and information from the Working Group rosters...
        and waiting for some to submit their minutes and reports for
        inclusion in the meeting proceedings.

        Following up on activities from the Cambridge IETF meeting last
        July, the 25th meeting opened with technical presentations on
        IPv7 candidates and proposals. Later in the week, a BOF was held
        to list and define criteria to be used for the evaluation of the
        various proposals.

        A presentation was made by the Poised working group on Tuesday
        and, following countless discussions and meetings, was the
        primary topic of discussion during the IESG Open Plenary where a
        concensus proposal was submitted to the IETF for disucsion. A
        follow up presentation will take place in December when the plan
        will be presented to the ISOC Board of Trustees.

     2. I am pleased to announce that Stev Knowles has joined the IESG,
        and will serve with Phil Almquist as a Co-Area Director of the
        Internet Area.  Stev is filling a slot left open when Noel
        Chiappa resigned.  The Internet Area is an active one, and the
        addition of Stev will provide additional support to the area's
        activities.

     3. The next IETF meeting is scheduled for Columbus, Ohio from March
        29th through April 2, 1993 (yes, this does mean that the IESG
        Open Plenary will be held on April first). The meeting is being
        co-hosted by OARNet and The Ohio State University. There will be
        a registration reception on Sunday, March 28. Logistic and
        registration information will be forthcoming from the IETF
        Secretariat.

        The 27th meeting of the IETF, scheduled for July of 1993, will
        be held in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and will be co-hosted by
        SURFnet and RARE. This will be the first time an IETF meeting
        has been held outside of North America. Negotiations are still
        in progress for the meeting facilities and catering
        arrangements, and there will be a higher fee for this meeting
        (estimated to be $200). More information will be provided as it
        becomes available.

     CONCERT Report for October / November
     -------------------------------------

     The MCNC Center for Communications received a three year grant from
     the NSF to support its Clearinghouse for Networked Information
     Discovery and Retrieval (CNIDR). CNIDR is working closely with the
     IETF working groups and other international associations to further
     the development and appropriate uses of networked information. As
     one its its first focal points, the CNIDR will work with developers
     of WAIS tools toward providing compatibility and consistency, and,
     to the extent possible, convergence of the tools.

     The HILDA HiPPI network analysis system has been used extensively
     to debug and test the VISTAnet Gigabit network testbed.  We have
     measured the network usage and performance characteristics of the
     VISTAnet medical application.  Initial traffic analysis indicates:

        a)  Very bursty interpacket arrival times.
        b)  Very high correlation coefficients.
        c)  Fixed size packets.  Packets are either very short or
            very long.
        d)  Average data rate of 153Mbps during the bursty traffic
            times.

     The HILDA HiPPI network analysis system was demonstrated and used
     at the Supercomputing 92 conference.  Both Input/Output Systems
     Corporation and Los Alamos National Labs brought a HILDA system.
     Measurements were made on the performance and characteristics of
     network traffic between the show floor (at the Minneapolis
     Convention center) and the Cray Research facility at Eagan MN.
     These sites were separated by 40km.  These measurements represent
     the first High Speed Network measurements for a long distance HiPPI
     network of general purpose network traffic.

     XTP (Xpress Transfer Protocol) is now operational on our CRAY Y-MP
     under UNICOS 6.16.  Version 3.5 of XTP from Protocol Engines was
     ported to the CRAY and tested over the high speed HiPPI network
     interface.  No performance figures are available yet. This is the
     first use of alternate transport and network protocols over the
     high speed HiPPI network from a CRAY Y-MP.

     Representatives from several small North Carolina Colleges attended
     a meeting held at CONCERT in order to help them evaluate potential
     Internet connections.

     CONCERT staff assisted with debugging and testing the INRIA
     Videoconferencing System (IVS) which was used to broadcast part of
     the Washington DC IETF meeting. A version of IVS using the Tk
     toolkit, instead of the original MOTIF toolkit, was developed and
     made available via anonymous FTP from ftp.concert.net.

     Several CONCERT staff members attended the 25th IETF meeting held
     in Washington DC.

     MULTIMEDIA CONFERENCING

     At the November IETF meeting, there were several advances on the
     teleconferencing front.  This was the third meeting to be
     "audiocast" and the second to include video, this time over the
     MBONE (virtual multicast backbone) built up in a more coordinated
     manner from the ad-hoc collection of multicast tunnels used in
     July.

     In the Audio/Video Transport WG chaired by Steve Casner, a draft
     specification for the Realtime Transport Protocol, based on
     previous WG discussion, was presented by Henning Schulzrinne.  We
     reached consensus on most of the open issues.  A collection of
     Internet-Drafts will be released very soon.  In the third session,
     we heard presentations on the software video compression algorithms
     being used in various programs and discussed how we might achieve
     interoperation among them.

     Eve Schooler led two impromptu BOF sessions on Conference Control
     (sometimes referred to as connection or configuration management).
     The aim of these discussions was to understand how such a group
     might contribute to the remote conferencing architecture effort.
     It was agreed that there is a need for a session layer control
     protocol to perform higher layer functions than the protocol
     proposed in the AVT WG.  The beginnings of design criteria for this
     protocol were identified.  See the minutes in the IETF proceedings
     for further details.

     Eve Schooler and Steve Casner attended the 3rd International
     Workshop on Network and Operating System Support for Digital Audio
     and Video and presented a paper "The Impact of Scaling on a
     Multimedia Connection Architecture".

NORTHWESTNET
------------

     A recently awarded NSF grant has paved the way for a collaborative
     effort between NorthWestNet, the University of Washington College
     of Engineering, and the University of Washington Computing &
     Communications to recruit and retain students with disabilities
     into the sciences and engineering.  The grant's Steering Committee
     is now laying the foundation for implementation of this three-year
     program.

     Participating high school sophomores and juniors with disabilities
     will be paired with a mentor group of scientists and engineers,
     most of whom are themselves disabled.  Participants will be
     provided with access to electronic mail and Internet resources and
     trained to use these tools.  This common forum will allow students
     and mentors to discuss science and issues concerning disabilities
     throughout the year.

     Each summer the students will participate in a two-week long,
     live-in program at the University.  During this time they will
     study science and engineering using computer applications,
     educational software, electronic mail, and Internet resources.  In
     addition, quarterly workshops will be held to educate faculty,
     staff, and students about the barriers faced by students with
     disabilities and offer practical approaches for removing those
     barriers.

     NorthWestNet's role in this grant will focus on providing Internet
     access to the participants: training them to use e-mail, FTP, and
     Telnet so that they can fully utilize the Internet's resources and
     providing on-going support for use of these resources.

NSFNET/ANSNET BACKBONE ENGINEERING
----------------------------------

             There are two reports for ANSNET/NSFNET this month,
             October and November.


     OCTOBER 1992

     T3 Backbone Status
     ==================

     During October, the T3 network router software was upgraded to
     support 10,000 destination networks with up to four routes per
     destination.  Development work in support of migration to GATED
     routing software continues on schedule.

     Problems that were addressed in October included a major routing
     software bug that resulted in 3 separate routing instability
     events, an RS960 memory parity problem, and an AIX TCP software



Cooper                                                         [Page 32]

Internet Monthly Report                                    November 1992


     bug.  The phase-4 backbone upgrade activities were completed in
     October.

     Significant positive experience was gained with the RS960 FDDI
     interface in October that will lead to additional FDDI deployments
     on T3 ENSS nodes.

     The preparations continued for dismantling of the T1 backbone which
     is scheduled for November.  Activities included testing of OSI CLNP
     encapsulation over the T1 backbone, deployment of the redundant
     backup circuits for the T3 ENSS gateways at each regional network,
     collection of network source/destination traffic statistics on the
     T3 backbone, and cutover of the ESnet networks to the T3 backbone.
     The EASInet and CA*Net systems are not yet using the T3 backbone,
     and will be cutover in November.

     Backbone Traffic and Routing Statistics
     =======================================

     The total inbound packet count for the T1 network was
     4,213,308,629, up 20.0% from September.  469,891,322 of these
     packets entered from the T3 network.

     The total inbound packet count for the T3 network was
     18,940,301,000 up 20.8% from September.  185,369,688 of these
     packets entered from the T1 network.

     The combined total inbound packet count for the T1 and T3 networks
     (less cross network traffic) was 22,498,348,619 up 20.1% from
     September.

     As of October 31, the number of networks configured in the NSFNET
     Policy Routing Database was 7354 for the T1 backbone, and 7046 for
     the T3 backbone.  Of these, 1343 networks were never announced to
     the T1 backbone and 1244 were never announced to the T3 backbone.
     For the T1, the maximum number of networks announced to the
     backbone during the month (from samples collected every 15 minutes)
     was 5378; on the T3 the maximum number of announced networks was
     5124.  Average announced networks on 10/31 were 5335 to T1, and
     5085 to T3.

     Routing Software on the T3 Network
     ==================================

     During October, the T3 network routing and system software was
     upgraded to support an increased on-card routing table size on the
     RS960 interfaces (T3/FDDI) and T960 interface (T1/ethernet) to
     10,000 destination networks with up to 4 alternate routes per



Cooper                                                         [Page 33]

Internet Monthly Report                                    November 1992


     destination network.  The previous limit was 6000 destinations
     networks with up to 4 alternate routes per destination.

     A serious routing bug was exposed that caused instabilities across
     the entire T3 system during three different events, the first on
     10/19, and the 2nd & 3rd on 10/23.  We successfully installed a new
     version of rcp_routed software on all T3 backbone nodes to fix the
     problem.  This bug involved the interface between the routing
     daemon, and the SNMP subagent.  With the addition of the 86th AS
     peer on the T3 backbone, the buffer between the routing daemon and
     the SNMP subagent would get corrupted and induce a failure of the
     routing software.

     With the increased number of routes in the on-card routing tables,
     we have begun to observe problems with the performance for route
     installs/deletes between the on-card forwarding tables, and the AIX
     kernel.  During transient routing conditions we may experience high
     card/system traffic due to route downloads which can cause
     transient instabilities.  We plan to deploy new software that will
     improve the efficiency for route installs/deletes between the on-
     card forwarding tables, and the AIX kernel in November.

     Also during November, we plan to install new routing software that
     will support static routes.  This can be used for situations where
     there is no peer router available to announce the shared interface
     and any networks behind it.  This version of the routing software
     will also selectively filter routes out of the local routing tables
     on a network and/or AS basis.  The software will also increase the
     limit to 16 peer AS numbers per ENSS, and improve the checks for
     the size of BGP updates and attributes.

     The development of GATED software to replace the rcp_routed
     software base is proceeding on schedule.  During October, the BGP4
     protocol was developed and unit tested in GATED along with the
     interim link state IGP that will be used to interoperate with
     internal nodes running rcp_routed.  We expect to deploy GATED
     software on the T3 network in early 1993 following the upgrade to
     the AIX 3.2 operating system.

     RS960 Memory Parity Problem
     ===========================

     During October, we continued to experience some problems on CNSS
     nodes due to the failure of parity checking logic within the on-
     card memory on selected RS960 T3 adapters.  These problems have
     largely been isolated to a few specific nodes including CNSS97
     (Denver), CNSS32 (New York), and CNSS40 (Cleveland).  These outages
     do not generally result in ENSS isolation from the network since



Cooper                                                         [Page 34]

Internet Monthly Report                                    November 1992


     only a single interface will be affected, and redundant
     connectivity is employed on other CNSS interfaces.  The problem can
     be cleared by a software reset of the interface.  Some of these
     problems have been alleviated with hardware replacement (e.g.
     CNSS97 in Denver).

     AIX TCP Software Problem
     ========================

     During October we experienced a problem involving TCP session
     deadlock involving I-BGP sessions between particular ENSS routers.
     A bug was found in the TCP implementation of the AIX 3.1 operating
     system (same bug in BSD) where an established TCP session between
     two ENSS routers (e.g. for I-BGP information transfer) would hang
     and induce a high traffic condition between an RS960 T3 interface
     and the RS/6000 system processor.  This would cause one of the ENSS
     routers on either end of the TCP session to suffer from performance
     problems, until the problem was cleared with a reboot.  This
     problem occurred on several ENSS nodes in October including ENSS134
     (Boston), ENSS144 (Ames), ENSS131 (Ann Arbor), and ENSS129
     (Champaign).

     A fix to this problem was identified, and successfully tested in
     October.  This will be released as part of a new system software
     build for the RS/6000 router in November.

     Phase-4 Deployment Complete
     ===========================

     The phase-4 network upgrade was completed in October '92.  The
     final steps in the upgrade involved the installation of CNSS36 in
     the New York POP, and the completion of T3 DSU PROM upgrades.  The
     DSU firmware upgrade supports new c-bit parity monitoring features,
     and incorporates several bug fixes.

     RS960 FDDI Deployment Status
     ============================

     Since the installation of the new RS960 FDDI adapters for the
     RS/6000 router on ENSS128 (Palo Alto), ENSS135 (San Diego), ENSS129
     (Champaign), and ENSS132 (Pittsburgh), there have been only two
     operational problems.  One involved an instance of backlevel
     microcode following a software update, and the other involved a
     failure of the original hardware installed.  The experience with
     RS960 FDDI has been extremely positive so far.

     There are performance tests under way involving Pittsburgh
     Supercomputer Center, San Diego Supercomputer Center, and National



Cooper                                                         [Page 35]

Internet Monthly Report                                    November 1992


     Center for Supercomputer Applications that are designed to exploit
     the FDDI high bandwidth capability.  Following the completion of
     these tests, additional RS960 FDDI adapters will be deployed.

     All production network interfaces are still configured for a 1500
     byte Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU).  We will soon reconfigure the
     MTU on most network interfaces to maximize performance for
     applications designed to exploit T3/FDDI bandwidth, while
     maintaining satisfactory performance for sites that interconnect to
     the T3 routers via an ethernet- only interface.  The new
     configuration will be:

     o Any ENSS with an RS960 FDDI interface will have a 4000 byte MTU
       except for the ethernet interfaces which will remain at 1500
       bytes. The FDDI interface MTU will be set to 4352 bytes following
       the deployment of AIX 3.2.

     o All other ENSS ethernet interfaces will have a 1500 byte MTU

     o All T3 CNSS interfaces will have a 4000 byte MTU except T3
       interfaces connecting to an ENSS with ethernet only, and
       interfaces connecting to a T1 CNSS.

     o All T1 CNSS interfaces and T1 ENSS interfaces will have a
       1500 byte MTU.

     Dismantling the T1 Backbone
     ===========================

     Plans to dismantle the T1 backbone have proceeded on schedule.  We
     will begin dismantling the T1 backbone in November '92.  This will
     occur as soon as (1) the remaining networks using the T1 backbone
     are cut over to the T3 backbone (EASInet and CA*net); (2) the OSI
     CLNP encapsulation support for the T3 backbone is deployed; (3) the
     T3 ENSS nodes are backed up by additional T1 circuits terminating
     at alternate backbone POPs. These activities are described below.

     T1 Routing Announcement Change
     ------------------------------

     In early November a change will be made to eliminate the redundant
     announcements of networks from the T3 to the T1 backbone via the
     interconnect, for those networks which are announced to both
     backbones.  This has the effect of eliminating the use of the T1/T3
     interconnect gateway for CA*Net and EASInet in the case of
     isolation of a multi-homed regional from the T1 backbone. This
     change is necessary for the interim to allow these duplicate routes
     to be removed from the overloaded routing tables on the T1 RCP



Cooper                                                         [Page 36]

Internet Monthly Report                                    November 1992


     nodes, and to allow the T1 backbone to be used for a few more
     weeks.

     Remaining Network Cutovers to T3
     --------------------------------

     A new T1 ENSS will be installed in CERN, Switzerland to provide
     connectivity to the T3 backbone for EASInet.  Cutover of EASInet
     traffic will occur when this installation is complete.

     The Seattle RT E-PSP for CA*net is being converted to run the
     CA*net software and operate as part of CA*net's domain. It will run
     GATED and speak BGP with the T3 ENSS. Once this has been debugged
     and tested the Princeton and Ithaca connections will similarly be
     upgraded.

     OSI Support Plan
     ----------------

     We have successfully tested the RT/PC OSI encapsulator software
     (EON) that was described in the August '92 engineering report.
     Because the encapsulator software uses IP to route encapsulated OSI
     traffic, this can be tested over the production T1 network.
     Encapsulation is enabled in one way mode from NSS17 in Ann Arbor to
     selected NSAP prefixes (i.e. encapsulation outgoing, native CLNP
     incoming).  The half duplex capability is important for testing and
     deployment.  When any of the T1 NSFNET EPSP nodes receive an
     encapsulated OSI packet, it decodes it and proceeds to switch it
     via native CLNP.  The OSI encapsulator EPSP is configured on a per
     prefix basis (e.g. any prefix configured to use EON at a given NSS
     will have its outgoing packets encapsulated).

     This flexibility in configuration will allow us to switch two
     regional networks over to OSI encapsulation during the 2nd week of
     November, with full conversion to OSI encapsulation during the 3rd
     week of November.

     Native CLNP switching services will be available in an upcoming
     release of the RS/6000 AIX 3.2 system software which is scheduled
     for deployment on the T3 network in early 1993.

     T3 ENSS Backup Plan
     -------------------

     The plan to provide backup connectivity to T3 ENSS nodes proceeded
     on schedule in October.  We have begun to install dedicated T1
     leased line circuits between all T3 ENSS nodes, and a CNSS T1
     router in a secondary POP.  These T1 circuits are replacing T1
     router ports that were formerly used by T1 safetynet circuits on
     the T1 CNSS routers.  This work is expected to be complete by the
     end of November.  The planned topology for T3 ENSS backup is
     illustrated in a postscript map that is available via anonymous FTP
     on ftp.ans.net in the file </pub/info/t3enss-backup.ps>.  Once the
     backup infrastructure is in place, we will begin to work on
     subsequent optimizations to further improve backup connectivity.
     We have already begun discussions with several regional networks on
     this.

     Several regionals have indicated that they will stop peering with
     the T1 backbone when their T1 ENSS backup circuit is in place.  The
     final phaseout of the T1 backbone will occur after OSI
     encapsulation, final traffic cutovers, and these backup circuits
     are installed.

     Network Source/Destination Statistics Collection
     ================================================

     During October we tested and deployed software on the T3 backbone
     to collect network source/destination traffic statistics.  This is
     a feature that has been supported on the T1 backbone in the past,
     and was supported for a brief period on the T3 backbone prior to
     the migration to RS960 switching technology.

     For each ENSS local area network interface, we will collect the
     following information for each source/destination network pair:
     packets (in and out), bytes (in and out), packets distributed by
     port#, packets distributed by protocol type (UDP, TCP).  Packets
     are sampled on the card (1 in 50 packets sampled) and forwarded to
     the system processor for reduction and storage.  We expect to have
     collected a full month of network source/destination statistics by
     the end of November.

     Notable Outages in October
     ==========================

     MCI Fiber Outage - 10/17
     ------------------------

     At 12:33EST on 10/17 we experienced a major MCI fiber outage on the



Cooper                                                         [Page 38]

Internet Monthly Report                                    November 1992


     east coast.  A truck accident damaged a fiber-line between Trenton
     and New Brunswick (New Jersey).  This caused an extended loss of
     connectivity for several T3 and T1 circuits that transited the MCI
     junction in West Orange New Jersey.  All circuits affected by the
     fiber cut were back on their original path as of 10/17/92 22:00
     EDT.  During the outage, several circuits were moved to backup
     restoration facilities and were moved back during the early morning
     of 10/18.  There were some periods of routing instability with
     circuits going down and coming back up that caused temporary loss
     of connectivity for other network sites as well.

     Routing Software Instabilities - 10/19, 10/23
     ---------------------------------------------

     During the week of October 19th, the T3 network experienced 3
     unscheduled outages (roughly 1 hour each in duration).  We
     successfully installed a new version of rcp_routed software on all
     T3 backbone nodes that fixed the problem on 10/25. This bug
     involved the interface between the routing daemon, and the SNMP
     subagent.  With the addition of the 86th AS peer on the T3
     backbone, the buffer between the routing daemon and the SNMP
     subagent would get corrupted and induce a crash of the routing
     software.

     This problem occurred first during the cutover of the ESnet peers
     at FIX-E, and FIX-W on 10/19.  Following the resolution of this
     problem, the ESnet peers were successfully cutover to use the T3
     backbone.

     NOVEMBER 1992

     Network Status Summary
     ======================

     All remaining T1 backbone traffic was cutover to the T3 backbone
     and the T1 backbone network was turned off on December 2nd.

     There were network stability problems observed at several sites
     prior to, and during the IETF MBONE video/audio multicast event in
     November.  The problems were mostly due to increased traffic, and
     the inefficient processing of source route packets that caused
     routing instabilities.

Internet Monthly Report                                    November 1992


     Software changes have been deployed on the T3 backbone to reduce
     the routing instability problems due the MBONE, and to improve the
     efficiency for downloading large routing updates to the packet
     forwarding interfaces on the T3 routers.

     New RS960 FDDI interfaces are being scheduled for deployment to
     selected T3 ENSS nodes in December.  Performance measurements over
     the T3 network are proceeding at sites that already have FDDI
     interfaces installed.

     Backbone Traffic and Routing Statistics
     =======================================

     The total inbound packet count for the T1 network was
     3,589,916,970, down 14.8% from October.  598,015,432 of these
     packets entered from the T3 network.

     The total inbound packet count for the T3 network was
     20,968,465,293, up 10.7% from October.  134,269,388 of these
     packets entered from the T1 network.

     The combined total inbound packet count for the T1 and T3 networks
     (less cross network traffic) was 23,826,097,443 up 5.9% from
     October.

     As of November 30, the number of networks configured in the NSFNET
     Policy Routing Database was 7833 for the T1 backbone, and 7581 for
     the T3 backbone. Of these, 1642 networks were never announced to
     the T1 backbone and 1602 were never announced to the T3 backbone.
     For the T1, the maximum number of networks announced to the
     backbone during the month (from samples collected every 15 minutes)
     was 5772; on the T3 the maximum number of announced networks was
     5548.  Average announced networks on 11/30 were 5707 to T1, and
     5495 to T3.

     T1 NSFNET Backbone Turned Off
     =============================

     The activities required to turn off the T1 backbone were completed
     during November and the network was officially turned off by
     disabling routing on the NSS nodes starting at 00:01 EST on 12/2.
     Several actions were taken in advance of the routing shutdown
     including installation of the T1 ENSS206 at CERN in Switzerland,
     reconfiguration of the T1 NSS routers to gateway traffic between
     CA*net and NSFNET, the deployment of the EON software for OSI
     encapsulation over IP, and the final installation of T1 backup
     circuit infrastructure connecting T3 ENSS nodes to secondary CNSS
     nodes.

     Remaining Network Cutovers to T3
     --------------------------------

     AS 68, Los Alamos National Laboratory networks and AS22, operated
     by MilNet at the San Diego Supercomputer Center were cutover to use
     the T3 backbone in November.

     A new T1 ENSS (ENSS206) was installed in CERN, Switzerland to
     provide connectivity to the T3 backbone for EASInet.  ENSS206 is
     interconnected via a T1 circuit with CNSS35 in New York City.  The
     ENSS was initially configured with less than the recommended
     memory, and had to be upgraded to overcome some performance
     problems.  Other than that, the installation went smoothly, and
     EASInet traffic was cutover to the T3 backbone on 12/1.

     The NSS nodes in Seattle, Ithaca and Princeton were converted for
     use by CA*net to allow CA*net to peer with the T3 network until the
     longer term GATED hardware peer configurations are available.  The
     E-PSP nodes for CA*net will be converted to run the CA*net software
     and operate as part of CA*net's domain.  These nodes will run GATED
     and exchange routes via BGP with the T3 ENSS.

     OSI Support on T3 Backbone
     --------------------------

     OSI CLNP forwarding over the T3 backbone was configured via
     encapsulation of CLNP over IP packets using the EON method
     (RFC1070) until native CLNP switching services are available on the
     T3 routers.  RT PSP routers were configured as EON encapsulators at
     most regional and peer networks. CLNP traffic on the regional is
     first routed to the EON machine. The EON machine encapsulates the
     CLNP packet in an IP packet. The EON machine will send the IP
     packet to the remote EON machine that is associated with the
     destination NSAP address prefix in the CLNP packet. The IP packet
     generated by EON will contain the source address of the EON
     machine, and the destination address of the EON machine.  The
     following static mapping tables will exist in the EON machines:

     NSAP Prefix ->  remote IP address of EON machine to decapsulate
                     the IP packet into a CLNP packet.

     For local NETs of Router:

     NSAP Prefix ->  local NET of router on the ethernet to route
                     the traffic off the NSFNET service

     Changes or requests to be added to these tables should be sent to
     nsfnet-admin@merit.edu.

     The support for CLNP native switching services on the T3 backbone
     proceeded to be tested in November.  The AIX 3.2 system software
     that supports CLNP switching is in system test and is expected to
     be available on the T3 backbone in February '93.

     T3 ENSS Backup Plan
     -------------------

     The installation and testing of dedicated T1 leased line circuits
     between all T3 ENSS nodes, and a CNSS T1 router in a secondary POP
     was completed in November. The topology for T3 ENSS backup is
     illustrated in a postscript map that is available via anonymous FTP
     on ftp.ans.net in the file </pub/info/t3enss-backup.ps>.  We have
     begun to work on subsequent optimizations to further improve backup
     connectivity.  There may be situations where a secondary ENSS
     router is used to terminate T1 backup circuits.

     T1 Backbone Turned Off
     ----------------------

     These activities required to precede the T1 backbone were concluded
     on 12/1 and the shutdown of the T1 backbone commenced on 12/2.
     There were a couple of problems that were quickly corrected during
     the T1 backbone shutdown.  Some regionals that maintained default
     routing configurations pointing to the T1 backbone lost
     connectivity for a brief period.  Some regional router
     configurations were changed, and the T3 backbone will continue to
     announce the T1 backbone address (129.140) from several ENSS nodes
     for a while longer to ease the transition.

     Also, there was a problem discovered with the RCP nodes in the
     "NSS-router" configuration used for the CA*Net interconnection to
     the T3 network.  The RCPs could not manage the full 6000+ network
     destination routing tables. As a workaround, the three NSS-routers
     are now configured to advertise the T3 backbone network as a
     default route to CA*Net.

     ANSNET/NSFNET Operational Experiences with MBONE
     ================================================

     During the week of 11/9 and 11/16, there were a number of
     operational problems during the preparation and actual operation of
     the IETF MBONE packet video/audiocast.  The use of loose source
     route packets, and the large volume of MBONE traffic appears to
     have caused fairly widespread problems for several Internet service
     providers.  However, the volume of MBONE traffic and source route
     optioned packets did not seem to adversely affect the
     ANSNET/NSFNET, as was earlier believed.  There were severe routing



Cooper                                                         [Page 42]

Internet Monthly Report                                    November 1992


     instabilities with peer networks at several ANSNET/NSFNET border
     gateways including E128 (Palo Alto), E144 (FIX-E), E145 (FIX-W) and
     most notably at E133 (Ithaca) due to the MBONE traffic and
     processing of source route packets.  The instability in these peer
     networks coupled with inefficient handling of very large and
     frequent routing changes introduced through EGP resulted in some
     ANSNET/NSFNET instabilities.  Networks carrying MBONE traffic
     frequently stopped being advertised by external peers, and were
     timed out by the ENSS.  The external peer then stabilized and these
     networks were then advertised to the ENSS by the external peer soon
     thereafter.  This process repeated itself in a cyclical fashion.

     This caused a few connectivity problems at various places on the
     ANSNET, but was by far the worst at ENSS133 (Ithaca).  One reason
     that the problem was worse at ENSS133 than at other places was due
     to the fact that Cornell was on the sending end of a fair number of
     MBONE tunnels, which meant the card-to-system traffic for
     unreachable destinations tended to be higher on the ENSS133 router
     than elsewhere.  There were several actions taken during the week
     of 11/16 (IETF video/audiocast) which reduced the severity of this
     problem including:

     (a)  ICMP unreachable messages were turned off on the external
          interfaces of ENSS routers that experienced problems. These
          messages were not being processed directly on the external
          ENSS interfaces which resulted in some inefficiency.  New
          software will be deployed in early December to correct this.

     (b)  SprintLink rerouted traffic (and the MBONE tunnel) from the
          IETF to Cornell from the CIX (via internal PSInet path), to
          the T3 ANSNET path.  This improved stability within PSInet
          and within ANSNET.

     (c)  Cornell rerouted traffic (MBONE tunnel) to SDSC from the
          PSInet path to the T3 ANSNET path.

     (d)  One of the two parallel IETF audio/video channels was
          disabled.

     (e)  A default route was established on ENSS133 pointing to its
          adjacent internal router (CNSS49).  This ensured that
          card<->system traffic being processed due to unreachable
          destinations was moved to the CNSS router which was not
          involved in processing EGP updates.

     (f)  A new version of the routing software was installed on the
          four ENSS nodes that experienced route flapping to aggregate
          EGP updates from external peers before sending IBGP messages



Cooper                                                         [Page 43]

Internet Monthly Report                                    November 1992


          to other internal T3 routers.

     The combination of all of these actions stabilized ENSS133 and the
     other ENSS routers that experienced instabilities. There are
     several actions which we already have, or will soon implement to
     avoid ANSNET border router instabilities during future MBONE
     multicast events:

     (1)  The ENSS EGP software has been enhanced to support improved
          aggregation of updates from external peers into IBGP update
          messages.  The ENSS will now aggregate EGP derived routes
          together into a single update before flooding this to
          other routers across the backbone via IBGP.  This improves
          the efficiency of the ENSS dramatically.

     (2)  A change to the ANSNET router interface microcode has been
          implemented (and will be deployed during early December)
          so that problems resulting from large amounts of ENSS
          card-system traffic will be eliminated when destinations
          become unreachable.  Even if mrouted keeps sending traffic,
          this will be dropped on the incoming ENSS interface.

     (3)  The T1 NSFNET backbone was disconnected on 12/2.  The T1
          network (particularly the interconnect points with the
          T3 system) was a major source of route flapping, and
          eliminating it should provide an additional margin for
          handling instability from other peer networks.

     While the changes we are making to the T3 network will
     significantly improve T3 network performance in dealing with
     external EGP peer flapping, and related MBONE routing problems, our
     changes will *NOT* improve the problems that other Internet
     networks may experience when processing source route packets, and
     handling routing transitions with MBONE tunnels.

     We recommend that each service provider develop their own internal
     routing plan to address this, we continue to recommend the
     migration to use of BGP at all border gateways, and we recommend
     that MBONE software be upgraded to support IP encapsulation to
     avoid the problems with routers that do not process loose source
     route optioned packets efficiently.  We also are recommending that
     the MBONE developers explore optimizing the mrouted software to
     avoid the sustained unidirectional flows to unreachable
     destinations that we observed.  Finally, it is recommended that an
     mrouted machine be maintained on the ENSS DMZ of each participating
     regional, and this node be used as a hierarchical distribution
     point to locations in the local campus and regional.  Backhauling
     of traffic across campuses and regionals should be discouraged.

     Routing Software on the T3 Network
     ==================================

     New routing software was installed on the T3 backbone in November
     to support various enhancements.  There is improved route download
     performance using asynchronous IOCTL calls.  There is new support
     for static routes, and checks for the size of BGP updates and
     attributes.

     New software will be installed in early December that addresses the
     routing instability problems observed during the MBONE multicast
     events in November.  This will include the code for improved
     aggregation of EGP updates thereby eliminating any CPU starvation
     during EGP route flapping.

     Next AIX 3.1 System Software Release
     ====================================

     New RS6000 system software was deployed on several T3 network nodes
     in late November and will be fully deployed by early December.  The
     most significant change is the ability to drop packets on the
     interface which receives them for which there is no route
     available.  During transient routing conditions we may experience
     high card/system traffic due to route downloads which can cause
     transient instabilities.  This change will improve the efficiency
     for route installs/deletes between router system memory and the
     on-card forwarding tables.  This code also supports the generation
     of ICMP network unreachable messages on the card rather than on the
     system.  There are two bug fixes in this software, one for the
     performance problem that can occur when an IBGP TCP session gets
     deadlocked, and another that avoids FDDI problems if a T1 backup
     link on a T3 ENSS gets congested.  Also all ENSS interfaces now
     support MTU path discovery.

     RS960 FDDI Deployment Status
     ============================

     We are proceeding to schedule RS960 FDDI adapter installations on
     several ENSS nodes in December including ENSS134 (NEARnet), ENSS130
     (Argonne), ENSS145 (FIX-E), ENSS136 (SURAnet), ENSS139 (SESQUInet),
     ENSS144 (FIX-W), ENSS142 (WestNet), and ENSS143 (NorthWestNet).

     There are performance tests under way involving Pittsburgh
     Supercomputer Center, San Diego Supercomputer Center, and National
     Center for Supercomputer Applications that are designed to exploit
     the FDDI high bandwidth capability. The MTUs on various interfaces
     in the T3 backbone have been changed as was described in the
     October engineering report, and the ENSS nodes will negotiate MTU

     path discovery with other systems outside the T3 backbone.  During
     the tests performed so far, there have been some observations of
     low level packet loss (1.6%) between the Cray end systems at the
     supercomputer centers which has caused performance problems with
     the large window TCP implementations achieving peak performance
     over the T3 backbone.  The packet loss problems have not been
     traced to sources inside the T3 backbone, and the problem is being
     investigated by the supercomputer centers.

     Network Source/Destination Statistics Collection
     ================================================

     During November, we collected the first full month of T3 network
     source/destination traffic statistics.  This data will be used for
     topology engineering, capacity planning, and various research
     projects.

     RS960 Memory Parity Problem
     ===========================

     During November, we experienced two problems on CNSS17 and CNSS65
     due to the failure of parity checking logic within the on-card
     memory on selected RS960 T3 adapters.  These outages are very
     infrequent and do not generally result in ENSS isolation from the
     network since only a single interface will be affected, and
     redundant connectivity is employed on other CNSS interfaces.  The
     problems were cleared by a software reset of the interface.  The
     problem is suspected to be due to the memory technology used on
     some of the cards.

     SDSC Network Activities
     =======================

     The major activity for the month was the splitting of our main
     building Ethernet into multiple segments and the resulting need to
     reconfigure every device in the building to handle their new
     address and subnet mask.  This was done over the weekend of 20-22
     Nov.  The ripples took several more days to damp out.  All this
     planned to happen when we placed our new Auspex file server into
     production use.

     Our next Flag day will be during the end of year hoildays when we
     plan to convert our DMZ from a subnet of 132.249 to a Class C.

     SDSC Applied Network Research Group
     ===================================

     Study of Routing Fluctuations

     Bilal Chinoy completed a study of routing fluctuations as seen by
     the NSFNET backbone and quantified the changes in terms of the
     number of networks changing state, time intervals between state
     changes, average number of transitions per network, etc.  The
     results should be available soon in the form of a technical paper.

     Packet Video

     We received a test version of the IBM person-to person packet video
     conferencing system from IBM.  We plan to study the system and
     characterize it's end-to-end performance when used across the
     Internet.  Initial cross-country experiments have started at this
     point of time.

     Backbone Traffic Characterization

     As a followup to our May 1992 study of the T1 NSFNET backbone, this
     month we have begun to investigate the packet characterization
     statistics for the T3 backbone, with help from Merit and ANS.  The
     recent deployment of statistics collection functionality in the T3
     routers, and the helpful cooperation of the developers of that
     software (at Merit and ANS) are facilitating our study.

     1. We now have 3 GPT Codecs cponnected via HSI/S boards to suns,
     and are able to capture video from them at 192kbps and exchange it
     over TCP and UDP (multicast). We are working on inter-working tests
     between these, some BT Codecs and the Inria IVS H.261 software.
     This entails stripping out the H.221 framing (one of the more
     stupid protocols in existence), and enhancing IVS to discard or use
     motion vectors.

     We are currently using a delay adaptation scheme for receiving
     H.261 over TCP connections that operates rather lkike the Vat audio
     one.  This seems to work ok, so long as TCP does not apply the
     congesiton avoidance window after loss. The receiver specifies a
     tolerable delay, and if this exceeds one RTT by more than a RTT
     variance, we can tolerate retransmits. If not, we just adapt to
     delay variation.

     2. The MICE project (prematurely announced last month) is now
     officially underway.

     3. The SuperJANET project now has a contracted supplier (BT, as has
     been announced in the press). Initially, they will provide up to 45
     sites with 34 Mbps SMDS access as well as 6 (increasing to 12)
     sites with 140 Mbps PHDH access for pilot ATM and higher speed
     network research.  This will transition to SDH throughout, with an
     ATM overlay.

     Initial pilot projects will be up by March 1993, ranging from
     applications (viscous fingering and remote video teaching of
     surgery) to interworking of ATM switches.
