INTERNET MONTHLY REPORTS
------------------------

The purpose of these reports is to communicate to the Internet Research
Group the accomplishments, milestones reached, or problems discovered by
the participating organizations.

Each organization is expected to submit a 1/2 page report on the first
business day of the month describing the previous month's activities.
These reports should be submitted via network mail to "IMR-ED@ISI.EDU".

Details on obtaining the current IMR, or back issues, via FTP or EMAIL
may be obtained by sending an EMAIL message to "rfc-info@ISI.EDU" with
the message body "help: ways_to_get_imrs".  For example:

         To: rfc-info@ISI.EDU

INTERNET ARCHITECTURE BOARD

     The IAB wants to express its appreciation for the value of the IMR
     over many years and for the efforts of its contributors and
     editors. However, we note that the Web is now widely used as an
     information service, and in particular that the IETF, IANA and RFC
     Editor now have very complete Web sites with current information.
     The IAB has therefore concluded that the IMR was consuming valuable
     resources that could be better directed elsewhere.  We thank you
     all for your dedication on this project over many years.

     The minutes of the IAB back to 1990 are available for anonymous ftp
     access on host ftp.isi.edu, directory /pub/IAB, or via the IAB
     World-Wide Web page with URL http://www.iab.org/iab/.

               Internet Monthly Report for December, 1998


  1. The next meeting of the IETF will be held in Minneapolis,
     Minnesota from March 15-19, 1999. This meeting is being hosted by
     Ascend Communications. Registration is scheduled to begin the
     first part of January.

     Following Minneapolis, the IETF meets in Oslo, Norway in July,
     and in Washington, DC in November. Once all arrangements have
     been made, notifications will be sent to the IETF Announcement
     list. Remember that information on future meeting sites can
     always be found in the file 0mtg-sites.txt, located on the IETF
     shadow directories. Of course, this information is provided on
     the Web. The IETF's URL is:

                          http://www.ietf.org/

  2. The minutes of the IESG teleconferences be found on all the IETF
     shadow directories in the /iesg directory.

     The following IESG minutes have been added:

       October 8, 1998 (iesg.98-10-08)
       October 22, 1998 (iesg.98-10-22)

     THE US DOMAIN
     =============

     The US Domain registration information is available online at
     http://www.isi.edu/us-domain.

     Much of the processing of the requests to the third level domain
     name is now automated. In particular, most requests to register
     names in localities already delegated are automatically forwarded
     to the administrator of that locality.

MERIT INTERNET ENGINEERING
--------------------------

     This report summarizes December 1998 Internet engineering
     activities at Merit Network, Inc. (www.merit.edu).

     The MRT (Multi-Threaded Routing Toolkit) project has joined an
     international industry/university consortium led by NEC
     Corporation, the Furukawa Electric Co., and Sumitomo Electric
     Industries.  The new alliance will focus on development and
     dissemination of standards for QoS, integrated multimedia, priority
     routing, and other networking technologies.  Participating
     universities include the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Hokkaido
     University, Kyoto University, Kyushu University, Hiroshima
     University, Hiroshima City University, Teikyo University, and the
     University of Michigan, Merit's host institution.  For more
     information about MRT, see:

             http://www.merit.edu/mrt/

     At the 43rd IETF in Orlando, Sue Hares chaired the Inter-Domain
     Routing Working Group session and was co-leader of the
     Authentication, Accounting, and Authorization (AAA) BOF.  IETF was
     also the site of an informational GateD meeting that included
     technical briefings, status reports, and administrative updates.
     MRT was used to establish the IPv6 terminal connection at the
     Orlando IETF, and at the previous IETF meeting in Chicago.

     Sue Hares has been active in Internet2 activities in support of the
     QBone, an interdomain testbed for differentiated services.  The
     QBone seeks to provide the higher-education community with end-to-
     end services in support of emerging advanced networked applications
     (see http://www.internet2.edu/qos/qbone/). Hares attended the first
     meeting of the I2 QBone Interoperability Group, and also led the
     first meeting of the Internet2 QBone Bandwidth Broker Advisory
     Council.  Bandwidth Broker services make it possible for networks
     and providers to allocate bandwidth for optimum use of Quality of
     Service/differentiated service technologies.

UCL
----

     UCL are now running IPv6 on the CAIRN link and on part of the
     LEARNET network. We are also comparing three different IP QoS/CoS
     queueing schemes - the AltQ, and one from CMU and CBQ - for their
     efficiency in supporting a particular service letvel with a
     particualr utilisation in the CAIRN router environment.

     A collaboration has started with Nortel and Sprint and Sun, on
     seeing if more and possibly simpler IP multicast service  models
     can be accomodated, particualry within an IPv6 addressing
     framework.

     We are working on the implementation details of our watercasting
     scheme (distributed digital watermakring for multicast realtime
     data).

     * New RFCs added to queue throughout the month

     The Requests for Comments (RFCs) are a series of notes, started in
     1969, about the Internet (originally the ARPANET). The notes
     discuss many aspects of computing and computer communication
     focusing in networking protocols, procedures, programs, and
     concepts, but also including meeting notes, opinion, and sometimes
     humor. The specification documents of the Internet protocol suite,
     as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and its
     steering group (the IESG), are published as RFCs.

     RFCs-to-be are edited by the RFC Editor.  RFCs enter the RFC
     Editor's work queue either by an action of the IESG or by
     independent submission.  Most independent submissions are referred
     to the IESG to check for overlap with IETF work.  The IESG might
     put a hold on a document to gather more input from its members.
     The wait for an RFC to be published varies as there can be
     unforeseen complications (typically editorial matters that need
     clarification from the author).  Documents can be removed from the
     publication queue if they are found to be insufficient or incorrect
     or if the IESG asks the author to join work already in progress in
     the IETF.
