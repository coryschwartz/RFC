INTERNET MONTHLY REPORTS
------------------------

The purpose of these reports is to communicate to the Internet Research
Group the accomplishments, milestones reached, or problems discovered by
the participating organizations.

Each organization is expected to submit a 1/2 page report on the first
business day of the month describing the previous month's activities.
These reports should be submitted via network mail to "IMR-ED@ISI.EDU".

The Internet Monthly Report mailing list is now managed by MajorDomo at
ISI.EDU.  The announcements of new issues on the Internet Monthly Report
are sent to the IETF-Announce list and to this IMR list.

Requests to be ADDED or DELETED from the Internet Monthly report list
should be sent to "majordomo@isi.edu" with the message body either
"subscribe imr" or "unsubscribe imr".

Details on obtaining the current IMR, or back issues, via FTP or EMAIL
may be obtained by sending an EMAIL message to "rfc-info@ISI.EDU" with
the message body "help: ways_to_get_imrs".  For example:

     INTERNIC DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES

     For some time, InterNIC Directory and Datbase Services has been
     working with Lucent Technologies to test Nomenclator.  Nomenclator
     was developed by Joann Ordille who is now with Bell Laboratories
     at Lucent.

     Nomenclator knows about a number of different CCSO directories.
     It takes directory queries from users and send them to the CCSO
     servers that are likely to be able to respond to the query.  When
     the responses come back from the CCSO servers, it puts the answers
     in a common format and presents the combined results to the user.

     A version of Nomenclator is now available on our production
     servers.  To try it out, see:

           http://ds.internic.net/nomen/nomen_query_people.html

     For more information about Nomenclator, see:

     THE US DOMAIN REGISTRY

     The US Domain registration form is now available online at
     http://www.isi.edu/us-domain.

     The US Domain has the maps of all the delegated special domains
     online at http://www.isi.edu/us-domain.

     The US Domain administrator no longer makes direct registrations of
     hosts, and only makes delegations of third or fourth level domain
     names (such as localities).

     Some of the processing of the requests to the third level domain
     name is now automated. In particular, most requests to register
     names in localities already delegated are automatically forwarded
     to the administrator of that locality.

     A new policy has been added regarding the charges for the domain
     name passed on during delegation.  The administrator of the
     locality has to notify one year in advance before charging for
     those domains.

MERIT INTERNET ENGINEERING
--------------------------

     This report summarizes May 1997 activities of Merit's Internet
     Engineering group on behalf of the Routing Arbiter (RA) service and
     other projects.






IMR Editor                                                     [Page 15]

Internet Monthly Report                                         May 1997


     RTConfig, a tool developed by the Routing Arbiter project as part
     of the RAToolSet, is being used by many network operators to
     generate backbone router configurations (see the USC Information
     Sciences Institute Web page, http://www.isi.edu/ra/RAToolSet/).
     RTConfig users can now gain a significant speed advantage by using
     Trawhoisd instead of RAWhoisd as their Internet Routing Registry
     query server. Trawhoisd (Trivial rawhoisd), a powerful, distributed
     version of RAWhoisd, makes it possible to cache any or all of the
     databases in the IRR on local workstations, giving users complete,
     local administrative control of their own registry.  The
     streamlined Trawhoisd code is easy to install and run, and has been
     ported to Digital Unix, SunOS, and Solaris.  Users can select a
     subset of the registries to be locally cached--only AS objects,
     Route objects, or Maintainer objects, for example.  This kind of
     flexibility brings considerable savings in cache storage
     requirements--a major concern for users maintaining their own
     copies of the IRR.

     Trawhoisd supports data caching in two ways:  by FTP and by
     mirroring.  The database mirroring mechanism was implemented by
     David Kessens of the RIPE NCC/ISI. When cached data is mirrored,
     users can choose to update the cache every few minutes, providing
     near real-time accuracy for the data.  The RIPE NCC currently
     supports mirroring, and Merit will soon support its own database
     mirroring site.  This will mean that other IRR organizations can
     update their database copies with new RADB data as frequently as
     every five minutes, rather than every 24 hours.

     Trawhoisd serves compute-intensive users, whose needs have not been
     well served in the past because of RAWhoisd's performance problems.
     Testing has shown Trawhoisd to be nearly two orders of magnitude
     faster than RAWhoisd.  This performance speedup is realized by
     avoiding network delays, and by the fact that Trawhoisd is written
     is C rather than Perl, in which RAWhoisd is implemented (the
     database management scheme used in Perl is extremely slow).

     Primary Trawhoisd development was performed at Merit by Gerald
     Winters and Xin Liu.  A beta version is available from:

            ftp://ftp.ra.net/routing.arbiter/tools/trabeta.tar.gz

     Trawhoisd requires perl5.003.  The current, centralized RAWhoisd
     server remains available, with the ability to answer router
     configuration queries and support whois-type browsing of the IRR.

     Merit welcomes comments, bug reports, and questions about the new
     code.  Please direct e-mail to db-admin@ra.net.

     Jerry Winters and Bill Norton attended the 27th RIPE meeting in
     Dublin.  Winters gave a presentation titled "Merging RAWhoisd and
     the RIPE Whois Server" at the Database Working Group, and both
     participated in sessions of the Routing Working Group.

     The Merit GateD Consortium hosted a two-day technical training
     session in Ann Arbor, and consortium leader Sue Hares presented a
     two-day GateD overview for Newbridge Networks staff in Herndon, VA.
     Several other Merit staff members took advantage of training
     opportunities this month, as Abha Ahuja attended a course titled
     "Advanced Cisco Router Configuration," sponsored by the American
     Research Group, and Susan R. Harris attended a NetWorld+Interop 97

     The CAIRN link is operational, and we now have administrative
     scoped multicast from UCL to the US _ we have participated in 2
     drop-in meetings so far, succesfully.

     A bulk transfer Reliable Multicast protocol has been designed,
     implemented, tested and simulated, and is written up in a HIPPARCH
     paper - see ftp://cs.ucl.ac.uk/darpa/h.ps for a draft.

     * New RFCs added to queue throughout the month

     The Requests for Comments (RFCs) are a series of notes, started in
     1969, about the Internet (originally the ARPANET). The notes
     discuss many aspects of computing and computer communication
     focusing in networking protocols, procedures, programs, and
     concepts, but also including meeting notes, opinion, and sometimes
     humor. The specification documents of the Internet protocol suite,
     as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and its
     steering group (the IESG), are published as RFCs.

     RFCs-to-be are edited by the RFC Editor.  RFCs enter the RFC
     Editor's work queue either by an action of the IESG or by
     independent submission.  Most independent submissions are referred
     to the IESG to check for overlap with IETF work.  The IESG might
     put a hold on a document to gather more input from its members.
     The wait for an RFC to be published varies as there can be
     unforeseen complications (typically editorial matters that need
     clarification from the author).  Documents can be removed from the
     publication queue if they are found to be insufficient or incorrect
     or if the IESG asks the author to join work already in progress in
     the IETF.
