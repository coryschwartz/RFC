INTERNET MONTHLY REPORTS
------------------------

The purpose of these reports is to communicate to the Internet Research
Group the accomplishments, milestones reached, or problems discovered by
the participating organizations.

Each organization is expected to submit a 1/2 page report on the first
business day of the month describing the previous month's activities.
These reports should be submitted via network mail to "IMR-ED@ISI.EDU".

`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

The Internet Monthly Report mailing list is now managed by MajorDomo at
ISI.EDU.  The announcements of new issues on the Internet Monthly Report
are sent to the IETF-Announce list and to this IMR list.

Requests to be ADDED or DELETED from the Internet Monthly report list
should be sent to "majordomo@isi.edu" with the message body either
"subscribe imr" or "unsubscribe imr".

Details on obtaining the current IMR, or back issues, via FTP or EMAIL
may be obtained by sending an EMAIL message to "rfc-info@ISI.EDU" with
the message body "help: ways_to_get_imrs".  For example:

        To: rfc-info@ISI.EDU

     Some of the processing of the requests to the third level domain

     to the administrator of that locality.

     Recent announcements:

     1. A new policy has been added to avoid several cases of
     misleading, erroneous, and outright false information provided on
     registration applications.

     One situation that occurs is that one individual represents himself
     as several distinct companies in order to bypass some limitations
     on the number of delegations allowed (e.g., the 50/500 rule).

     Another situation is that with the requirement to provide a
     government employee as the administrative contact for a locality
     delegation.  Some applications have been received with a government
     employee's contact information but that person has no idea that
     such an application has been submitted.  Some applications provide
     contact information for an individual that knows what is going on
     but is not an employee of the locality government.  Still other
     applications have been received where the administrative contact
     information is fictional.

     The US Domain Administration may choose to verify any or all of the
     information on registration applications (including the
     administrative contact) and if it is determined that the an
     application contains false of substantially misleading information
     that application may be denied, or if already acted on the
     delegation may be revoked, and in either case all other delegations
     made to the party submitting the false or misleading application
     may also be revoked.

     2. A total of about 2000 locality domains that were delegated to
     several domain name managers have been returned to the US Domain
     administrator.  These localities will be made available for
     redelegation in the coming months.

     3. For delegations made after 1-Jul-97, it is assumed by the US
     Domain Administrator that every applicant for the delegation (or
     redelegation) of a locality name has the written agreement of the
     legitimate government for that locality for the applicant to manage
     the domain name of that locality.

     Evidence of such an agreement does not need to be presented at the
     time of delegation (except that the administrative contact on the
     application template must be the government representative).



Ramos                                                          [Page 16]

Internet Monthly Report                                    December 1997


     However, if the delegation is later challenged or contested, the
     manager of the locality domain must produce the agreement.  Failure
     to do so will most likely result in the transfer of the management
     of the locality domain to another manager that does have such an
     agreement.

     If there is a dispute as to what is the legitimate government for a
     locality is and who may act for it, the league of cities or
     association of municipalities that each state (as recognized by the
     National League of Cities) may be asked to assist in resolving such
     disputes.

     In some places there are overlapping jurisdictions with the same
     name (for example, the city of Los Angeles and the county of Los
     Angeles).  In such cases, the higher level government should have
     priority.  A new policy has been added regarding the charges for
     the domain name passed on during delegation.  The administrator of
     the locality has to notify one year in advance before charging for
     those domains.

     4. The US Domain administrator no longer makes direct registrations
     of hosts, and only makes delegations of third or fourth level
     domain names (such as localities).

MERIT INTERNET ENGINEERING
--------------------------

     This report summarizes December 1997 activities of Merit's Internet
     Engineering group on behalf of the Routing Arbiter (RA) service and
     other projects.

     The Route Server Next Generation project (http://www.rsng.net/) has
     proposed a new mechanism for using Internet Routing Registry (IRR)
     Agreements (MLPAs) at the exchange points. MLPAs never gained wide
     acceptance at the IXPs.  The agreements can be somewhat cumbersome




Ramos                                                          [Page 19]

Internet Monthly Report                                    December 1997


     to maintain:  even in cases where each organization at the exchange
     agrees to peer with all the others, each peer has to modify the
     routing policy in its aut-num object by hand in order to establish
     peering with new organizations as they join the IXP.

     Jake Khuon has proposed the use of a single as-macro object that
     would dynamically configure routing policy for all organizations at
     the exchange point.  The as-macro object would be referenced by
     each organization's aut-num object.  Each time a new organization
     joined the exchange, it would simply modify the macro object,
     automatically updating the 'as-in' and 'as-out' policy for all
     other organizations at the exchange.  The new procedure would
     greatly simplify the process of reconfiguring policy to accommodate
     new peers.

     Previously, such an approach could not be implemented because of
     security controls inherent in the Internet Routing Registry:  all
     objects in the IRR can either be modified only by their authorized
     maintainers, or by anyone.  Neither technique is practical for an
     IXP; ideally, each organization would be able to view all routing
     policies in the as-object, but would only be able to modify its own
     information.  In Khuon's new model, a secure, automated e-mail
     gateway gives authorized users (i.e., all peering organizations at
     the IXP) secure access to their own - and only their own - routing
     information in the macro object.

     The proposal is introduced in two drafts: "Specifying and
     Supporting a Layer-3 MLPA Using as-macros," for use with RIPE-181,
     and "Specifying and Supporting a Layer-3 MLPA Using as-sets," for
     RPSL.  The documents are available on the RSng Web pages:

                         http://www.rsng.net/papers/

     The schema was first presented at a December MREN (Metropolitan
     Research and Education Network) meeting in Chicago, and has been
     well received by the community.

     New documentation is available for the 1.4.2 snapshot release of
     MRT, the Multi-Threaded Routing Toolkit.  The publications include
     a revised User/Configuration Guide and Programmer's Guide, and a
     new Installation Guide.  See:

             http://www.merit.edu/net-research/mrt/html/mrt_doc/

     MRT uses novel approaches to routing architecture design, and
     incorporates features such as parallelized light-weight processes,
     multiple processor support, and shared memory.  The object-
     oriented, modular design of the software encourages the rapid



Ramos                                                          [Page 20]

     addition and prototyping of experimental routing protocol and
     inter-domain policy algorithms.

     You can use MRT to:

     -Serve as the backbone routing software for your IPv6 or IPv4
     network connection.

     -Simultaneously handle tasks such as routing policy communication,
     routing policy calculation, and maintenance of a RIB, and
     distribute these tasks over multiple processors or multiple
     machines

     -Generate and analyze route flap statistics

     -Generate real-time graphical maps of Internet routing

     -Capture a BGP peering session and monitor it in real time

     -Record and replay sequences of events, such as routing failures.

     The toolkit comprises two main categories of tools:  Routing and
     Network Performance measurement tools.  The MRT applications
     include:

ROUTING TOOLS
-------------

     -MRTd - A routing daemon supporting RIPng, BGP4+, multiple RIBs
     (route server), and RIP1/2.  MRTd reads Cisco Systems-like router
     configuration files and supports a Cisco Systems router-like telnet
     interface.

     -BGPsim - A BGP4+ traffic generator/simulator

     -SBGP - A simple BGP4+ speaker and listener

     -Route_BtoA - Converts binary MRT messages to ASCII

     -Route_AtoB - Converts ASCII descriptions of MRT messages to
     binary.

NETWORK PERFORMANCE/STATISTICS TOOLS
------------------------------------

     -NetNowd - Measures network performance (one-way latency/loss,
     ICMP, topology/traceroute and bulk file transfer metrics)




Ramos                                                          [Page 21]

Internet Monthly Report                                    December 1997


     -IRRd - An Internet Routing Registry database daemon. Supports
     RIPE-181 and RPSL routing database objects.

     -SalServerd-A "webcasting" server supplying Internet
     statistics/performance channels.

     MRT fans will be glad to hear that the code is now stable, in
     production use on the 6bone, and being used for statistics
     collection at several sites on the Internet.

     At the 40th IETF in Washington, D.C., Sue Hares chaired the Inter-
     Domain Routing Working Group session, and also hosted several GateD
     technical meetings. Abha Ahuja and Jake Khuon attended the December
     MREN (Metropolitan Research and Education Network) meeting in
     Chicago to discuss Route Server issues and Khuon's MLPA proposal.

UCL
----

     We've been testing a version of Vic that uses a semi-reliable
     multicast protocol to do layred congestion avoidance. This is
     running with SAIC and UCL over the CAIRN, and to other sites.  A
     paper describing the protocol was accepted for infocom98
     (ftp://cs.ucl.ac.uk/darpa/infocom98.ps)

     We are also testing the priced/adaptive TCP on the CAIRN (described
     in a paper in submission, at ftp://cs.ucl.ac.uk/darpa/multcp.ps)

     * New RFCs added to queue throughout the month

     The Requests for Comments (RFCs) are a series of notes, started in
     1969, about the Internet (originally the ARPANET). The notes
     discuss many aspects of computing and computer communication
     focusing in networking protocols, procedures, programs, and
     concepts, but also including meeting notes, opinion, and sometimes
     humor. The specification documents of the Internet protocol suite,
     as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and its
     steering group (the IESG), are published as RFCs.

     RFCs-to-be are edited by the RFC Editor.  RFCs enter the RFC
     Editor's work queue either by an action of the IESG or by
     independent submission.  Most independent submissions are referred
     to the IESG to check for overlap with IETF work.  The IESG might
     put a hold on a document to gather more input from its members.
     The wait for an RFC to be published varies as there can be
     unforeseen complications (typically editorial matters that need
     clarification from the author).  Documents can be removed from the
     publication queue if they are found to be insufficient or incorrect
     or if the IESG asks the author to join work already in progress in
     the IETF.
