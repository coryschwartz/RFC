INTERNET ENGINEERING REPORTS
----------------------------

     1. Let me remind everyone that the next IETF meeting will be in
        Dallas, Texas from December 4-8, 1995, with the Newcomers'
        Orientation and Registration Reception being held on Sunday,
        December 3. The Dallas IETF meeting is being hosted by MCI.
        Logistic information will be posted to the IETF Announcement
        list when the Secretariat is begins accepting registrations. The
        IETF meeting fee for the Dallas meeting will be $200.

        Following Dallas, the IETF will be meeting in Los Angeles,
        California from March 4-8, 1996. There will not be a local host
        for this meeting, but the terminal room facilities will be
        provided by Interop. Following Los Angeles, the IETF will be
        meeting in Montreal, Ontario, Canada from June 24-28, 1996. If
        this date looks familiar, that's because this is the same date
        and location as INET '96! Both groups will be meeting in the
        Montreal Convention Center, albeit separately. The one exception
        is the terminal room which will be shared by both INET and IETF
        meeting attendees. The terminal room facilities are being
        provided by INET.

        Once all the arrangements have been made, notifications will be
        sent to the IETF Announcement list. Remember that information
        on future IETF meetings can be always be found in the file
        0mtg-sites.txt which is located on the IETF shadow directories.
        This information can also be viewed from the IETF Home Page on
        the Web. The URL is:

                     http://www.ietf.cnri.reston.va.us


     2. The minutes of the IESG teleconferences have been publicly
        available on the IETF Shadow directories since 1991. These files
        are placed in the /ftp/iesg directory.

INTERNET PROJECTS
-----------------

INTERNIC
--------

     REGISTRATION SERVICES

     I.  Significant Events

     InterNIC Registration Services assigned over 12,619 network
     addresses and registered over 19,657 domains.  There were two (2)
     top-level country domains registered during August: Virgin Islands
     (US), and San Marino (Republic of).

     The suit that Knowledgenet had filed against Network Solutions and
     David L. Boone over the knowledgenet.com domain has been dismissed.
     David Boone has relinquished the domain name to Knowledgenet, Inc.

     During the month of August, domain requests are averaging between
     1,000- 1,500+ for new submissions per day. Adjustments continue to
     be made in domain processing.  Additional, staffing is being
     acquired to accommodate the growth in registration requests. At the
     close of August 1995, the domain processing queue had decreased
     from 15,000+ to 7,000+ new domain registrations.

     II.  Current Status

     During the month of August 1995, InterNIC Registration Services
     received communications as shown below.  The majority of the
     correspondence concerned the assignment and re-assignment of
     network numbers and the registration or change of domain names.

          E-mail     49,286    (hostmaster@internic.net)
          Postal/Fax    248    (primarily IP number requests)
          Phone       7,150

     The Registrations Services host computer supported a large volume
     of information retrieval requests during the month of June.

     INTERNIC DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES

          As a result of a shifting of resources, some of the mailing lists
          handled by Directory and Database Services will be moving to
          Registration Services.  These lists include the Scout Report lists
          maintained by Susan Calcari and the net-happenings lists
          maintained by Gleason Sackman.

          The list maintainers will remain the same, but the "home machines"
          of the lists are moving.  As of the end of August, scout-report
          and scout-report-html have been moved.  The net-happenings lists
          will move in early September.

          Current subscribers of the lists will be moved automatically, but
          new subscriptions and changes to current subscriptions will need
          to be sent to the new machine.

          A reminder - if you would like to help the Internet community find
          a resource that you offer, send mail to admin@ds.internic.net and
          we will send information about listing your resource in the
          Directory of Directories.  If you prefer, you can enter
          information about your resource in our WWW suggestion form.  The
          form can be reached through our Directory of Directories Web page

MERIT/NSFNET ENGINEERING
------------------------

     This report summarizes recent activities of Merit's Internet
     Engineering group on behalf of the Routing Arbiter (RA) Project.

     Jake Khuon and Andy Adams have implemented a new tool that is being
     used to automatically configure the Route Servers at the Sprint and
     AADS NAPs.  Once the tool is fully deployed, Route Server
     configurations at all five interconnection points will be
     automatically refreshed every four hours.

     The RA service is now peering with the vBNS at the Washington, D.C.
     and Sprint NAPs.  More organizations established peering sessions
     with the Route Servers in August:  Advantis, US Cyber, and CAIS
     (Capital Area Internet Service) at the Washington, D.C. NAP, and
     Argonne at the AADS NAP.  A complete list of BGP peering sessions
     is available from:

         http://www.ra.net/routing.arbiter/RA/.bgp.peers.html

     For an overview of services provided by the Route Servers, see:

         http://www.ra.net/routing.arbiter/RA/route.server.html

     The RA project has improved the security procedures available for
     registering in the Routing Arbiter Database.  You can now
     authenticate your submissions with a digital signature using the
     publicly available PGP package.  The staff is working on developing
     key registration procedures.  For more information, send e-mail to
     db-admin@ra.net.

     In cooperation with staff from the CA*net Routing Registry, Merit
     has removed approximately 3,000 duplicate routes from the RADB.

     These routes are now only present in the CA*net registry.  This is
     a continuing effort to eliminate duplicate data from the databases
     that make up the Internet Routing Registry.

     Approximately 4,000 other objects in the Routing Arbiter Database,
     primarily Route objects, were translated from entries in the Policy
     Routing Database and contained no contact information for the
     "owner" of the AS originating the route.  For each of the
     approximately 360 different Autonomous Systems referenced in these
     objects, a Maintainer object needed to be created to provide for
     database consistency and to allow the user community to maintain
     the objects.  Brian Renaud has been working with users to create
     the needed Maintainer objects; 90 have been added to the registry,
     and more are being added every day.

     To begin the process of populating the Maintainers, Steve
     Richardson wrote a program that queried the InterNIC database to
     determine the contacts for each AS and construct a proposed
     Maintainer object.  E-mail was then sent to each contact person
     asking whether they wanted the RADB staff to enter the proposed
     object into the RADB, or specify a different (already existing)
     Maintainer object, or delete the object.  Depending on the
     response, Renaud then worked on a case-by-case basis to create the
     desired objects.  The process involved providing tutorials on the
     RADB and Internet Routing Registry (IRR), explaining and checking
     the syntax of submitted Maintainer objects, making changes to
     referenced Route objects, finding ways to ensure consistency among
     registries in the IRR, and creating reports comparing registrations
     for a particular Autonomous System in the IRR, so that users could
     remove duplicate entries.

     A new Routing Arbiter Database FAQ provides details on registering
     in the RADB, what to do when switching providers, RADB/Internet
     Routing Registry update schedules, and many other topics.  You'll
     find the FAQ at:

     Hardman and others demonstrated the UCL Mbone audio tool which
     features a novel audio encoding which is loss tolerant. This is
     onging work, but will eventually be made publically available with
     other mbone tools being developed at UCL (a shared text editor, our
     version of the session tool, and an email list distribution tool).
