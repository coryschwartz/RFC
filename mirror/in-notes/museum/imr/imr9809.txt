INTERNET MONTHLY REPORTS
------------------------

The purpose of these reports is to communicate to the Internet Research
Group the accomplishments, milestones reached, or problems discovered by
the participating organizations.

Each organization is expected to submit a 1/2 page report on the first
business day of the month describing the previous month's activities.
These reports should be submitted via network mail to "IMR-ED@ISI.EDU".

`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

The Internet Monthly Report mailing list is now managed by MajorDomo at
ISI.EDU.  The announcements of new issues on the Internet Monthly Report
are sent to the IETF-Announce list and to this IMR list.

Requests to be ADDED or DELETED from the Internet Monthly report list
should be sent to "majordomo@isi.edu" with the message body either
"subscribe imr" or "unsubscribe imr".

Details on obtaining the current IMR, or back issues, via FTP or EMAIL
may be obtained by sending an EMAIL message to "rfc-info@ISI.EDU" with
the message body "help: ways_to_get_imrs".  For example:

        To: rfc-info@ISI.EDU
        Subject: getting imrs

     Much of the processing of the requests to the third level domain
     name is now automated. In particular, most requests to register
     names in localities already delegated are automatically forwarded
     to the administrator of that locality.

MERIT INTERNET ENGINEERING
--------------------------

     This report summarizes September 1998 Internet engineering
     activities at Merit Network (www.merit.edu).

     Members of the Route Server Next Generation (www.rsng.net) team
     traveled to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to provide training and
     consulting for the Route Servers at the Emirates Telecom
     Corporation's new exchange point, dubbed ETISALAT.  During the
     previous months, RSng had worked closely with the ETISALAT staff to
     design the exchange point and create a regional routing registry
     for the UAE.  Abha Ahuja, Jake Khuon, and Tom Spindler configured
     the Route Servers at Merit's facilities and shipped them to Dubai;
     while on site, the Merit team completed the installation and worked
     with ETISALAT engineers to ensure the systems were running
     smoothly.  Now that the RSs are in production, they are monitored
     and operated by the ETISALAT engineers themselves.

     Gerald Winters gave three presentations at the 31st RIPE meeting in
     Edinburgh, Scotland.  At the plenary session, he gave a talk titled
     "Post-Routing Arbiter Activities at Merit."  At the Routing Working
     Group, he presented talks on a proposed acceptable use policy for
     the Internet Routing Registry and deployment of the Routing Policy
     Specification Language in the RADB.  Craig Labovitz gave a talk
     titled "Route Flap Analysis" at the ISMA Backbone Engineering Data
     and Analysis conference, sponsored by the Cooperative Association
     for Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA).  Labovitz also attended ACM
     SIGCOMM '98.

     We've been looking at providing protection to multicast data from
     re-multicast - there is a paper about one idea

     Watercasting: Discouraging Disclosure of Multicast Media

     This is a brief paper about a novel idea for providing some level
     of discouragement to deter recipients of a multicast stream from
     re-distributing it to further consumers. There is a relationship
     between the requirements for the scheme proposed here, and the
     requirements for reliable multicast protocols, and the need for
     mechanism to support layered delivery of streamed data.

     see ftp://cs.ucl.ac.uk/darpa/watercast.ps

     Meanwhile, we have also been working on alternate models for IP
     Multicast to the Internet Standard one devised by Steve Deering.
     This will be forthcoming in Internet Drafts for the next IETF, but
     the gist is to abandon the separation of intra and inter-domain
     multicast as a bad idea, and concentrate on scaling multicast
     through simple mechanisms.

     * New RFCs added to queue throughout the month

     The Requests for Comments (RFCs) are a series of notes, started in
     1969, about the Internet (originally the ARPANET). The notes
     discuss many aspects of computing and computer communication
     focusing in networking protocols, procedures, programs, and
     concepts, but also including meeting notes, opinion, and sometimes
     humor. The specification documents of the Internet protocol suite,
     as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and its
     steering group (the IESG), are published as RFCs.

     RFCs-to-be are edited by the RFC Editor.  RFCs enter the RFC
     Editor's work queue either by an action of the IESG or by
     independent submission.  Most independent submissions are referred
     to the IESG to check for overlap with IETF work.  The IESG might
     put a hold on a document to gather more input from its members.
     The wait for an RFC to be published varies as there can be
     unforeseen complications (typically editorial matters that need
     clarification from the author).  Documents can be removed from the
     publication queue if they are found to be insufficient or incorrect
     or if the IESG asks the author to join work already in progress in
     the IETF.
