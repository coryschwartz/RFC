INTERNET MONTHLY REPORTS
------------------------

The purpose of these reports is to communicate to the Internet Research
Group the accomplishments, milestones reached, or problems discovered by
the participating organizations.

Each organization is expected to submit a 1/2 page report on the first
business day of the month describing the previous month's activities.
These reports should be submitted via network mail to "IMR@ISI.EDU".

The Internet Monthly Report mailing list is now managed by MajorDomo at
ISI.EDU.  The announcements of new issues on the Internet Monthly Report
are sent to the IETF-Announce list and to this IMR list.

Requests to be ADDED or DELETED from the Internet Monthly report list
should be sent to "majordomo@isi.edu" with the message body either
"subscribe imr" or "unsubscribe imr".

Details on obtaining the current IMR, or back issues, via FTP or EMAIL
may be obtained by sending an EMAIL message to "rfc-info@ISI.EDU" with
the message body "help: ways_to_get_imrs".  For example:

INTERNIC
--------

     REGISTRATION SERVICES
     ---------------------

     The Following report covers the months of July, August, and
     September:


     I.  Significant Events

     * HostReg and CReg templates are now being processed automatically;
     previously they had to be processed manually; now about 50% are
     being processed automatically.

     * The auto-registration software now sorts requests into six
     groups:  (1) COM, (2) ORG, (3) NET, (4) GOV, (5) EDU and (6) TLD;
     this eliminates a manual step in the process and allows the ability
     to put an increased priority on GOV, EDU and TLD requests.

     * Plans to initiate a night shift are under development to assist
     in reducing the manual processing backlog.

     * Informal training was provided for Billing CSRs regarding how to
     register as a contact.

     * Selection and training of a second shift for processing support
     was completed; a full day training class was held on Saturday,
     September 10th; final staffing arrangements were completed for a
     night shift with a start date of September 30th.

     * A "SWAT Team" of existing staff was used to reduce the backlog.

     * Fax processing has become an overwhelming problem, requiring over
     four full-time equivalent employees.

     * Duane Stone and Carley Johnson represented the InterNIC DomReg
     Section at Network World Interop.

     * Testing of a share-ware Fax Server solution is going very well;
     it would make faxes available as e-mail; the fax viewer works very
     well on Sparc 5s and also supports sending faxes out; the MTS and
     Ack/Nak interfaces still need to be completed.

Internet Monthly Report                                   September 1996


     * DomReg software enhancements have reduced the number of requests
     that need to be processed manually from about 1,000 to 700 (30%
     improvement).

     * A method for gathering performance measurements was finalized and
     documented.

     INTERNIC DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES
     ----------------------------------------

     In September, our Harvest gatherer went into production operation.
     It currently gathers from our directory of directories pages, and
     offers search capabilities beyond those available using WAIS.  It
     also gives us the ability to index web pages.  We expect to index
     additional resources from inside and outside the InterNIC over
     time.

     To try out this system, look at:

            http://ds.internic.net/Harvest/brokers/dod/query.html

     To track new features on our servers, visit our "New Stuff" page:

                  http://ds.internic.net/new/newstuff.html

     This page is updated regularly.

     THE US DOMAIN REGISTRY
     ----------------------

     The US Domain now has an online line registration form.

     Some of the processing of the requests to the third level domain
     name is now automated. In particular, most requests to register
     names in localities already delegated are automatically forwarded
     to the administrator for that locality.

     The US Domain administrator no longer makes direct registrations of
     hosts, and only makes delegations of third or fourth level domain
     names (such as localities).

     A new policy has been added to the criteria for delegating domain
     names under the US Domain:

        It is the intention that the delegation of third level (for
        example, locality) domain names be wide spread to many
        registries.  It is undesirable for one person or organization
        to manage a large part of the third level names in any
        particular geographic or logical area.

        No individual or organization shall have more than 500
        delegations total in the US Domain as a whole, or more than 50
        delegation in any particuilar second level (for example, a
        state).

     About the special domains under the state codes.

        The K12, CC, TEC, LIB, STATE, DST, COG and GEN domain under
        each state are established for special purposes (see RFC 1480).







IMR Editor                                                     [Page 14]

Internet Monthly Report                                   September 1996


        In addition to the constaint to use them only for the
        defined purpose, each of these special domains is also
        to delegated only to a manager  within the state, and the
        operation of the delegated registry should be non-profit.

        The LIB domain should be managed by a govermental or
        educational library organization.

        Further, it is most appropriate for the K12, CC, and TEC,
        domains to be managed by an educational organization (for
        example, a university or a department of education).

        The STATE domain is most appropriately managed by an agency
        of the state government.  DST and COG should be managed by a
        goverment agency.

        The GEN domain may be delegated to any organization that
        will provide the registration service for free (and remember
        the purpose of the GEN domain is to register statewide
        non-profit organizations).

     To obtain a copy of the list of other delegated localities and
     subdomains not administered by the US Domain Registrar, get the
     file "us-domain-delegated.txt".

MERIT INTERNET ENGINEERING
--------------------------

     This report summarizes September 1996 activities of Merit's
     Internet Engineering group on behalf of the Routing Arbiter (RA)
     service and other projects.

     The National Science Foundation has announced a new direction for
     the Routing Arbiter project, which was charged by NSF in 1994 with
     the task of providing routing coordination in the post-NSFNET
     environment.  The announcement, which followed the 24-month review
     of the Routing Arbiter and the four Network Access Point projects,
     noted that all these projects had completed their basic missions
     ahead of schedule.  The RA project is a partnership between Merit
     and the University of Southern California Information Sciences
     Institute.  George Strawn, networking division director at the NSF,
     commended the Routing Arbiter for its performance during the past

     now proven that multiple network providers can work together in a
     competitive marketplace, and so can be scheduled for transition to
     commercial operations themselves."  NSFNET program director Mark
     Luker said that researchers from the RA and the NAPs will now focus
     on connections and routing for advanced networking, and noted that
     "both actions help NSF to move to the next stage, a stronger focus
     on the high-performance Internet of the future needed to support
     today's advanced research."  Merit is working with NSF to define
     its refocused activities for the RA project.

     Elise Gerich, Associate Director of Merit for National Networking,
     resigned her position to take a job in private industry.  Elise
     joined Merit in 1987 in support of the NSFNET Backbone Service
     project, and focused on technical interfaces and policy
     interactions between the regional networks, sister Federal
     agencies, and international network research organizations.  She
     was named Manager of the Internet Engineering group in 1994, was
     promoted to Associate Director in July 1995, and was also a Co-
     Principal Investigator for the Routing Arbiter project.  Elise was
     instrumental in providing a smooth transition for the regional
     networks to the new NSFNET architecture.  We wish her continued
     success in her new position!

     Merit invites applications for both the Associate Director and
     Manager of Internet Engineering positions; for further information,
     contact Merit President Eric Aupperle (313/764-9430,
     ema@merit.edu).

     Last month's report described a new incremental update client
     implemented for the Routing Arbiter Database by Jerry Winters.  At
     that writing, the client was polling the RIPE registry's mirroring
     site every 30 minutes for database updates; previously, updates had
     only been provided once each day.  The new client is now polling
     the RIPE site every 15 minutes; eventually, Merit expects that
     polls will occur every five minutes.

     A new tool known as IPN, Inter-Provider Notification, is now
     available on the RA Web pages:

     IPN is a public bulletin board that Internet Service Providers and
     NAP operators can use to announce scheduled maintenance and ongoing
     network outages.  IPN participants include major Internet Service
     Providers who BGP-peer at one or more of the primary exchange
     points.  We encourage providers to participate in testing and
     developing the new tool; improved coordination and cooperation
     among providers will lead to a better-managed and more stable
     Internet.  To join the IPN, send e-mail to:

                                outage@ra.net

     Brian Renaud attended the 25th RIPE meeting in Amsterdam, where he
     participated in sessions of the Routing and Database Working
     Groups.

     Finally,  the effort on the Merci project has paid off, with help
     from HP and LBL, and the audio, text and (LBNL) video tools rat,
     nte and vic all work on the various Microsoft Windows platforms.
     Availability soon.
