     Ann Westine Cooper (Cooper@ISI.EDU)

     NSF Regional reports - To obtain the procedure describing how to
     submit information for the Internet Monthly Report, send an email
     message to mailserv@is.internic.net and put "send imr-procedure" in
     the body of the message (add only that one line; do not put a
     signature).

Requests to be added or deleted from the Internet Monthly report list
should be sent to "imr-request@isi.edu".

     Details on obtaining the current IMR, or back issues, via FTP or
     EMAIL may be obtained by sending an EMAIL message to "rfc-
     info@ISI.EDU" with the message body "help: ways_to_get_imrs".  For
     example:

             To: rfc-info@ISI.EDU

                  IETF Monthly Report for February, 1994

     1. Let me remind everyone that the next IETF meeting will be held
        in Seattle, Washington from March 29 through April 1, 1994. This
        meeting is being hosted by NorthWestNet.

        Following the March 1994 meeting, the IETF will be meeting in
        Toronto July 25-29. The third meeting of the year will be in the
        San Francisco Bay Area. Arrangements are still underway, but it
        looks like the meeting will be the first week of December. Once
        the final arrangements have been made, notifications will be
        sent to the IETF Announcement list. Remember that information
        on future IETF meetings can be always be found in the file 0mtg-
        sites.txt which is located on the IETF shadow directories.

     2. The IESG approved or recommended the following two Protocol
        Actions during the month of February, 1994:

        o  Definitions of Managed Objects for the SONET/SDH Interface
           Type as a Proposed Standard.

        o  Definitions of Managed Objects for Frame Relay Service as a
           Proposed Standard.

     3. The IESG issued seven Last Calls to the IETF during the month
        of February, 1994:

        o  Definitions of Managed Objects for SNA NAUs
           <draft-ietf-snanau-snamib-03> for consideration as a Proposed
           Standard.

        o  Guidelines for OSI NSAP Allocation in the Internet
           <draft-ietf-osinsap-allocation-01> for consideration as a
           Draft Standard.

        o  TN3270 Extensions for LUname and Printer Selection
           <draft-ietf-tn3270e-luname-print-02> for consideration as a
           Proposed Standard.

        o  DNS Support for IDPR <draft-ietf-dns-idpr-02> for
           consideration as a Proposed Standard.

Internet Monthly Report                                    February 1994


        o  MIME Encapsulation of Macintosh files - MacMIME
           <draft-faltstrom-macmime1-01> for consideration as a Proposed
           Standard.

        o  MIME Content Type for BinHex encoded files
           <draft-faltstrom-macmime2-00> for consideration as an
           Informational document.

        o  UPS Management Information Base <draft-ietf-upsmib-05> for
           consideration as a Proposed Standard.

     4. Three Working Groups were created during this period:

           Notifications and Acknowledgements Requirements (notary)
           Simple Internet Protocol Plus (sipp)
           Common Architecture for Next-Generation IP (catnip)

        Note that sipp is actually the consolidation of SIP and PIP, and
        that CATNIP is a revamp of TPIX (with a new charter and
        milestones).

        Additionally, one Working Groups was concluded:

           Network Printing Protocol (npp)

     5. A total of 49 Internet-Draft actions were taken during the month
        of February, 1994:

                 (Revised draft (o), New Draft (+) )

      (bgp)      o  Definitions of Managed Objects for the Fourth
                    Version of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP-4)
                    <draft-ietf-bgp-mibv4-05.txt>

INTERNET PROJECTS
-----------------

ANSNET/NSFNET BACKBONE ENGINEERING
----------------------------------

     Network Status Summary
     ======================

     All ANSnet unix-based routers were upgraded to support gated
     software, which supports BGP4/CIDR.  The older rcp_routed software
     has been completely phased out of the ANSnet.  Configurations that
     support CIDR aggregation will be deployed in March.

     February Backbone Traffic Statistics
     ====================================

     The total inbound packet count for the ANSnet (measured using SNMP
     interface counters) was 48,359,374,681 on T3 ENSS interfaces, up
     5.6% from January.  The total packet count into the network
     including all ENSS serial interfaces was 56,238,624,890 up 4.46%
     from January.

     Router Forwarding Table Statistics
     ==================================

     The maximum number of destinations announced to the ANSnet during
     February was 17,713 up 8.8% from January.  The number of network
     destinations configured for announcement to the ANSnet but were
     never announced (silent nets) during February was 6,419.

     Gated/BGP4 Deployment Complete
     ==============================

     On February 27th, we completed the deployment of gated software on
     all ANSnet AS690 routers.  The AS690 system is now CIDR capable.
     All routers are running IBGP4 internally, and we are peering
     externally via BGP (using version negotiation for versions 2,3,4)
     and EGP.  The peer providers that we are exchanging BGP4 routes
     with include:

     AlterNet             (AS701)
     BARRNet              (AS200)
     CERFNet              (AS1740, AS1838)
     COREN                (AS2882)
     Dante                (AS1133, AS1674)
     ESNet                (AS293)
     ICMNet               (AS1240, AS1800)



Cooper                                                          [Page 8]

Internet Monthly Report                                    February 1994


     NASA                 (AS297, AS372)
     NEARNet              (AS560)
     OARNet               (AS600)
     SESQUINet            (AS114)
     SURANet              (AS86)

     Because the AS690 configuration for all CIDR aggregates has not yet
     been completed, we have left AS690 pointing default to AS1133.  The
     AS690 default route will be removed when all CIDR routes (for which
     class-based routes are not being announced) have been configured.

     We are working on a tool that would allow us to monitor which more
     specific class-based routes (that are represented by announced
     aggregates) are getting withdrawn on a weekly basis.  We hope this
     will allow us to debug any connectivity problems that are reported,
     which may be correlated to CIDR transition.

     There are a number of planned enhancements to gated that we will be
     deploying over the next few weeks including (a) support for FDDI
     broadcast media that interconnect CNSS routers, (b) reduction of
     the IBGP4 internal mesh from 92->60 (approximately), (c) reduction
     in gated memory utilization, (d) enhanced support for gated policy.

     Rcp_routed Routing Software Changes
     ===================================

     As of February 27th, Rcp_routed software has been replaced by
     gated.   Many thanks are owed to Curtis Villamizar, Steve Heimlich,
     and Yakov Rekhter for their work on rcp_routed over the years.

     Routing Stability Measured on the T3 Network
     ============================================

     Internal routing stability measurements are made by monitoring
     short term disconnect times (disconnects of five minutes duration
     or less).  This is intended as a measure of overall system
     stability rather than complete connectivity.  February stability
     was down from the prior month due to gated routing software
     deployment:

     Stability figures for the 2nd half of February are incomplete due
     the rcp_routed transition to gated software, and will be updated in
     March to support gated logging information.

     External route flap measured by ANSnet routers increased in
     February.  This is most likely secondary flapping resulting from
     route flaps caused by the ANSnet gated deployment.  The measurement
     method is described in:

       ftp.ans.net:/pub/info/routing-stats/ExternalRouteFlapReports

     This report measures overall Internet stability associated with the
     number of times networks are announced as unreachable.  The
     following represents the monthly totals in terms of number of
     networks declared unreachable per hour during the last 12 months.

     Notable Outages in February '94
     ===============================

     E131 (Ann Arbor) suffered an extended outage due to a fiber cut on
     02/02.  The 02/02 fiber cut was caused by contractor digging and
     affected 92 DS3's.  The outage lasted from 10:05 to 21:13 EST for a
     total of 11 hours and 8 minutes downtime.  While the Network
     Operations Center in Ann Arbor was isolated from the national
     network, network monitoring continued from the ANS backup NOC in
     Elmsford.  The Ann Arbor NOC accessed these monitoring tools via
     dialup connections.  There was some blockage of calls to the 1-800
     number due to reduced capacity into the area.

     Defense Simulation Internet
     ===========================

     DSI Network Upgrade
     ===================

     In February, the DSI backbone bandwidth was increased to an
     effective throughput rate of 2.6 Mbit/s.

     New ST-II Protocol Software Deployed
     ====================================

     All sites now have the new ST-II version 2.0 protocol software.
     Among other capabilities, version 2.0 provides a new interface
     (designated E3I) for connecting a secure gateway to the Network
     Encryption System (NES).  Version 2.0 also has a new commands
     interface and a new file-compression utility.

     Scalability

     Under its Defense Simulation Internet (DSI) Engineering contract
     from ARPA (ASTO), BBN is tasked to study the issue of "scalability"
     from the perspective of network performance and functionality.  The
     Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) user community has
     ambitious goals for dramatically increasing the scale of simulated
     war-fighting exercises.  While the largest exercises to date have
     involved less than 1000 "entities" (tanks, planes, ships, etc.),
     planned future exercises may involve as many as 100,000.  Moreover,
     the average size of updates exchanged among simulated entities has
     grown with the development of the DIS messaging standard.  Cost

Internet Monthly Report                                    February 1994


     constraints preclude solving this problem by order-of-magnitude
     increases in network bandwidth.  Instead, it is more likely that
     changes to both the DIS applications and the technological basis of
     supporting network(s) will be necessary to accommodate this growth.

     During February, work continued on two subtasks.  The first task
     involves characterization of DIS network traffic and DSI
     performance.  Statistics collected during demonstrations at
     November's Industry/Interservice Training, Simulation and Education
     Conference (I/ITSEC) and during the first of several Synthetic
     Theater of War (STOW) Engineering Demonstrations are being
     analyzed.  One component of the collected data consists of actual
     packet traces collected using the utility 'tcpdump'.  This month,
     we completed a program that fully parses simulation updates of both
     the Simnet protocol and the DIS protocol (an IEEE standard).  This
     program was then applied to the traces in order to correlate
     traffic statistics, such as delay, throughput and packet size, with
     simulation entities.  This level of detail is of value in
     predicting the traffic loads of future exercises.  Since one host
     can typically generate as many as 50-60 entities, and since update
     frequencies vary with the virtual activity of an exercise, it is
     not enough to observe traffic at the host level.

     The second task consists of further development of the DSI network
     simulator.  This tool, part of the Scalability Toolset, is being
     equipped with a graphical user interface for easy editing and
     configuration of the topology of the modeled network.  This month,
     work focused on fixing bugs and enhancing the cosmetic features of
     the display.  We also provided support to Lincoln Laboratory in
     their porting of the Network Simulator to the SGI workstation in
     preparation for further distribution of the Scalability Toolset to
     other members of the DIS research community.  (BBN's version runs
     on a Sun SPARC-2.)

     --------------

     The number of open records (contacts awaiting attention) closed by
     Reference Desk staff was almost double the number closed in January
     due to new staff hirings.  The backlog of open records was reduced
     from 2,560 to 229 in the same period. The following table gives a

     Our WAIS server is available on the standard WAIS port (port 210)
     on our server, ds.internic.net.  If you do not have a WAIS client,
     you can telnet to our server, login as "wais" (no password
     required), and use our client.

     A reminder - if you would like to help the Internet community find
     a resource that you offer, send mail to admin@ds.internic.net and
     we will send information about listing your resource in the
     Directory of Directories.

     REGISTRATION SERVICES
     Significant Events
     ---------------------

     InterNIC Registration Services assigned over 14,754 network
     addresses and registered 826 new top- and second-level domains.  A
     top-level domain for Algeria, DZ, was registered and applications
     from Bahrain, Belarus, and Iran were also received.  A number of
     service providers have begun implementing inverse addressing on
     their existing CIDR blocks.  Registration Services is working with
     each of these providers in transistioning inverse addressing so no
     customers are inconvenienced.

     US DOMAIN ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION
     ------------------------------------

     See "RFC 1591 - Domain Name System Structure and Delegation".


     US DOMAIN NAMING STRUCTURE
     ==========================

    <host>.<city/locality>.<state>.US = city/locality based names
   <school>.<district>.K12.<state>.US = kindegarten thru 12th grade
          <school>.PVT.K12.<state>.US = private K thru 12th grade
       <school>.<locality>.<state>.US = locality opt: for PVT schools
               <school>.CC.<state>.US = community colleges
              <school>.TEC.<state>.US = technical or vocationalschools
            <lib-name>.LIB.<state>.US = libraries
          <org-name>.STATE.<state>.US = state government agencies
            <org-name>.COG.<state>.US = councils of governments
         <museum-name>.MUS.<state>.US = museums
                 <org>.GEN.<state>.US = statewide assoc,clubs,domainparks
                    <org-name>.FED.US = federal government agencies
                    <org-name>.DNI.US = distributed national institutes


     IN-ADDR RECORDS
     ===============

     1)  The administrator of your network has to add to his nameserver
         an IN-ADDR PTR record for your host.  For example:

         11.8.146.198.IN-ADDR.ARPA    PTR     DSCC.CC.TN.US (hostname)

     2)  The network number needs to be listed in the root servers
         IN-ADDR zone file on the Internic with a NS delegation to
         your name server.  Send message to (netreg@internic.net).
         In the root server the following type of record is added:

         8.146.198.IN-ADDR.ARPA   NS    dsccvv.dscc.tn.us (nameserver)

MERIT/NSFNET INTERNET ENGINEERING
---------------------------------

     The CIDR/BGP-4 registration system was completed and installed in
     parallel with the deployment of gated on the ANS/NSFNET backbone. The
     Merit Policy Routing Data Base supports CIDR aggregation and the NACR
     submission format has been changed to reflect this.  For example the
     NWG report includes CIDR prefixes rather than single IP network
     numbers.

     Merit sponsored and SDSC hosted a meeting of the Regional Techs group
     in San Diege on Jan 31/Feb 1, 1994. The group's original charter
     defined its membership as the NSF sponsored regionals (mid-levels).
     At the meeting in San Diego, the group revised its charter to include
     a broader base of network service providers. Merit will continue to
     facilitate the meetings of the group and it is debating a new name.

     The target date for the release of IDRP version 1.0 is the end of
     March.  This version will support a minimal policy set and inter-
     operate with gated.  The team of implementors led by Sue Hares is
     doing this work for the FAA.

NORTHWESTNET
------------

     NorthWestNet and the University of Washington are pleased to co-
     sponsor the 29th IETF in Seattle, Washington from March 28-April 1.
     NorthWestNet has made available a Seattle IETF Gopher at
     gopher.nwnet.net 3333. You'll find a broad range of local
     information including weather, transportation, restaurants,
     lodgings, and local attractions. (For questions about the IETF,
     contact CNRI at ietf-rsvp@cnri.reston.va.us or gopher to
     cnri.reston.va.us.)

     The topic at this month's NorthWestNet User Services Committee
     teleconference was Internet training. Dave Tindall, Executive
     Director of Computer and Information Systems at Seattle Pacific
     University, moderated the meeting. The discussions covered
     everything from electronic and paper materials to the proper
     sequence to use when introducing Internet applications and tools.

     Twelve hours of on-site training were provided to 26 K-12 teachers
     and administrators at the Catlin Gable school in Portland, Oregon.
     Participants were affiliated with Catlin Gable (a private school)
     and with Oregon state school districts that are part of the
     statewide Oregon Public Education Network (OPEN) program of the
     Oregon State Department of Education. (Catlin Gable is also a
     participant in the NSF-funded grant, "Enabling K-12 Education in
     the Pacific Northwest through Internetworking.") Both OPEN and
     Catlin Gable are NorthWestNet member organizations.

     And last but not least, a group of students and teachers from The
     Bush School in Seattle, Washington spent part of an afternoon at
     the NorthWestNet offices exploring World Wide Web and HTML servers
     from around the world as part of a special class project.

RARE SECRETARIAT
----------------

     A RARE UPDATE                           no. 11, February 1994

     The 28th meeting of the RARE Council of Administration took place
     on February 3 and 4 1994. Progress and results on major issues are
     summarized below.

     CEENet

     A new international networking association has recently been
     established: CEENet, of which the members are at the moment: ACONET
     (Austria), UNICOM (Bulgaria), CARNet (Croatia), CESNET (Czech
     republic), NASK (Poland), SANET (Slovakia) and UARNet (Ukraine).
     More CEEC members are expected to join shortly.  The members are
     networking organizations that represent their country with
     authorization from their government.  CEENet's role is to
     coordinate international aspects of academic and research
     networking in the CEEC region.

     CEENet applied to join RARE in recognition of RARE's role as the
     umbrella body for networking for research in Europe and was
     admitted as International Member during the Brussels meeting.  A
     planning group has been set up to discuss how best to coordinate
     infrastructure planning and to function as a point of reference.

     RARE/EARN merger

     With the overall target of strengthening user representation in
     Europe the Executives of EARN and RARE are progressing a merger
     between the two Associations.

     Several documents are being drafted, such as a Constitution,
     Mission and Objectives statement, Technical programme and

     structure, Secretariat structure and three year budget.  These
     documents will be presented to both the CoA and the EARN Board of
     Directors for comment and approval during the May meetings in
     Darmstadt.  The Executives will propose to establish the new
     organization in the Netherlands, with the current RARE Secretariat
     as the main secretariat.  Current thinking has it that
     International Treaty Organizations will have voting rights and that
     voting will be according to a key related to level of subscription.

     RARE Signatory of ICT MoU

     RARE has signed the Memorandum of Understanding on Partnership in
     Information and Communication Technology (ICT), an EC initiative
     targeting enhancing user involvement in ICT.

     Elections Executive Committee

     Kees Neggers from SURFnet, the Netherlands, was re-elected
     President.  Paul Van Binst, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, was
     elected Vice-President and Peter Bakonyi, from Hungary, Treasurer.
     Sven Tafvelin (Sweden) and Christian Michau (France) are the new
     members of the Executive Committee.  The new RARE Executive
     Committee takes office on 1 May 1994.

     RARE Technical Programme

     RARE will establish a project involving evolution of the concept
     and protocols and maintenance of the reference implementation of
     World Wide Web and seeks funding for this project.

     The RARE Technical Committee is planning a Europe wide effort to
     coordinate the INIX and D-GIX activities and will raise the funding
     for this coordination effort.

     The RARE Technical Committee's management structure will change.
     The new RTC will consist of all WG Conveners and will be assisted
     by three senior general experts, who will form the RTC Budget
     Committee.  This way the RTC will have closer contact with the
     Working Groups.

     Thanks to the arrival of a new Project Development Officer, John
     Martin, working from the RARE Secretariat, the support for the RARE
     Technical Programme has increased considerably. The support for the
     RTP now consists of 2.6 full time equivalent PDOs and one Technical
     Programme Assistant.

     Conferences and seminars

     The final report on the NATO Advanced Networking Workshop on
     Research Networking in Central and Eastern Europe that took place
     in Budapest last Autumn will be available from the fileserver,
     soon.  The Workshop was very well attended and regarded to be very
     useful.

     A further activity of RARE supported by NATO funding is a technical
     workshop covering management and user support (to which the ISUS
     Working Group will contribute) just prior to the INET '94 / JENC 5
     Conference in Prague.

     The preliminary programme with the registration information for the
     INET '94 / JENC 5 Conference in Prague, June 15 - 17, will be
     released shortly.

     The Conference will start on 14 June at 18:30 with an Welcome and
     Opening reception.  The actual programme starts on 15 June and runs
     until noon on the 17th.  The conference consists of 35 sessions (in
     five parallel streams) and 4 plenaries.  Paper copies of all papers
     will be available at registration.  To be added to the email
     distribution list for more information on the Conference send a

     EARN is organizing a Network Services Conference in London, from 28
     to 30 November, subsequent to which a large RARE Working Group
     meeting will take place.

     The 3rd Symposium on High Speed Networking for Research in Europe,
     jointly organized by EC's DG XIII/C and RARE, was held on 2
     February 1994.  It was very successful, with 148 participants from
     24 countries, including two people from Japan.  It is planned to
     organize a fourth Symposium on High Speed networking for Research
     in Europe, focussing on 155 Mbps and higher, in two or three years'
     time.  The proceedings will be published in CNRE.
