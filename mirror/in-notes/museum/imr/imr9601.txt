INTERNET ENGINEERING REPORTS
----------------------------

     1. Let me remind everyone that the next IETF is being held in Los
        Angeles, California from March 4-8, 1996. There will not be a
        local host for this meeting, but the terminal room facilities
        will be provided by Interop. Following Los Angeles, the IETF
        will be meeting in Montreal, Quebec, Canada from June 24-28,
        1996. If this date looks familiar, it is the same date as
        INET '96! This is not a "joint" meeting per se, but both
        meetings will be held in the Montreal Convention Center, and the
        terminal room will be provided by INET. Closing out the year,
        the IETF will be returning to San Jose, California on December
        9-13, 1996.

        Following that, the IETF travels to Memphis, Tennessee to meet
        April 7-11, 1997. Federal Express will be the host for the first
        meeting of 1997.

        Once all the arrangements have been made, notifications will be
        sent to the IETF Announcement list. Remember that information
        on future IETF meetings can be always be found in the file
        0mtg-sites.txt which is located on the IETF shadow directories.
        This information can also be viewed from the IETF Home Page on
        the Web. The URL is:

                     http://www.ietf.cnri.reston.va.us


     2. The minutes of the IESG teleconferences have been publicly
        available on the IETF Shadow directories since 1991. These
        files are placed in the /ftp/iesg directory.

        The following IESG minutes have been added:

           December 21, 1995 (iesg.95-12-21)

     3. The IESG approved or recommended the following two Protocol
        Actions during the month of January, 1996:

        o  Address Allocation for Private Internets be published as a
           Best Current Practices RFC.

        o  Transition Mechanisms for IPv6 Hosts and Routers be published
           as a Proposed Standard.


     4. The IESG issued two Last Calls to the IETF during the month of
        January, 1996:

        o  IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
           <draft-ietf-addrconf-ipv6-auto-07> for consideration as a
           Proposed Standard.

           Subnetworks <draft-ietf-rolc-apr-04> for consideration as an
           Informational RFC.


     5. One Working Group was created during this period:

           Realtime Traffic Flow Measurement (rtfm)

        and one working group was concluded:

           Trusted Network File Systems (tnfs)


     6. A total of 77 Internet-Draft actions were taken during the month

     REGISTRATION SERVICES

     Progress Report for period January 1, 1995 through January 31, 1995

     I.  Significant Events

     InterNIC Registration Services assigned over 40,077 network
     addresses and registered over 4,099 domains.  Three top level
     domains were registered this month for Ghana (GH), Monaco (MC),
     and Nepal (NP).

     II.  Current Status

     During the month of January 1995, InterNIC Registration Services
     received communications as shown below.  The majority of the
     correspondence concerned the assignment and re-assignment of
     network numbers and the registration or change of domain names.

        E-mail     12,396      (hostmaster@internic.net)
        Postal/Fax    291    (primarily IP number requests)
        Phone       1,907

     The Registrations Services host computer supported a large volume
     of information retrieval requests during the month of December.

                   Connections   Retrievals
        Gopher      70,228          54,134

        Mailserv     6,358
        Telnet      71,061

     In addition, for WHOIS the number of queries were:

     INTERNIC DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES

     We recently upgraded our two backup systems to faster processors.
     Since all three of our processors now have roughly the same
     capacity, we are in the process of distributing the primary server
     for our different services.  This should result in increased
     performance for our users, since the primary machine for Archie,
     for example, is now different than the primary machine for Web
     access.

     All of our services are still available on all our machines for
     reliability, so if one machine is down, all the services are still
     available on the other two machines.

     Our Solaris porting activity has continued, and we expect to
     convert the first of our production machines in February.

     A reminder - if you would like to help the Internet community find
     a resource that you offer, send mail to admin@ds.internic.net and
     we will send information about listing your resource in the
     Directory of Directories.  If you prefer, you can enter information
     about your resource in our WWW suggestion form.  The form can be
     reached through our Directory of Directories Web page at:

     THE US DOMAIN REGISTRY

     The US Domain is only registering domain names providing two
     nameservers. We will no longer register direct registrations in the
     form of non-IP hosts, (i.e, UUCP connections requiring MX records),
     or IP hosts requiring A records).  The only A record we will add to
     our zone file is a glue record for a delegation.

     Please contact a local service provider to provide your primary and
     or secondary name service.

     For further information about the US Domain, send a message to:
     US-DOMAIN@ISI.EDU, or see our WEB page:

             http://www.isi.edu/us-domain

MERIT INTERNET ENGINEERING
--------------------------

     This report summarizes recent activities of Merit's Internet
     Engineering group on behalf of the Routing Arbiter (RA) service and
     other projects.

     Since the introduction of the Routing Arbiter Database in May 1995,
     Merit has been working closely with providers and end users to
     identify, correct, and remove inaccurate or obsolete records from
     the database.  Many of the obsolete records were remnants of the
     transition to the RADB from the Policy Routing Database (PRDB),
     which was used to configure the NSFNET backbone service.  As part
     of the RADB effort, Merit has:



Cooper                                                         [Page 14]

Internet Monthly Report                                     January 1996


     > Worked with the CA*net staff to remove approximately 3,000 Route
       objects duplicated in the CA*net registry.

     > Notified users about Route objects without the required
       information about Origin AS, or with advisory lines specifying
       non-existent peers, and modified the objects that were not
       corrected by users.

     > Worked with the community to create several hundred Maintainer
       objects for AS objects that had been converted from the PRDB and
       contained no information about the "owner" of the AS originating
       the route.

     RADB staff members Brian Renaud, Jerry Winters, and Xin Liu have
     recently focused on isolating and checking AS objects left over
     from the PRDB transition.  These records:

     > Had no policy lines (as-in, as-out, interas-in, etc.)

     > Had duplicates in the RIPE or internetMCI registries that contained
       more information than the RADB object

     > Had a last changed date preceding the NSFNET shutdown

     The staff sent e-mail to more than 150 individual maintainers--
     individuals authorized to modify the AS's database records--and
     noted that the object not only duplicated an entry in another
     registry, but also had less information in it than the entry in the
     other registry.  The object would be deleted in February unless the
     user instructed Merit otherwise.

     As users replied, Merit dealt with each response on a case-by-case
     basis, providing copies of duplicate objects, deleting (or asking
     users to delete) AS objects as well as Route objects that pointed
     to the AS objects; providing lists of AS objects that were not
     duplicated in other registries so the user could determine whether
     the records were still valid; and tracking provider efforts to
     remove multiple objects.  So far, more than 1000 objects have been
     deleted from the RADB as a result of this effort.

     New Route Server peering sessions were established this month by
     CERFnet, DRA Net, and Netrail.  More than 34 providers are now
     peering with the RSs at the interconnection points.  For a complete
     list of peers, see:

     Merit, which has been leading the GateD Consortium since fall 1995,
     has made significant enhancements to the GateD code.  Release
     3_5Alpha has been moved into beta; a new version, R3_6Alpha,
     offers:

     > A new autoconfiguration process; to build an object directory
       and create a config file, users simply enter a 'make autoconf'
       command and respond to the prompts.

     > A new GateD Interactive Interface (GII) that can be used to
       query internal variables such as memory usage and routing table
       contents. The GII also provides debugging and management tools.

     > DVMRP/PIM support, based on code from Tom Pusateri.

     > New documentation in PostScript, TeX, and HTML.

     For more information about GateD enhancements, see:

     Elise Gerich attended the European Operator's Forum and 23rd RIPE
