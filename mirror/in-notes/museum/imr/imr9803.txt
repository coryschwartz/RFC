INTERNET MONTHLY REPORTS
------------------------

The purpose of these reports is to communicate to the Internet Research
Group the accomplishments, milestones reached, or problems discovered by
the participating organizations.

Each organization is expected to submit a 1/2 page report on the first
business day of the month describing the previous month's activities.
These reports should be submitted via network mail to "IMR-ED@ISI.EDU".

`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

The Internet Monthly Report mailing list is now managed by MajorDomo at
ISI.EDU.  The announcements of new issues on the Internet Monthly Report
are sent to the IETF-Announce list and to this IMR list.

Requests to be ADDED or DELETED from the Internet Monthly report list
should be sent to "majordomo@isi.edu" with the message body either
"subscribe imr" or "unsubscribe imr".

Details on obtaining the current IMR, or back issues, via FTP or EMAIL
may be obtained by sending an EMAIL message to "rfc-info@ISI.EDU" with
the message body "help: ways_to_get_imrs".  For example:

        To: rfc-info@ISI.EDU
        Subject: getting imrs

INTERNET ENGINEERING REPORTS
----------------------------

                 Internet Monthly Report for March, 1998

  1. As I write this, the IETF is meeting in Los Angeles (March 30 -
     April, 3, 1998). The IETF's next meeting will be in Chicago,
     Illinois from August 24-28. Motorola has offered to be the local
     host. We're still making arrangements for the final meeting of
     1998 in Orlando, Florida. This meeting will be hosted by
     Microsoft.

     Once all arrangements have been made, notifications will be sent
     to the IETF Announcement list. Remember that information on
     future meetng sites can always be found in the file
     0mtg-sites.txt, located on the IETF shadow directories. Of
     course, this information is provided on the Web. The IETF's URL
     is:

                          http://www.ietf.org/

  2. The minutes of the IESG teleconferences be found on all the IETF
     shadow directories in the iesg directory.

     The following IESG minutes have been added:

       February 26, 1998 (iesg.98-02-26)


  3. The IESG approved or recommended the following 20 Protocol

     INTERNIC DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES

     InterNIC Directory and Database Services ended operation on April
     1, 1998 at the completion of our five year cooperative agreement
     with the National Science Foundation.

     Our final version of the Netfind seed database is available and
     contains 3.25 million entries.

     To ease transition for our users, we have set up a page of pointers
     to alternative sources for some of the information we provided.
     This page will be available at

             http://ds.internic.net

     for at least a month after our official shutdown.  In addition, we
     also have notices and pointers on some of our internal pages that
     users may have bookmarked.

     Our mail servers are also returning messages about the conclusion
     of our service, as do our telnet logins.  A partial list of

MERIT INTERNET ENGINEERING
--------------------------

     This report summarizes March 1998 activities of Merit's Internet
     Engineering group.

     Merit has successfully completed work on the Routing Arbiter
     project, funded by the National Science Foundation from July 1994
     through March 1998. A collaboration between Merit and the
     University of Southern California Information Sciences Institute,
     the project supported leading-edge routing, tool development, and
     research for the U.S.  Internet.  ISI continues to carry out
     advanced RA research in routing systems, protocols, and policies.

     Three services that originated as part of the RA project are now
     supported as independent activities.  In January 1997, following
     NSF's recommendation that Route Server services be shifted to the
     commercial marketplace, Merit launched the new Route Server Next
     Generation project (www.rsng.net), which makes it possible for
     exchange point operators to purchase Route Server services from
     Merit in support of customer peering.

     Following NSF's recommendation that statistical research and tool
     development be pursued separately from the Routing Arbiter
     activity, a proposal was submitted to NSF for support for a new

Internet Monthly Report                                       March 1998


     Internet Performance Measurement and Analysis project
     (www.merit.edu/ipma/). In fall 1997, Merit received a $1.6 million
     award from the National Science Foundation in support of the
     project, a joint effort between Merit and the Department of
     Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of
     Michigan's College of Engineering.

     NANOG, the North American Network Operators Group, was supported by
     NSF during both the NSFNET project and the early years of the
     Routing Arbiter project. NANOG is now funded independently through
     attendee registration fees (see www.nanog.org).

     Merit continues to support the RADB (www.merit.edu/radb/), a part
     of the Internet Routing Registry, until deployment of the
     distributed database system under development at ISI.  We are in
     the final stages of processing Routing Arbiter Database funding
     arrangements with five ISPs who have pledged financial support for
     the project.  We wish to thank our new commercial sponsors for
     generously supporting this important activity!

     Merit was well represented at the 41st IETF in Los Angeles, with
     members of the Internet Engineering group attending a variety of
     working group meetings.  Sue Hares led an informational GateD
     meeting during IETF that comprised technical briefings, status
     reports, and administrative updates.  Hares is Director of the
     GateD Consortium, which is based at Merit.

     Abha Ahuja continued advanced Cisco training at a course titled
     "Cisco Internetwork Troubleshooting," sponsored by the American
     Research Group.  Sue Hares attended the Internet Architecture Board
     Routing Workshop, which was led by Radia Perlman and Steve Deering.
     The workshop brought together members of the IAB and the Internet
     community with special expertise in routing protocols and design.
     Topics discussed included unicast/multicast scaling, routing
     security, NAT, and ToS/QoS routing.  Hares chairs the Internet
     Research Task Force Routing Research group, which explores routing
     problems that are important to the development of the Internet, but
     are not yet mature enough for engineering work within the IETF.

     * New RFCs added to queue throughout the month

     The Requests for Comments (RFCs) are a series of notes, started in
     1969, about the Internet (originally the ARPANET). The notes
     discuss many aspects of computing and computer communication
     focusing in networking protocols, procedures, programs, and
     concepts, but also including meeting notes, opinion, and sometimes
     humor. The specification documents of the Internet protocol suite,
     as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and its
     steering group (the IESG), are published as RFCs.

     RFCs-to-be are edited by the RFC Editor.  RFCs enter the RFC
     Editor's work queue either by an action of the IESG or by
     independent submission.  Most independent submissions are referred
     to the IESG to check for overlap with IETF work.  The IESG might
     put a hold on a document to gather more input from its members.
     The wait for an RFC to be published varies as there can be
     unforeseen complications (typically editorial matters that need
     clarification from the author).  Documents can be removed from the
     publication queue if they are found to be insufficient or incorrect
     or if the IESG asks the author to join work already in progress in
     the IETF.

     As of February 10th, 1998 the Initial Internet Protocol (IP)
     Address Space Requests From Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
     policy was revised.  This revision allowed for multi-homed ISPs who
     have utilized at least a /21 and agree to the policy can request a
     /20 from a reserved /19.  As of March 31st ten (10) ISPs have been
     allocated a /20 using this new policy.

     ARIN first members' meeting was held on March 20, 1998.  Following
     the meeting, members were welcomed to an open house at the ARIN
     office.

     ARIN's response to the Department of Commerce Green Paper on
     Internet Governance was submitted on March 23, 1998.
