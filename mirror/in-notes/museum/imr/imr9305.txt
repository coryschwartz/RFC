     PRIVACY AND SECURITY
     --------------------

        The PSRG will meet July 7-9 at Cambridge University, UK, the
        week prior to the IETF meeting in Amsterdam.  The focus of this
        meeting will be the evolving Internet Security Architecture
        Document.  PSRG members have been forwarding completed writing
        assignments to Rob Shirey, who is acting as editor for this
        document.  A draft of the document will be circulated among the
        PSRG members in June, in preparation for further editing during
        the meeting.

        In April the PSRG issued a call for papers for the Internet
        Society Symposium on Network and Distributed System Security,
        under the direction of the general chairs, Rob Shirey and Russ
        Housley.  This will be the second symposium organized by the
        PSRG on this topic and it will take place 3-4 February 1994,
        Catamaran Hotel, San Diego, California, the same venue and
        season as the first symposium.  The initial symposium attracted
        over 150 attendees and the proceedings were sufficiently popular
        as to require a second printing run.

INTERNET PROJECTS
-----------------

ANSNET/NSFNET BACKBONE ENGINEERING
----------------------------------

     Network Status Summary
     ======================

     The deployment of new AIX 3.2 operating software was nearly completed
     in May.  Five remaining routers will be upgraded during June.  This
     software increases the on-card forwarding table capacity to support
     12,000 destinations

     Planned topology changes to the T3 network will be deployed in June

     Internal routing stability measurements improved on the T3 network
     over the April measurements.

     Backbone Traffic and Routing Statistics
     =======================================

     The total inbound packet count for the network (measured using SNMP
     interface counters) was 29,991,341,011 on T3 ENSS interfaces.  The
     total packet count into the network including all ENSS serial
     interfaces was 33,883,217,693.

     As of May 31, the number of networks configured in the Merit Policy
     Routing Database was 12272 for the T3 backbone.  Of these, 3102 were
     never announced to the T3 backbone (e.g. silent nets).  The maximum
     number of networks announced to the T3 backbone during the month (from
     samples collected every 15 minutes) was 8961, up 8.8% from April.
     Average announced networks on 5/31 were 8768.

     Planned T3 Backbone Topology Changes
     ====================================

     During June '93, we expect to make a few changes to the T3 backbone
     circuit topology.  These topology changes are designed to improve
     circuit route diversity and avoid multiple circuit outages in the
     presence of a fiber cut.  The circuit changes include:

     1.   Add a T3 circuit between the Hartford CNSS and the Cleveland
          CNSS.

     2.   Add a T3 circuit between the Cleveland CNSS and the St. Louis
          CNSS.

Internet Monthly Report                                         May 1993


     3.   Remove the T3 circuit between the Greensboro CNSS and the
          Hartford CNSS.

     This will provide improved physical circuit diversity to avoid
     multiple circuit failures during a fiber cut.  The addition of the
     Hartford to North Royalton and hence the North Royalton to St.
     Louis T3s will result in three unique east-west T3 paths and
     eliminate the possibility of an east-west backbone partition
     resulting from two simultaneous circuit failures.  The new T3s were
     engineered to ensure that no two T3 circuits transit the same
     fiber, conduit, or physical path.  On-going studies are underway to
     segregate all T3 and T1 tail circuits and back-up T1s to the
     greatest extent possible in order to provide the maximum disaster
     protection through physical diversity.

     Rcp_routed Routing Software Changes
     ===================================

     During May one new release of the routing daemon, rcp_routed, was
     deployed.  The version named "Less Filling" contained numerous
     changes.  The major enhancement was to reduce memory consumption
     and improve locality of memory access when presented with a large
     numbers of routes.  This addressed paging problems that were
     beginning to occur on some ENSS nodes.  Release notes are available
     in:

         ftp.ans.net:/pub/info/t3-rcp_routed/Release-Notes

     Routing Stability Measured on the T3 Network
     ============================================

     Internal routing stability measurements are made by monitoring
     short term IBGP disconnect times (disconnects of five minutes
     duration or less).  This is designed to be a measure of routing
     stability rather than full mesh connectivity.  We monitor overall
     stability excluding the biweekly configuration windows.

     MONTH           overall    excluding configs

     January         99.1%            99.5%

     April           96.1%            97.2%
     May             97.4%            98.0%

     For the first time since January, the T1 link to E206 (CERN -
     Geneva, Switzerland) did not top the list of nodes exhibiting
     unstable connectivity.  During May, E206 was stable 99.82% of the

     time (1:18:50 overall for the month), with just under 40 minutes
     outside of the configuration window.  This accounted for much of
     the improvement.

     ENSS145 (Fix-E) suffered from a number of problems with the FDDI
     and ethernet adapters.  This node experienced 3:54:35 of
     instability over the month (99.47%) and 2:17:37 outside the
     configuration window (99.68%), which accounted for most of the
     instability.

     During May, there were a number of problems with intermittent
     CNSS-CNSS circuits.  Hard down CNSS-CNSS circuits result in lower
     measures of instability since these the T3 network maintains
     complete alternate routing for these links.  There was recurring
     problem with a T3 interface adapter on CNSS40 (Cleveland) on May
     28, 30, and May 31.  The adapter was replaced on June 1.

     As a result of the intermittent CNSS-CNSS circuits, 4 routers
     reported over 1 hour of instability outside the config window, 33
     nodes reported between 30 and 60 minutes, and 36 reported between
     15 and 30 minutes.  The remaining 52 nodes reported under 15
     minutes of instability (about 99.97% stable).

     MONTH           > 1hr      30-60 min   15-30 min   < 15 min

     January            1             5          16      60
     February           0             1           4      80
     March              2             1           7      78
     April              4             0           6      39
     May                4             33         36      52

     Because of the instability that results from failing circuits, work
     is in progress to detect packet loss on circuits in real time, and
     more quickly switch to internal alternate routes, thereby
     minimizing routing instability.

     Inter-Domain Policy Routing

     During the month of May, we have been conducting a pilot
     demonstration of IDPR in the Internet and will continue the pilot
     into the month of June.  We will publish the results in an Internet
     draft, planned for release in July.

     We have also been working on a multicast version of IDPR.  In May,
     we simplified the IDPR route generation software (to conform to the
     specification), in preparation for adding multicast route
     generation.  We have not yet modified the path control software to
     enable multicast path setup; this we plan to do in June.  We expect
     to experiment with multicast IDPR (with resource reservation) on
     DARTnet later in the summer.

     Scaleability

     During the past month, we finished implementing the additional
     statistic collection capabilities in the flow-level network
     simulator.  The simulator can now output delay and throughput
     information for all network elements, as well as pairwise end-to-
     end drop rates and delays.  Statistics may be output as either text
     or in a more compact binary format.

     Work is currently in progress on the network editor component of
     the simulator.  The simulator is now fully functional, but the
     network model must currently be compiled into the code.  The editor
     will allow the network topology and simulation parameters to be
     changed from a graphical user interface.

     In addition to simulator development, we have started testing the
     operation of the simulator's routing and delay models.

     (See December '92 Internet Monthly Report for more details about
     this project and the toolset being developed.)

     Real-Time Multicast Communications and Applications

     This month, we interfaced the video server to the BBN PICWIN
     desktop video conferencing system as a demonstration of another way
     to deliver video to the desktop.  We have been using the Parallax
     board to view video in a window on a workstation.  With the PICWIN
     interface, a user can view video in a window on a Sun workstation
     using software only; no specialized hardware is needed.  To the
     video server, a workstation running either the PICWIN software or a
     workstation equipped with Parallax hardware, is simply another
     video destination.  The model of video sources and destinations
     supported by the video server and applications makes it relatively
     easy to add either hardware or software solutions for displaying
     video on a workstation.  Although the PICWIN system supports a much
     lower frame rate than the Parallax board, it is an interesting
     demonstration of a software only solution for displaying video on a
     workstation.

     We also continued work on features of the video applications that
     will be used to demonstrate the new network communications features
     such as the ones described below.

     Our communications efforts this month have focused on the
     implementation of the shared streams service, and the resource
     coordination object (RCO) mechanisms used to associate resource
     reservation information with flow and group identification, and to
     propagate this data to routers.  Possible applications of shared
     streams include real-time data collection from distributed sensors
     and efficient multiplexing of related data flows, e.g., floor-
     controlled conferencing.  RCO's, in addition to being used for
     shared streams, could be used to support applications such as
     session management and multicast access control.

     To participate in a shared flow reservation, the sender emits a
     shared flow RCO, identifying the endpoints of the flow, an
     identifier for the flow group, and a flowspec (as described in RFC
     1363).  This type of RCO is "flow-tracking" -- that is, the RCO
     propagation mechanism forwards the RCO along the path(s) taken by
     the associated data flow.  Each network node along the flow's path
     keeps a copy of the RCO.  If the network node implements support
     for shared flows, the bandwidth information in the RCO is extracted
     and passed to the resource reservation mechanism in that node.

Internet Monthly Report                                         May 1993


     When routing changes occur, the RCO propagation mechanism forwards
     the RCO along the new route (and may also indicate that copies
     along the old route are no longer needed).

     Use of RCOs is transparent to the application using shared flows --
     a library interface is being created to provide the API for the
     shared flow service.  This library encapsulates communication with
     the RCO system, which operates as a general network service,
     independent of the application process and the shared stream
     service.

     (See January '93 and March '93 Internet Monthly Reports for more
     details about the application and communications services being
     developed.)

CONCERT
-------

     The Communications Research Group has finished most of the ground
     work for its packet video development project. A local testbed
     consisting of several SPARCstation 10's connected through an 8x8
     Fore Systems ATM switch (ASX-100) as well as an Ethernet segment
     has been set up.  Initial tests demonstrated sustained data rates
     of close to 18 Mbps from application to application. This testbed
     is expected to be used to realize the goals of high quality
     multipoint interactive video to the desktop over IP and ATM
     networks. It is anticipated that this activity will assume
     increasing significance as the recently announced North Carolina
     Information Highway begins deployment next year.

     The group has completed a software implementation of a H.261 CODEC.
     The preliminary implementation can decode full-color SIF (352x240)
     video images at about 3 frames per second on a Sparc 10/30. The
     encoder ran at about 1 frame per second with a compression ratio of
     40 to 1. The implementation is being extended with a hierarchical
     coding option and will be used in studying interactions between
     CODEC and network operations. In particular, the impact of IP
     priority mechanism on the quality and bandwidth requirement of
     video coding will be examined.

     Some initial tests have been conducted with the Parallax's XVideo
     card that supports frame capture and JPEG
     compression/decompression. The results showed that the current
     version of hardware and software can support video communication
     with full-color frames of 640x480 pixels at about 11 frames per
     second, between two Sparc 10/30's at about 1.5Mbps.  The
     corresponding video image quality was found quite acceptable. A new
     version of XVideo software promises full-motion rate (30
     frames/second).

     The main activity on JANET during April was the commissioning of
     the initial 34 Mbit/s IP data network as part of the SuperJANET

     project.  This consists of six sites: University College London
     (UCL), Imperial College (and onward to the Royal Postgraduate
     Medical School (RPMS) at Hammersmith Hospital), Rutherford Appleton
     Laboratory (RAL), Manchester University and Edinburgh University.
     Cambridge University and University of London Computer Centre
     (ULCC) will be added shortly and Glasgow University later in May.
     When ULCC is connected the network will also be attached to the
     international access points to JANET (the UK/US Fat-pipe, EBONE and
     EuropaNET).

     The network was built as a ring of 34 Mbit/s lines with a Cisco
     AGS+/4 with two HSSI interfaces at each vertex. Following
     difficulties in getting the Cisco kit on time (reported in last
     month's report), there was a considerable amount of last-minute
     moving of routers around the country involved but everything was
     ready for the first SuperJANET demonstration on 29 April. The
     network performed well at the demonstration, giving the subjective
     impression that there was no difference in speed in accessing data
     over the wide area than in doing so over the LAN.  (Subsequently,
     the RPMS reported obtaining a file transfer rate of 960 Kbyte/s to
     UCL -- two-hops away -- when setting up their demonstration, with
     standard file-transfer software.)

     The performance of the network has still to be measured more
     coherently, but initial ping tests show that the round-trip times
     between routers are as expected -- ie limited by propagation delays
     on the fibres involved.  (These range from 3-17 ms round-trip
     times.) An initial calculation suggests that in most cases any two
     points on the network should be within a 64 kbyte TCP window and
     hence it should be possible to drive the network to saturation
     using a suitable pair of end system TCP/IP implementations.
     Extended windows may be needed in some cases, however.

     At present the 34 Mbit/s network is being used as a pilot for the
     connection of the sites involved -- ie IP traffic between the sites
     flows over this network rather than the JIPS (JANET IP Service --
     the standard IP network offering on JANET) by default. JIPS
     connectivity between the sites remains as a backup, of course.
     (This was demonstrated on Friday 30 April when the SuperJANET
     connection into UCL was lost and IP connectivity to this site
     quickly dropped back to the JIPS.) Depending on the stability of
     the network, it is aimed to bring it into service as part of the
     JIPS during July 1993.

     Meanwhile, the use of the service network remained high. The total
     IP traffic switched across JANET in April was approximately 1000
     Gigabyte. Of this approximately 180 Gigabyte passed through the
     UK/US Fat-pipe, and approximately 112 Gigabyte to and from EBONE.

     The number of hosts attached can be measured, to first order, by
     the size of the ac.uk domain. As of end April it contained 57273
     distinct hosts in 301 subdomains. (This was an increase of 2935
     hosts and represents approximately 89% of the uk domain.)

     MichNet, with several other regionals, has been participating in
     the use of CIDR recommendations for the allocation of address space
     for its education, research and commercial users.  MichNet has been
     allocated a block of 1023 class C network numbers to use.  Thirteen
     of Michigan's fifteen four-year public universities have direct
     MichNet attachments.  Eight private colleges or universities, five
     community colleges and five K-12 schools also have direct
     attachments.  The supercomputer facilities operated by the U.S.
     Environmental Protection Agency in Bay City and by the U.S. Army
     Tank and Automotive Command (TACOM) in Warren both have 1.5Mbps
     attachments.

     Merit has completed work on the MichNet backbone upgrade.  The
     Grand Rapids node has been moved from Western Michigan University's
     Regional Center in Grand Rapids to the facilities of Teledial, Inc.
     Two new T1 lines have been homed to the relocated Grand Rapids node
     and the WMU Regional Center is linked using a 56Kbps tail circuit.
     A new T1 line links Grand Valley State University to the backbone,
     and another links Ferris State University through the Applied
     Technology Center at Grand Rapids Community College.

     The Network Access Server (NAS) evaluation project is part of a
     larger project to upgrade user connectivity to MichNet.  Dial-in
     asynchronous connectivity has been the focus of the NAS evaluation.
     Common connection establishment procedures have been determined to
     be the principle requirements which must be met by a NAS
     participting in the MichNet pool of ports, as well as the ability
     to interface with an authentication helper interfacing with several
     authentication servers.  The IETF Working Group, NASREQ, is
     pursuing this goal.  Merit has chosen to work with Livingston in
     implementing a pilot NAS which supports the MichNet requirements.
     The University of Michigan plans the installation of a 30 port
     Livingston Portmaster for beta test in early July.  The UofM
     machine will be used for PPP access only, with public availability
     to authenticated users with the completion of successful testing.
     Michigan State University is working with Xylogics, another vendor
     who has been actively working with NASREQ and interested in
     understanding and meeting these requirements.

     The Switched Multimegabit Data Service (SMDS) trial, conducted in
     conjunction with Ameritech and Michigan Bell, proceeded well and
     has been concluded.  Evaluation of the service determined it to be
     financially inappropriate for MichNet backbone services.  SMDS will
     be considered for MichNet service at speeds greater than 1.5Mbps
     (T1).  Merit has begun to use Ameritech's Frame Relay Service
     (FRS).  Frame Relay is now operational on T1 links between Ann
     Arbor, Flint, Oakland University, and Wayne State University.  The
     Ameritech FRS offering is a Permanent Virtual Circuit (PVC)-based

     service with access speeds between 56Kbps and T1.  There is no
     mileage sensitive fee component associated with FRS, but a flat
     rate charge for whatever speed is used.  FRS offers high-bandwidth
     connectivity at a lower cost.

MERIT/NSFNET ENGINEERING
------------------------

     Major projects for the month of May were the deployment of a
     prototype route server at the MAE-East ethernet, implementation of
     a program for automated submission of network announcement change
     requests, preparation for a meeting of the NSFNET Regional-Techs in
     June, continued IDRP development and progress on the Shared Whois
     Project.

     Route Server Deployment

     A SUN ELC was shipped to College Park, MD. The SURAnet staff is
     cooperatively assisting in the installation of the machine which is
     now being used as a route server running the GateD routing daemon.
     It has been configured to operate BGP peer sessions with the
     network service provider peers (including the NSFNET ENSS) and the
     RIPE route server. The route server is building a table of routes
     to destinations learned from those peers. Later it will be
     configured to announce routes back to the peers, in a controlled
     fashion coordinated with the other providers along with RIPE.

     Automated Submission of Routing Requests

     The following note was sent to the regional-techs group to announce
     a new method of submitting requests for routing.

     Authorized Routing Administrators:

     During the past months, we've been developing a scalable approach
     to the configuration of the NSFNET/ANSnet backbone as part of our
     continued effort to provide and maintain accurate routing
     information and a high level of service.

     To this end, Merit is pleased to announce

      - a new NACR (version 7.0), and

      - a new service, a NACR server, available via telnetting to
        merit.edu for filling out the new NACR.

Internet Monthly Report                                         May 1993


     WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?
     =====================

     We need this new NACR and server, and your help in converting to
     these, in order to expedite processing of your NACRs through:

       - enhancing validation of information _upon entry_ and aid in
         correcting it at that time,

       - reducing unnecessary mail,

       - providing for automatic 'cc'-ing of appropriate ASs,

       - allowing for parsing of consistent NACRs,

       - and more!

     This move is necessary in order to provide you with a reasonable
     level of service and to provide Merit with a scalable, less
     resource-intensive method of providing the configuration service.

     NEW NACR
     ========

     The new NACR is available via anonymous ftp:

        nic.merit.edu:nsfnet/announce.networks/template.net

     with helpful information in:

        nic.merit.edu:nsfnet/announced.networks/template.net.README.

     NOTE:  Merit will *only* accept v7.0 templates after 1 July 1993.

     NEW NACR SERVER
     ===============

     Some of the good points of this service are presented above;
     because we expect it to improve the accuracy and turnaround of your
     NACRs, we strongly urge you to try out this service, and work with
     us to improve it so that you will use it.  (Many thanks to Bill
     Manning for being our guinea pig!)

     If you'd like to use this, we need to set you up with an account,
     password, etc.; please send email to:

         autonacr@merit.edu
