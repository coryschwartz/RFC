     to be quoted in other publications without permission from the
     submitter.

Each organization is expected to submit a 1/2 page report on the first
business day of the month describing the previous month's activities.

These reports should be submitted via network mail to:

     Ann Westine Cooper (Cooper@ISI.EDU)

     NSF Regional reports - To obtain the procedure describing how to
     submit information for the Internet Monthly Report, send an email
     message to mailserv@is.internic.net and put "send imr-procedure" in
     the body of the message (add only that one line; do not put a
     signature).

Requests to be added or deleted from the Internet Monthly report list
should be sent to "imr-request@isi.edu".

     Details on obtaining the current IMR, or back issues, via FTP or
     EMAIL may be obtained by sending an EMAIL message to "rfc-
     info@ISI.EDU" with the message body "help: ways_to_get_imrs".  For
     example:

                              IETF MONTHLY REPORT


     1. The next meeting of the IETF will be held in Houston, Texas from
        November 1-5, 1993. This meeting is being co-hosted by SESQUINET
        and Rice University. Following that, arrangements for the first
        meeting of the IETF in 1994 have been made. That meeting will
        be held in Seattle, Washington from March 29 through April
        1,1994. This meeting is being hosted by NorthWestNet.

        Note that information on future IETF meetings can be always be
        found in the file 0mtg-sites.txt which is located on the IETF
        shadow directories.


     2. The IESG approved or recommended the following 10 Protocol
        Actions during the month of August, 1993:

        o  X.400 use of extended character sets as a Proposed Standard.
        o  Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol as a Proposed Standard.
        o  DHCP Options and BOOTP Vendor Extensions as a Proposed
           Standard.
        o  Interoperation Between DHCP and BOOTP as a Proposed Standard.
        o  Clarifications and Extensions for the Bootstrap Protocol as
           a Proposed Standard.

INTERNET PROJECTS
-----------------

ANSNET/NSFNET BACKBONE ENGINEERING
----------------------------------

     Network Status Summary
     ======================

     ANSnet stability improved in August over the July measurements.
     New routing software was deployed in the ANSnet to reduce
     instability, and simplify the reconfiguration process.

     August Backbone Traffic and Routing Statistics
     ==============================================

     The total inbound packet count for the network (measured using SNMP
     interface counters) was 31,945,944,041 on T3 ENSS interfaces, down
     2.87% from July.  The total packet count into the network including
     all ENSS serial interfaces was 37,652,126,636 up 1.02% from July.

     As of August 31, the number of networks configured in the Merit
     Policy Routing Database was 15249 for the T3 backbone.  Of these,
     3334 were never announced to the T3 backbone (e.g. silent nets).
     The maximum number of networks announced to the T3 backbone during
     the month (from samples collected every 15 minutes) was 10,879.

     Rcp_routed Routing Software Changes
     ===================================

     In mid August, the "Dynamic Reconfig" version of the rcp_routed
     routing daemon was replaced with the "Better IBGP Aggregation"
     version.  Problems with the dynamic reconfiguration feature are now
     corrected and the effects of configuration runs has been minimized.
     The "Better IBGP Aggregation" also has performance improvements
     that should improve stability outside of the configuration window.
     Release notes provide further details.  They can be found in:

         ftp.ans.net:/pub/info/t3-rcp_routed/Release-Notes

     Rcp_routed has now evolved to a very stable version quite capable
     of handling the high load of routing updates.  Handling of
     intermittent circuits was to be the next target for improvement,
     but rcp_routed will most likely be replaced by Gated within a
     month.  Rcp_routed will be retiring shortly.  Further development
     will be targeted at gated.

     Routing Stability Measured on the T3 Network
     ============================================

     Internal routing stability measurements are made by monitoring
     short term disconnect times (disconnects of five minutes duration
     or less).  This is intended as a measure of stability rather than
     complete connectivity.  Stability during August was 97.5% including
     disruptions during the configuration windows.  Excluding the
     configuration windows, stability was 97.9%.  This is a slight
     improvement over July.

     July stability was improved over June.  August was a further
     improvement over July.  This was despite severe circuit problems at
     ENSS136 (College Park) on August 19, 20, 22, and 24.

     The access T3 circuit from CNSS58 to ENSS136 was changed.  The
     local carrier portion of the T3 circuit was highly unreliable for
     over a week.  Congestion on the T1 backup circuit was quite severe,
     and SURAnet had to disable it's FDDI peers at ENSS136 at times to
     force backup through the T3 ENSS138 at Georgia Tech.  ENSS136 saw
     about 6:33 hours of instability (99.1% stable).

     ENSS230 (Digital Express) continued to have circuit problems and/or
     [CSU problems in early August.  A zeros density problem seems to
     have been the cause.  ENSS230 saw 4-3/4 hours of instability (99.5%
     stable).  ENSS222 had circuit trouble.  ENSS145 (Fix-E) had
     problems involving CPU loading due to EGP processing.  ENSS135 (San
     Diego) had problems due to local power, and UPS power problems in
     the adjacent MCI POP (CNSS16, CNSS17, CNSS19).  Each of these
     ENSS's had 2-1/2 to 3 hours of instability, though for ENSS135 much
     of it was during the configuration window (only 47 minutes outside
     the window).  CNSS16, CNSS17, and CNSS19 saw approximately 2 hours
     of instability, approximately 1 hour each during the configuration
     window.

     The number of nodes experiencing a great deal of outage improved
     over June and July, though ENSS136 shows up in the >5hr column.

     The breakdown by sites is as follows (these figures include
     instability seen during configuration runs):

     During August, MCI corrected the problems with the St. Louis to
     Denver link and other links in the area which previously suffered
     outages associated with flooding in the midwest.  This accounts for
     much of the shift toward improved stability.  Only half as many
     nodes saw over 2 hours of instability and far more saw under 15
     minutes and 30 minutes.

     Route Table Growth
     ==================

     The number of networks actually announced to ANSNET grew by about
     7.5% in August.  There were 15,249 configured networks by the end
     of August.  The maximum number of routes observed was 10,879.

                MONTH           MAX          Growth RATE(%)

                02/93           7037             5.76
                03/93           7767            10.37
                04/93           8239             6.08

                08/93          10879             7.57

     On average for routes that were announced, the primary route was in
     use 98.8% of the time, secondary was used 1.6% of the time and a
     tertiary or less preferred route was used less than 0.6% of the
     time (due to rounding this adds to 101%).

     There were 3,334 networks configured by August 1 or earlier but
     were never announced during the the entire month (silent nets).
     Eight peer networks had over 100 each, accounting for 2,266 of

     these.  There were 4,105 networks configured by August 20 but never
     announced by the last week of August.

     Real-Time Multicast Communications and Applications

     During August, testing was completed in the DARTNet on shared
     stream service.  At this point, implementation and basic testing
     has been done for the 4 realtime multicast communications services
     -- anycasting, multi-level flows, Resource Coordination Objects
     (RCOs), and shared streams -- and we have begun integrating them
     with distributed real-time applications.

     We began working on the nv video program to add multi-level
     multicast flow support to it.  This involves using a high frame
     sampling rate, and tagging the outgoing packets with different
     priority levels.  E.g., half of the frames are marked with the
     lowest priority value, 1/4 of the frames with the next-higher
     value, etc.  A receiving nv application can then pick a frame rate
     based on processing capability and available bandwidth, and request

     all frames at and above a cut-off level.  With proper pruning and
     multi-level flow support in mrouted and DVMRP, this will allow
     optimal forwarding of multicast packets, with packets from unwanted
     subflows being dropped along routes containing only low-rate
     receivers.

     The RCO paper that we mentioned last month has turned into two
     papers, one on the general concepts and design of the RCO system,
     and one describing the prototype protocol and implementation
     details.  These should be available for distribution soon.

     (See January '93 and March '93 Internet Monthly Reports for more
     details about the application and communications services being
     developed.)

CONCERT
-------

     The communications research group at MCNC has taken delivery of a
     Cray Y-MP EL. This entry level system will be used as a development
     system to support the gigabit networking research undertaken by the
     group. Activities expected to involve the Cray Y-MP EL include:
     porting and evaluation of new transport layer protocols to UNICOS
     including optimized versions of XTP, PIP and PIPE; development of a
     prototype HIPPI to ATM gateway with cryptographic capabilities;
     development of direct bus attached ATM interfaces for the Cray Y-
     MP; and development of collaborative environments involving
     scientific computing.

     The communications research group has been experimenting with
     network resource management and packet video. The group's IP/ATM
     network testbed has been expanded to four Sparc10s dually connected
     through an Ethernet and a Fore System ASX-100 ATM switch. The group
     has four prototype video capture boards from Sun and three Parallax
     XVideo cards (with JPEG compression) installed in the workstations.
     Experiments with network resource management and packet video
     continues in this environment.

     A software H.261 codec implementation has been completed. It has
     been tested using XVideo as a frame grabber. It runs at 1.15 frames
     per second between two Sparc10 with CIF size and 4.5 frames per
     second with QCIF size. The codec is used in studying codec-network
     interface issues. A two-level coding option is also being
     implemented.

     DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES

     Directory and Database Services had a workstation in the InterNIC
     booth at InterOp, and we demonstrated our services to booth
     visitors.  Demonstrations centered on the Directory of Directories
     (accessed through WAIS and Gopher) and on our Directory Services.

     Our Directory Services currently use X.500, Netfind, or WHOIS to
     help locate individuals on the NSFNET.  Our X.500 DSA is tied in to
     the PSI White Pages Project and is linked to X.500 servers
     worldwide.  More than one million entries are accessible through
     this system.  The WHOIS server on ds.internic.net checks the
     Registration Services WHOIS, the DISA NIC WHOIS, and our local list
     of individuals who are not network points of contact.  Netfind,
     written by Mike Schwartz at the University of Colorado, uses a seed
     database, DNS, and finger to find users in the Internet.  X.500,
     WHOIS, and Netfind are accessible through Gopher, and X.500 and
     Netfind are accessible via Telnet on our server (log in as x500 or
     netfind, respectively, on ds.internic.net; no password is
     required).

     A reminder - if you would like to help the Internet community find
     a resource that you offer, send mail to admin@ds.internic.net and
     we will send information about listing your resource in the
     Directory of Directories.

     GIGABIT NETWORKING

     Atomic
     ------

     Work on the ATOMIC LAN is proceeding on several fronts.

     Kernel-AC Software Work

     In the current version of the ATOMIC LAN, address resolution is
     performed by a program called the Address Consultant (AC), which
     utilizes a special address family (AF_ATOM) to send link level
     probe packets when it maps the network.  This month we began the
     task of moving the AC from user space into the Sun kernel, where it
     will perform functions analogous to the Ethernet Address Resolution
     Protocol (ARP).  The mapping function that the AC performs is much
     more complicated than ARP.  It is expected that the kernel-based

Internet Monthly Report                                      August 1993


     implementation of the AC will simplify the process of porting the
     Atomic software to other platforms, since it will eliminate the
     need for the AF_ATOM address family.

     Design of 486-based VL-Bus ATOMIC Interface

     We have been continuing our high-level design for a 700Mb/s
     interface for a 486 VL-bus system. We expect a nearly complete
     specification by the end of August. The interface will have DMA
     access by the host system and separate sending and receiving Mosaic
     processors.

     Cable Component Testing

     We have also been continuing work testing the various components of
     a high-speed cable for the ATOMIC LAN. Our goal is to create a
     bidirectional 500Mb/s cable over a 100' length of twisted pair
     (25pr) cable. Specifically we have been testing the differential
     driver chips (ATT 41mm), the Slack-20 v4.0 chips created by Caltech
     and various grades/lengths of twisted pair cable. Our expectation
     is to build a low-cost cable for installation over relatively short
     distances at ISI.  The Slack chip will eventually be replaced by
     the "Dialog" chip that is also designed by Caltech.  The Dialog
     includes flow control and fault tolerance. We are participating in
     Dialog design discussions with Caltech.

     Simulation of the ATOMIC LAN

     We created a simulator for the ATOMIC LAN that allows us to
     evaluate the performance of the 16x16 crossbar switches in our
     network and to examine the impact of various high-level routing
     algorithms in a complex network. The simulator allows us to examine
     much larger topologies than we can currently build in the lab and
     can be used as a tool to aid the installation of a production LAN.
     The simulation results have led us to re-think the routing strategy
     used in the Address Consultant.

     MULTIMEDIA CONFERENCING

     On August 17, an MBONE teleconference meeting of the IETF AVT
     working group was held to review the changes in the "next-to-last
     call" draft specification for the Realtime Transport Protocol and
     reach agreement on several questions.  One item agreed was to seek
     "proposed standard" rather than "experimental" status when the
     draft is submitted to become an RFC.  This should happen in
     September, after the "last call" edition of the draft spec is
     completed to incorporate the changes discussed in the meeting and
     some additional explanatory sections on usage scenarios.

     Our teleconference session orchestration program, mmcc, was
     demonstrated at INET'93 with audio/video calls placed to remote
     locations such as ISI, where the camera gave a nice view of the
     marina.  To avoid requiring an individual to answer the calls, an
     option was added to the call setup process in mmcc to allow an
     automatic yes or no answer when contacted, rather than ringing.

Internet Monthly Report                                      August 1993


     For automatic calls, mmcc can also send a Tcl command to instruct
     PARC's nv program automatically to begin sending video at session
     startup.  This is an example of the kind of cross-application
     communication that will be necessary to fully integrate the tools
     in a teleconferencing suite.  We are converting mmcc to Tk/Tcl to
     facilitate experimentation in this area, and plan to publicly
     release that version of mmcc.

     One function which will require coordination among the tools is the
     selection of the quality of service.  Mmcc has been augmented to
     provide a range of QoS choices to the user in abstract terms and to
     share the initiator's QoS choice with all potential participants.
     It then maps the abstract request to a flow specification and
     requests resource reservations for both senders and receivers via
     the RSVP API.  To aid in testing RSVP, direct control is also
     provided to change the selected flow spec.  Two open questions are:
     how should the high-level QoS abstraction be mapped into a flow
     specification, and which components of the end-system suite should
     perform the mapping and make the reservations.

     At the workshop on Programming Abstractions for Distributed
     Multimedplications held in conjunction with Multimedia '93, Steve
     Casner gave a keynote presentation on "Multimedia Abstractions and
     the Internet" and Eve Schooler gave a presentation as part of a
     panel on "Session Abstractions for Coordination and Control".

     Steve Casner made a presentation on "Session Management for
     Internet Teleconferencing" at the ARPA Networking PI meeting in
     Santa Rosa.

     Beta testing of the Livingston PortMaster network access server by
     selected UM/MichNet personnel at the University of Michigan

     continues.  The purpose of this period for beta test is to evaluate
     the services and performance provided by the PortMaster before
     making it available to the greater community.  The PortMaster is
     expected to provide a superior level of dial-in service, as well as
     PPP and SLIP access.

     The dial-in service offered via the UM/MichNet NAS has been
     configured to be as flexible as possible, at a variety of modem
     speeds and with or without error correction and data compression.
     The UofM machine will be used for PPP access only, with public
     availability to authenticated users upon completion of successful
     testing.

     Common connection establishment procedures have been determined to
     be the principle requirements which must be met by a NAS
     participating in the MichNet pool of ports, as well as the ability
     to interface with an authentication helper interfacing with
     serveral authentication servers.  Michigan State University is
     working with Xylogics, where the Xylogics Annex terminal service
     has been deployed.  State-of-the-art network access will be
     provided to users around the state with the deployment of Network
     Access Servers throughout the MichNet backbone.

     The College of Education at Westerm Michigan University is
     coordinating a project to offer west Michigan school districts
     access to WMU computing resources and the Internet during the
     1993-94 school year. Several districts have expressed an interest
     in this initiative which will support accounts for teachers and
     their students.  Saginaw Valley State University sponsored a
     three-week Summer Research Institute which included use of SVSU's
     Internet connectivity.  Participating in the Institute, was a team
     of four students and two teachers from Bay City Central, a local
     high school, which won an environmental research competition,
     "EarthVision," sponsored by the Environmental Protection Agency.
     The Greater Flint Educational Consortium announced its funding of a
     Modem Pool & Information Server project in Genesee County.  A group
     of modems will be installed for public access via computers, and
     the Information Server will act as a computerized bulletin board
     for the educational community.  Ultimately, students, parents and
     teachers in the area will be able to access computerized events
     calendars, homework listings, library holdings and local college
     admissions requirements.

     Hope College, a MichNet affiliate, upgraded its connectivity to the
     MichNet regional backbone as a 1.5Mbps (T1) link using a cisco
     router.  The new link runs from Hope to the MichNet backbone router
     in Grand Rapids.  Two new MichNet public dial-in access sites,
     Holland and Big Rapids, are available.  The cooperative efforts of

     Ferris State University and Merit cooperatively make access
     possible at the Big Rapids site.

     Introduction to the RIPE NCC
     ----------------------------

     The RIPE NCC

     RIPE (Reseaux IP Europeens) is a collaborative organisation open to
     all European Internet service providers.  The objective of RIPE is
     to ensure the necessary administrative and technical coordination
     to allow the operation of a pan-European IP network.  Much of this
     work is achieved through voluntary effort.  RIPE does not operate a
     network of its own.

     The RIPE Network Coordination Centre (RIPE NCC) is a European
     organisation with a charter to support RIPE.  It is specifically
     focused on undertaking those activities which cannot be effectively
     performed by volunteers from the participating organisations.  As
     such, it provides a wide range of technical and administrative
     support to network operators in the Internet community across
     Europe.  The RIPE NCC currently has 3 permanent staff members. The
     RARE association provides the legal and financial framework for the
     NCC.

     RIPE NCC Activities

     Regional Internet Registry

     In order to operate IP networks in the Internet or between
     organisations each physical network must use a unique IP address.
     Other number spaces like the Autonomous System numbers need also be
     maintained in a way to guarantee uniqueness.  This is the task of
     the Internet Registry.  Before the RIPE NCC existed these tasks
     were performed centrally for the whole Internet under the auspices
     of the US Department of Defense and funded by various US agencies.
     Recently it has been recognised that the fair and hierarchical
     allocation of IP address space is a necessity for the Internet to
     survive.

     To answer this need the RIPE NCC has set up the Regional Internet
     Registry and a network of Local Internet Registries at IP service
     providers for Europe.

     The RIPE NCC has identified and helped to set up more than 60 local
     registries to date.  These local registries serve either the
     customers of a particular service provider or all organisations
     within a country which do not have a service provider.  The latter
     category of registries is called "Non-Service Provider" registry, a
     community service which to date is being provided free of charge.
     So far 22 organisations willing to provide this have established a
     non-service provider registry.

     Most European organisations now have access to a local registry
     which knows the local environment, speaks the local language and
     can provide most registration functions locally.  Only requests for
     large amounts of address space are being reviewed by the NCC.  As a
     result, IP number allocation to European organisations is now
     easier, more timely and last but not least fairer than before.
     Particularly the local support and the increased responsiveness are
     appreciated by network operators.

     To date the European Internet Registry system has allocated more
     than 14,000 network numbers, 800-900 of which are currently being
     routed on the Internet.  This shows that many organisations are
     using the Internet protocols without actually connecting to the
     Internet, at least not initially.  Another clearly visible trend is
     that the vast majority of new address space is assigned for
     purposes other than research and development.

     The RIPE Database

     In many operational situations ranging from loss of connectivity to
     intrusion attempts it is necessary to establish quickly who is
     actually responsible --a specific IP network or DNS domain-- and
     find a way to contact them.

     To answer this need one of the core activities of the NCC is
     maintaining the RIPE Network Management Database often referred to
     just as "RIPE Database".  This database contains information needed
     for the technical coordination of European IP networks.  The RIPE
     database is maintained at the RIPE NCC in cooperation with local
     Internet Registries throughout Europe.  It can be queried from
     anywhere on the Internet using a variety of methods including the
     standard WHOIS service.  Currently decentralised servers for access
     to the database are being set up.

     General Coordination

     Network operators need to coordinate with each other in order to
     maintain the functionality of the European Internet.  RIPE is the
     forum for this coordination and much of it is done at the meetings
     RIPE holds three times a year.  RIPE working groups discuss
     specific problems and produce recommendations.  Between RIPE
     meetings a focus for these activities is needed.

     The NCC supports general RIPE activities by providing a focal point
     for and by fielding many queries.  This activity is not easy to
     describe or quantify.  Nevertheless the NCC plays an important role
     in many RIPE activities just by providing a permanently staffed
     location that keeps track of activities and is able to perform
     small but urgently needed tasks.  In addition the NCC organises the
     RIPE meetings.

     Information Services

     The RIPE NCC maintains the "RIPE document store" which is a
     collection of RIPE`s own documents and information relevant to the
     Internet community in general such as RFC's, FYI's, information on
     the IETF, IEPG and other technical documentation.

     Publicly available software tools which are useful for network
     operators are also made available via the document store.  The
     document store can be accessed with traditional tools such as
     interactive login from the Internet and via X.25 based networks and
     FTP.  It can also be accessed with many of the new resource
     discovery tools such as Archie, Wide Area Information Server
     (WAIS), Gopher and World Wide Web (WWW).

     the RIPE NCC.  The contact address is given below:

UCL
----

     We have now integrated LBL's Class Based Queueing code into a
     streams module that is plumbed between the IP output module and and
     System V compliant DLPI type link level device driver. Access to
     the module to program flow classes is implemented via an ioctl at
     the moement that adds or subtracts fixed bitmap patterns that are
     used in mask and matches on packets to flows.

     A more complex piece of code to provide efficient matching on less
     obvious (less friendly) keys in packets that identify flows is
     being developed alongside this approach.

     Testing across the fatpipe is taking place in september, with the
     seperation of MICE and ARPA Project multimedia and other traffic
     from UCL service traffic, and several (albeit artificial)
     subclasses of traffic.

     Traces of the traffic will be taken to try to demonstrate the
     effectiveness of the scheme. Essentially, deliberate overload
     conditions will be set up, and conditions where multimedia traffic
     threatens the service, and vice versa, and the queueing controls
     turned on and off periodically.

     During August, Kirstein attended Inet 93 and t meet with many
     collaborators stateside.
