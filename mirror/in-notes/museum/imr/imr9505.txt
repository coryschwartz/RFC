     1. The summer IETF meeting will be held in Stockholm, Sweden the
        week of July 17-21, 1995. Due to the meeting costs, the IETF
        attendance fee for the Stockholm meeting will be US$300. Hotel
        information has been sent to the Announcement list, and
        attendees are encouraged to make their plane and hotel
        reservations. Logistic information has already been posted to
        the IETF Announcement list.

        Following Stockholm, the IETF will be meeting in Dallas, Texas
        on December 4-8, 1995. Our local host for this meeting is MCI.
        Once all the arrangements have been made, notifications will be
        sent to the IETF Announcement list. Remember that information
        on future IETF meetings can be always be found in the file
        0mtg-sites.txt which is located on the IETF shadow directories.
        This information can also be viewed from the IETF Home Page on
        the Web. The URL is:

INTERNET PROJECTS

     NIMROD - NEXT GENERATION ROUTING AND ADDRESSING FOR THE INTERNET

     The goal of the Nimrod project is to design, specify, implement and
     test a flexible new routing and addressing architecture suitable
     for very large scale internets. The basic architecture for
     computation of routes will be based on distribution of network
     topology maps, with source-specified route selection, and local
     (i.e. not hop by hop) computation of routes.

     The architecture provides a single homogeneous framework for all
     routing, including both inter-domain and intra-domain.

     During the month of May, we completed the design of the software
     architecture for the prototype implementation of Nimrod.  This
     includes specification of functionality, protocols, software
     modules, service interfaces between modules, and data structures.
     We are nearing completion of the detailed design of the software
     for three of the major protocols for Nimrod: database update,
     database query-response, and path management.  In June, we will
     begin the implementation of the Nimrod software (in C over NetBSD).

     REAL-TIME INFORMATION TRANSFER AND NETWORKING (RITN)

     RITN is the successor program of what used to be called
     "Scalability." Its goal is to provide networking support to very
     large scale distributed interactive simulations (DIS).  BBN is
     presently working cooperatively with ATI, NRaD, NRL, Lincoln Lab
     and Loral Advanced Distributed Simulation (LADS) to implement a
     prototype system for reducing the wide-area traffic load of DIS
     exercises while maintaining their fidelity.  It is called the
     Application Control Techniques (ACT) System, and BBN is designing
     and implementing functions to provide advanced network services in
     support of its traffic reduction and fidelity control objectives.

     During May, we implemented and tested code that will facilitate
     NTP-based time synchronization of all SGI application hosts
     including ModSAF platforms and the simulation loggers.  Calls to
     the system clock were deemed to expensive for ModSAF, and so we

     enabled NTP synchronization of an alternative clock based on the
     SGI's cycle counter and wrote an API for developers wishing to
     access this clock.

     Implementation of bilevel multicast routing and quality of service
     functions got under way, and coordination with other ACT System
     developers on integration issues and MIB definition continued.  For
     bilevel QOS, we imported ISI's latest implementation of the RSVP
     daemon and began porting it to the SGI.

     We completed work on a traffic generator that can output a packet
     flow with packet size and arrival distributions identical to those
     of a previously recorded DIS packet trace.  The output packets can
     be addressed according to a table associating destination addresses
     with simulation entities.  We started work on a companion receiver
     that can be programmed to send IGMP join and leave messages at
     specified times.  These tools will be time-synchronized with each
     other and used to test the bilevel multicast routing services

     Walter Milliken completed a draft report outlining the issues of
     providing IP multicast services for real-time applications in
     internetworks incorporating ATM subnets.  After review by our
     Government sponsor, this will be presented as an ID within the IP-
     over-ATM Working Group.

     INTERNIC DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES

     InterNIC Directory and Database Services has a WWW home page for
     the NIC Locator Database (aka NIC Profiles).  This database is
     hosted by DS for the IETF NISI working group.  The entries point to
     Network Information Centers on the Internet with some snippets of
     information such as services and publications available, contacts,
     hours of operation, primary audience, etc.  The WWW home page may
     be found at:

              http://ds.internic.net/ds/niclocate.html

     All NICs on the Internet are invited to place an entry in this
     database.  The entry template may be found at:

             ftp://ds.internic.net/pub/niclocator.template

     Or - you may submit an entry via the NIC Locator DB home page.
     Entries should be forwarded to scout@ds.internic.net, scal@cts.com,

     For directory services, we started a new X.500 DSA named "Red-Faced
     Tamarin" on one of our secondary machines (ds1.internic.net).

     The main function of this DSA is to act as a slave DSA for the
     top-level entries of X.400 information in the Open Community
     routing tree in the Long Bud project started by the IETF MHS-DS
     working group.  The Long Bud project comprises four DSAs holding
     the top-level entries - two in USA and two in Europe.  The four
     DSA's fully replicate each other's routing tree entries.  All
     nonleaf entries in the routing tree include slaveDSA attributes so
     that pilot participants will be able to find backups when primary
     DSA's are unreachable.

     The new DSA will also provide additional redundancy for our other
     X.500-based services.

     A reminder - if you would like to help the Internet community find
     a resource that you offer, send mail to admin@ds.internic.net and
     we will send information about listing your resource in the
     Directory of Directories.

     INTERNIC REGISTRATION SERVICES

     I.  Significant Events

     InterNIC Registration Services assigned over 9,503 network addresses
     and registered over 13,974 domains.  One top-level country domains
     were registered during May for: Cameroon (CM).

     The suit that Knowledgenet has filed against Network Solutions and
     David L. Boone over the knowledgement.com domain is still pending.
     This case could establish precedence that refutes InterNIC
     Registration Service's current policy of first-come first served by
     binding trademarked names with a domain name.

     Released the new domain template.  It now handles new, update, and
     delete actions through the same template.

Internet Monthly Report                                         May 1995


     During the month of May, domain requests are averaging between 400+
     500+ for new submissions per day. Adjustments continue to be made in
     domain processing.  Additional, staffing is being acquired to
     accommodate the growth in registration requests. At the close of May
     1995, the domain processing queue had decreased from 8,000 to 5,000
     new domain registrations.

     The final draft of the InterNIC policy and procedures guidelines for
     Network numbers was approved by Jon Postel.  Also, the new Internet
     Service Provider (ISP) template was approved.  Both are available
     on-line from RS.INTERNIC.NET.

     II.  Current Status

     During the month of May 1995, InterNIC Registration Services received
     communications as shown below.  The majority of the correspondence
     concerned the assignment and re-assignment of network numbers and the
     registration or change of domain names.

          E-mail     22,954    (hostmaster@internic.net)
          Postal/Fax    299    (primarily IP number requests)
          Phone       4,587

     The Registrations Services host computer supported a large volume
     of information retrieval requests during the month of May.

                     Connections   Retrievals
          Gopher      48,443          46,079

MERIT/NSFNET ENGINEERING
------------------------

     With the successful retirement of the NSFNET Backbone Service,
     Merit's Internet Engineering and Network Management groups now
     focus on the NSF- funded Routing Arbiter (RA) project, charged with
     providing routing coordination for the post-NSFNET network
     infrastructure.  Merit's partners in the RA project are the
     University of Southern California Information Sciences Institute
     (ISI); IBM, as a subcontractor to ISI; and the University of
     Michigan ROC, as a subcontractor to Merit.

     Merit is preparing a history of the NSFNET that will trace the
     growth and influence of the backbone since its beginnings in 1988.
     We are particularly interested in hearing about how the NSFNET
     enhanced the research capabilities of scientists and researchers
     around the country.  If you would like to contribute examples of
     backbone advancements for your work in the sciences or humanities,
     please contact Susan R. Harris (srh@merit.edu).

     Merit reached a milestone at 09:00 EST on Monday, May 8, when the
     venerable Policy Routing Database (PRDB) was turned off and
     replaced by the Routing Arbiter Database (RADB).  The PRDB had been
     used to configure the NSFNET Backbone Service and ANSNET (AS690)
     since 1989.  Under the RADB, the method for submitting new routes
     has changed.  Instead of submitting Network Announcement Change



Cooper                                                         [Page 15]

Internet Monthly Report                                         May 1995


     Requests (NACRs) for human processing, users directly register
     information by sending in RADB "Route objects" for immediate
     inclusion in the database system.  Additions and entries to the new
     registry are made by the home AS that creates the route, rather
     than by a peer AS of AS690.  The RADB is used to configure the
     Routing Arbiter's Route Servers and the ANSNET backbone.

     A new routing tool set, the RAToolSet, is now freely available from
     the Routing Arbiter partnership.  Among the new tools is
     'radbserver,' an enhanced whois server that provides information
     collected from all the registries that form part of the Internet
     Routing Registry (IRR).  The IRR currently includes internetMCI's
     registry and the database maintained by CA*net, in addition to the
     RIPE NCC and Routing Arbiter databases.  These linked registries
     provide information on most of the networks and ASs routed in the
     Internet today.

     The RADB whois server is easy to use.  For example, the following
     command queries the RADB for information about a network with the
     address 193.101.106.0 . (The -h parameter tells the whois client on
     your machine that you want to talk to the whois server supplied by
     the Routing Arbiter service):

         whois -h whois.ra.net 193.101.106.0

     The output comprises two Route objects containing information about
     that network: one Route object from the RIPE NCC's database, and
     one from the RADB.  You can also request information about a
     particular AS:

         whois -h whois.ra.net AS800

     The RADB output comprises two AS objects, one from the RADB and one
     from the CA*net registry.  The following query asks for information
     about the individuals who maintain routing information for AS800:

         whois -h whois.ra.net MAINT-AS800

     The output is an RADB Maintainer object.

     We encourage network operators and providers to register their
     policy in the RADB or one of the other registries in the IRR; this
     will enable other members of the Internet community to obtain a
     consistent view of your routing policy.  For more information about
     registering in the RADB, see
     http://www.ra.net/routing.arbiter/RA/RADB.tools.docs/register.html.

Internet Monthly Report                                         May 1995


     Other tools in the RAToolSet include:

     peval           A policy evaluator that inputs a RIPE-181 policy
                     expression, performs essential background
                     calculations such as symbolic evaluations and
                     expansions, and outputs another RIPE-181 policy
                     expression that is used by other tools, such as
                     RTConfig.

     RTConfig        A router configuration tool that can be used by
                     providers to generate router configs directly
                     from the RADB or other IRR registries.  Currently
                     in production use for the RA Route Servers, ANSNET,
                     and CA*net, RTConfig is a front-end tool that uses
                     peval and radbserver transparently to users.

     Peval and RTConfig are available at
     ftp://ftp.ra.net/routing.arbiter/tools/RAToolSet/.  Peval is
     included in the RTConfig source code.

     Work continues on establishing peering sessions for the RA
     project's Route Servers at the NAPs and other interconnection
     points.  The Route Servers--Sun SPARC 20 workstations installed at
     each connection point-- eliminate the need for pair-wise peering
     among the attached Internet Service Providers (ISPs.)  The Route
     Servers input routing information from each ISP router, create a
     "view" (a Routing Information Base) reflecting that ISP's policy
     requirements, and pass the processed routing information to each
     ISP's router.  The Route Servers thus reduce the number of peering
     sessions each ISP router needs to process from O(n) to O(1).

     Routing information at the interconnection points flows only
     between ISP's routers and the Route Servers; traffic flows only
     between ISP routers.  Route Servers are physically in place at the
     AADS, Sprint, PacBell, MAE-East, and MAE-West interconnection
     points, and are expected to be in full production mode by June 30,
     1995.  Further information about the Route Servers is available
     from the RA home page, cited earlier in this report.

     Merit hosted the fourth North American Network Operators' Group
     (NANOG) meeting in Ann Arbor on May 22-23.  Stan Barber of Academ
     Consulting Services has kindly made available a complete set of
     notes and slides from the meeting.  They will soon be available at

The 20th RIPE Meeting

   The 20th RIPE Meeting was held in January 1995 in Amsterdam, The
   Netherlands.  Approximately 115 people attended.

   Introduction to RIPE

      Due to new members attending the RIPE meetings for the first time,
      Rob Blokzijl and Daniel Karrenberg presented an introduction to
      RIPE and the RIPE NCC (Network Coordination Center).  Rob lead the
      talk describing when the Internet came into Europe on a large
      scale (1987-1988), they wanted to communicate with the U.S.  In
      the 1980's the term "IP" was a dirty word in Europe.  The first
      RIPE meeting that was held had an attendance of 14 people.  It was
      originally called the "European IP Coordinating Committee".  Rob
      stated that the attendance at this meeting will be over 100.

      This group invented a name (RIPE - Reseaux IP Europeens) and
      worked out a terms of reference (charter) in 1989, which explained
      what RIPE is, what it does, and what it doesn't do:

      - RIPE operates as an exchange mechanism with IP technology
      - The area of operations is Europe (this term is used loosely -
        in this context it includes Algeria, Israel, East Europe, etc.)
      - Whoever operates wide area networks are encouraged to
        participate
      - RIPE is not organized by country, but by widescale organizations
      - Promotes and coordinates IP networks
      - RIPE is not a network service provider
      - RIPE serves as the forum for a focal point for other common
        activities of the participants related to IP networking
      - It is open and equal, like the Internet
      - All documents are published openly
      - RIPE establishes agreement on common network management

   How is RIPE organized in practice?

      - meets three times a year
      - working groups, plenary sessions
      - the plenary agenda includes reports of action items, reports
        on the RIPE NCC, financial reports, etc.
      - InterNIC/APNIC Reports
      - TERENA Report
      - IETF Report
      - IPv6 report from the European perspective

      Rob stated to the attendees that the Internet is like a great
      ocean.  It is huge.  No one owns it.

      Rob stated that RIPE has no formal membership.  If you come to a
      RIPE meeting, you are member.

   The NIDUS Working Group Meeting - Nandor Hovarth

   GARR Report - A. Blasco Bonito

      The Network Resources Project is still going on since the last
      GARR Report at the RIPE meetings in Lisbon last September.  The
      project is partially completed.  A modified WAIS server has been
      created.  About 60% of the academic community in Italy is now in
      the map. The largest problem so far is keeping the maps up to
      date.  So far, this project has completed the following:

      1) X.500 Directory - includes all information of Italian
         organizations and people.
      2) In parallel with the WHOIS database, with RIPE technology.
      3) Modified WAIS server from the technical point of view.  The
         user has all the information they need to find resources.
      4) The problem is gathering the resources correctly and ALL the
         information, not just pieces of information.
      5) A template has been created to be filled out.  They have
         established a Network Information Retrieval group in Italy,
         which is gathering up the information.
      6) Tools are in place and are able to collect the information.

      There was a question from one attendee on what the percentage of
      available resources are registered?  The answer was 60-75% of the
      information in the academic world has been registered.  In the
      commercial world it is not yet known.  The information collected
      is just about Italy, not other countries.  Another attendee asked
      if it was possible to install a map via the World Wide Web
      automatically.  The reply was that is certainly be possible, but
      that the software to do this isn't quite there yet.  Additional
      information can be found at: wais://wais.nis.garr.it.

   TERENA - Frode Greisen

   TERENA = A RARE+EARNINFO Merger

      TERENA is one national network organization per country, but not
      limited to Europe.  Though, it is Europe oriented.  The associate
      membership includes the International Treaty Organization (ITO).
      TERENA is investigating if it would be possible to allow for
      associate members, which is for organizations who are interested
      in TERENA, and for international members, for example inter-
      governmental organizations like the UN.  There is a General
      Assembly, which is the Executive Committee, and three Vice-

      Presidents.  There is a Technical Committee which decides about
      new projects.  Rob Blokzijl, as RIPE Chair, is now a member of
      this committee, but this may change if RIPE intends to
      incorporate.

      The reason for the merger was less overhead, more volunteers, less
      paid staff, and to provide a glue for international networking.
      The working groups originally in RARE will still be in existence,
      but central funding will not be available as in the earlier days.
      Today, volunteers will do the work.  There was a call for
      proposals last fall.  Fifty proposals were submitted, and are
      currently under review.

   Connectivity WG - Milan Sterba

      There were many new countries represented at this RIPE meeting.
      So, Milan opened the session by explaining what the RIPE
      Connectivity WG is about.  It is interested in new countries
      starting out in the Internet, and connectivity in general, also.
      There are big differences in hostcounts in each country.  Some
      have more than one host per 1,000 people, other less than one host
      per 1,000 people.  National reports are requested at these
      sessions so that attendees can be informed of what's new in
      international connectivity, new services, problems, territorial
      coverage progress, international coverage progress, and related
      projects.

   National Reports:

      Albania: no representative

      Baltic Countries: no representative

      Bulgaria: no representative

      Crotia: no representative

      Czech Republic:
      There are two international lines, 512kbs from Praha to Amsterdam
      and 128kbs from Praha to Vienna.  The Vienna line will be updated
      to 256kbs.  There are 128kbs and 64kbs national lines connecting
      Liberec, Ostrava, Olomouc, Brno, Plzen and Ceske Budejovice.
      Service providers in the Czech Republic currently include CESnet,
      COnet, and EUnet CZ.  They do not have an official agreement
      between them, but exchange traffic.  A new item since the last
      report is that the Prague academic MAN now runs on an ATM backbone
      on six sites.

      Egypt: no representative

      Estonia: no representative

      Faroe Island: NORDUNET connection

      Hungary:
      Business as usual.  The two Vienna lines, which are 64kbs from
      Budapest to Vienna, will be replaced by one 256kbs line.  There is
      a Europanet connection which is one line to Prague.  This hasn't
      changed since the last RIPE meeting.

      Jordan:
      There is a NETS company that provide services to the Internet.  It
      has been operational since October 1994, with about 120 customers.
      There are only analog circuits available.  The situation is
      similar to Lebanon.  $15,000 for an analog circuit.  It is hard to
      start a service provider business in Jordan.  There are also
      technical problems.

      Lebanon:
      Lebanon is just coming out of a twenty year war.  They do not have
      any domestic communication infrastructure.  There is a satellite
      link provided by LIBANPAC (France Telecom/Italian Cable), X.25,
      satellite and marine cable.  The X.25 network is very expensive,
      and there are strict rules and regulations about running it
      outside of the country.  Currently, it is tough dealing with the
      Lebanese on the concept of the Internet.  Internally, they are not
      allowed to provide services to users or other countries.  Charges
      are expensive to the outside world and it is not feasible to start
      an Internet service provider business.  There is also not much
      technical expertise in this environment at this point in time.

      Liechtenstein:
      There is a new connection now that EUnet is managing it (email
      only).

      Macedonia:
      Has email connectivity provided by Slovania.

      Malta:
      Email connectivity only at this point in time.

      Morocco:
      A new country with email connectivity only to their School of
      Engineering via EUnet.

      Poland:

      The 9.6kbs line from Minsk is one host now.  The line from Warsaw
      now goes to Stockholm via 2Mb (satellite NORDUNET and UNISOURCE).
      A question came up if pictures are available.  Yes, via URL:
      http://www.nask.org.pl/NASK/ripe-info.html.  The NASK box is a
      Polish box in Stockholm that operates two lines.  Another question
      was what are Poland's plan with routing issues?  Poland has had
      problems in the past, but now they are routing EBONE via Stockholm
      and the problem has been solved.

      Romania:
      There are two 9.6kbs lines, one from Bucharest to Vienna, which
      will be replaced by a 64kbs satellite, and the other from
      Bucharest to the EMPB/Europanet.  All links are loaded at present
      with about 2 1/2 gigabytes per month.  This is the academic
      network.  For commercial providers, they have a different
      international link.

      Russia:
      There are different points of view in state problems with the
      Internet in Russia.  The situation in Russia is that the academic
      community relies on both commercial (Relcom, IASnet) and academic
      providers (Moscow State University/DFN), Russian Space Science
      Agency, Freenet (represents Russia in TERENA))

      Building a large academic network for all is a large state program
      task.  The RELARN (Russia Electronic Academic Research Network)
      project has been started up, with two goals:

      - better connectivity
      - better services through regional, commercial nets

      This task of providing services to all the scientific community by
      means of all networks which work correctly is difficult with cost
      sharing of the backbone.  There has been a lot of experience in
      technical work.  Part of the backbone development of this project
      is under the guidance of the Soros Foundation, the other part of
      the development is a planned state project.

      The end-user support of the original network used to be provided
      by Relcom.  The Ministry of Science understands the implications
      of supporting the Internet in Russia, but the budget support is
      poor now, and not very optimistic for the future.

      In the local regions of Russia, there is a poor information
      infrastructure.  Moscow is now the most expensive city in the
      world.  The concept is to create regional NAPs (St. Petersburg,
      Moscow, Ekaterinburg, Novosibirsk, Chabarovsk) and a backbone
      network to interconnect them. Users connect to the net through

Internet Monthly Report                                         May 1995


      regional providers, connected to the NAPs.  Also, to start using
      ex-military satellites, and other communication satellites.

      The major digital information infrastructure communication players
      in the IP market include SovAm, GTS (Global Telecommunication
      Systems), Sprint Group, Relcom, and RUNNET (Russia University
      Net).  They all have important plans to implement national
      backbones over higher-speed satellite links.  They have been
      encouraged to:

      1) establish relationships and connectivity within Moscow
      2) proceed jointly in setting up national satellite overlay
      3) jointly participate in the CIX international.

      There are plans to establish digital links to 15 cities this year.
      The Sprint Group intends to build satellites and expand IP
      services, and provide digital links with IP for the Internet for
      large cities of Russia by the end of this year.  There have been
      requests received for IP connection from Africa (Central and
      South), and Asia to connect to the Internet via Russia.

      There is a Russia/European problem of a "dead area", concerning
      the links through Scandinavia.  There is a need for communication
      with Europe and the West.  This also is in need of funding.  GTS
      provides $300 million, and Sprint provides $100 million.
      Currently, Relcom and Sprint are the core of the Russia commercial
      activity.

   RIPE General Plenary

      Rob Blokzijl lead the review and approval of the agenda and
      minutes of the last meeting.

   IETF Report

      Joyce Reynolds presented an Internet Engineering Task Force report
      from the San Jose IETF, held in November 1994.  (See Appendix A.)
      This report updated the RIPE attendees on the current "hot" topics
      the IETF is focusing on and updated progress.  This included IPng,
      security matters, etc.

   The User Services Area of the IETF Report

      A report was given to the RIPE plenary attendees by Joyce Reynolds
      about the state and status of the User Services Area of the IETF.
      (See Appendix B.)  This item was originally on the NIDUS working
      group agenda.  It was decided by Rob Blokzijl that this
      presentation should be rescheduled to take place at the plenary
      session.

   RIPE NCC Report - Daniel Karrenberg

      See also, "Introduction to RIPE" section.

      Daniel Karrenberg presented the RIPE NCC Report.  There are 148
      local registries as of 24 January 1995.  Daniel stated that the
      growth in the number of registries is like the DNS hostcount
      growth - it is almost out of control, but it is improving slowing.
      The relationship between the number of DNS hosts and the parallel
      growth of the number of registries has not changed.  It is
      predicted that there will approximately 240 registries by the end
      of this year. The new provider registries continue to require more
      support and guidance from the NCC than those having a long
      Internet history.  It is close to getting out of hand, but new
      registries do provide more income for the NCC.

      Registry workload growth continues to be overwhelming.  The
      hostmaster alone receiveds at least 37 messages a day,  and the
      <ncc@ripe.net> mailbox receives 41 messages a day.  More than 50%
      of these messages are routine questions, and this is resulting in
      staff burnout.  Daniel is a bit more optimistic about the NCC work
      load situation then when last reported at the RIPE meeting in
      Lisbon.  There is still a backlog in the hostmaster queue, but
      there are some signs of improvement.

Internet Monthly Report                                         May 1995


      There are now five personnel available (seven are planned for
      1995).  However, Marten Terpstra is leaving the NCC after the
      PRIDE project has been finished, and Tony Bates left recently,
      also.  The FTEs (Full Time Equivalents) that are actually needed
      for the NCC is still lagging behind the workload.  It is still not
      possible to do everything that should be done according the RIPE
      NCC Activity Plan.

      For the coming period it is planned to develop training and
      documentation for new registries. Furthermore, a ticketing system
      will be introduced to keep better track of the larger number of
      requests the NCC expects.  The billing procedures will be
      streamlined to make less errors and to keep up with the larger
      number of registries and also a new charging model for 1996 should
      be developed. The Quarterly reports which have been delayred will
      be restarted in a new revised format. The most important task is
      to keep up with the growth.

   RIPE Financial Report Progress

      Daniel presented the RIPE NCC financial report. There was no
      agreement reached on a funding model for 1995, despite several
      efforts by TERENA and the NCC.  However, consensus was reached
      that the 1996 funding model should be more usage based and the NCC
      committed to develop alternatives by mid-1995.

      A conservative budget of ECU 407,500, compared to the ECU 245,000
      of 1994 was presented and discussed.  As of 23rd January, the
      revenue showed that 70% of the budget was confirmed informally
      (via EMail or Phone), but 20% was actually secured by getting a
      formal commitment.  On 1st February, the RIPE NCC will process
      requests from contributing registries before those from non-
      contributing registries and individuals.  This is in fairness to
      those contributing to the costs of the service.  More information
      regarding the new charging scheme can be found in: URL:

   Policy Based Routing Implementation and Deployment in Europe
   (PRIDE) - Marten Terpstra

      Marten Terpstra presented the final report of the PRIDE project.
      The PRIDE project ended in October 1994.  The main objectives of
      the PRIDE project were to provide tools that make use of a Routing
      Registry, to provide information about the routing registries, and
      to coordinate with other routing registries.  The PRIDE tools were
      released in two stages.  Most of the tools are ready to use now,
      although "prconn" and "prconfig" are not finished due to changing
      requirements (CIDR) and time constraints.  For more information

      see: ftp://ftp.ripe.net/pride/tools/pride.tools.ps.tar.Z

      Information about the routing registries was provided by the PRIDE
      guide which gives information about how to register in a routing
      database and how to use the information in the database.  The
      guide is available at: ftp.ripe.net/pride/docs/guide-1.0.ps.tar.Z.
      Training was provided for internet service providers, which
      focussed on the use of the tools and the Guide. The courses were
      considered useful.

      PRIDE's second guide was dependent upon RIPE-81++ developments.
      There has been a large amount of effort put into the development
      of RIPE-81++.  As part of this coordination effort, the RIPE-181
      document is now generally accepted as "de facto" Routing registry
      standard.  Many people are now using ripe-181 and the ripe
      database software.  Many other routing registry projects were
      started in various places.  The PRIDE project team tried to keep
      close contact to these groups and to try to develop one standard.

               IPng Area - Comments on IPv4 Addressing

     - Changes in address assignment policies are not recommended.
     - Reclamation of underutilized assigned addresses is not
       currently recommended.
     - Efforts to renumber significant portions of the Internet is
       not currently recommended.
     - Recommend consideration of assigning CIDR-type address blocks
       out of unassigned Class A addresses.


               IPng Area - Addressing Plan

- hotly discussed issue
- four basic views:
        - 8 bytes is enough, more is inefficient
        - 16 bytes is about right, 8 is not enough
        - use 20 byte NSAPs, provide global
          harmonization
        - variable length gives best safety and efficiency
- many detailed arguments
- consensus is that expansion to 16 byte
  address space is enough


               IPng Area-Autoconfiguration

     - Transparent address (plug & play)
     - Security considerations
     - Formation of an Address Autoconfiguration WG
       (addrconf) to focus on the allocation of dynamic addresses
       to IPng hosts.


                      IPng Area - Security

Recommendations:

     - Support for the Authorization Header be required.
     - Support for a specific authentication algorithm be
       required.
     - Support for the Privacy Header be required.
     - Support for a specific privacy algorithm be required.
     - "IPng Framework for Firewalls" be developed.

                   IPng Co-Area Directors'
           Thoughts on the European Perspective

Security:

- Security requirements should not be hindered by patent
  rights in Europe (or elsewhere).
- Interested in encouraging European
  activism in deploying secure IPng.
- Comparable to European Unix Crypto
  Algorithm Competition.


                   IPng Co-Area Directors'
           Thoughts on the European Perspective

Address Architecture:

- Modified for Europe due to widely
  accepted provider-based addressing.
- Geography/Provider match may change.
- Set a context for provider planning now.


                IPng Transition - Proposed WGs

                        IPng Transition

        Chairs: Ross Callon, Steve Deering
        Document Editor: Bob Hinden

              Goals:
                Resolve any remaining issues.
                Cooperate with work in other
                areas impacted by IPng.

                        AUTOCONF
              Chairs: Sue Thomson and Dave Katz

      Goals:
        short term Working Group
        focus on documents for server-less
        and stateless-server modes of address
        autoconfiguration
        DHCP done in DHCP WG
        coordinate with other IETF activities

        affected by autoconfiguration such as CNS (for
        autoregistration) and CAT (for authentication)


                IPng Transition - Proposed WGs

Two IPng transition efforts:

short term - refine IPng-specific documents for proposed standard
long term - transition, coexistence and testing
work together

                        NGTRANS
                Chair: Bob Gilligan

      Goals:
        short term Working Group
        focus on IPng transition and coexistence work with
        TACIT WG
        finalize IPng transition overview
        develop documents relating directly to the
        IPng transition

                        TACIT
                Chairs: TBA

      Goals:
        long term Working Group
        learn from other transition and
        deployment efforts
        detail problem areas in transition and
        coexistence
        facilitate transition plans from other
        network technologies (e.g., IPX, CLNP)


                IPng Transition - Proposed WGs
                        TACIT

      Goals (Continued):
        recommendation of specific testing
        procedures
        recommendation of coexistence

        recommendations for the smoothing of
        decentralized transition planning

                           NOSI
                Chair: Brian Carpenter

     Items to pursue:
        RFC 1006bis (ISO transport over TCP,
        small modifications to existing RFC)
        Classic CLNP over IPng tunnels
        (NextHeader = CLNP; probably no
        new document needed, at most a very
        short RFC)
        TP4 over IPng (requires some real work, volunteer
        needed)


                        IPng Reviewer

Appointment of an IPng reviewer specifically responsible for ensuring
that a consistent view of IPng is maintained across related WGs.
Needed since IPng related work will be going on in a number of IETF
areas.

Job is long term, offering broadest perspective.  Must be able to
question, connect all the efforts, spot gaps and misunderstandings,
but not making architectural decisions.
