INTERNET MONTHLY REPORTS
------------------------

The purpose of these reports is to communicate to the Internet Research
Group the accomplishments, milestones reached, or problems discovered by
the participating organizations.

Each organization is expected to submit a 1/2 page report on the first
business day of the month describing the previous month's activities.
These reports should be submitted via network mail to "IMR-ED@ISI.EDU".

The Internet Monthly Report list is now managed by MajorDomo at ISI.EDU.
The announcements of new issues on the Internet Monthly Report are sent
to the IETF-Announce list and to this IMR list.

Requests to be added or deleted from the Internet Monthly report list
should be sent to "majordomo@isi.edu" with the message body either
"subscribe imr" or "unsubscribe imr".

Details on obtaining the current IMR, or back issues, via FTP or EMAIL
may be obtained by sending an EMAIL message to "rfc-info@ISI.EDU" with
the message body "help: ways_to_get_imrs".  For example:

        To: rfc-info@ISI.EDU
        Subject: getting imrs

     IETF Monthly Report for March, 1996


     1. The IETF met in Los Angeles, California from March 4-8, 1996,
        another meeting with over 1,000 attendees. The terminal room
        facilities were provided by Softbank/Interop.

        The next IETF meeting will be in Montreal, Quebec, Canada from
        June 24-28, 1996. If this date looks familiar, it is the same
        date as INET '96! This is not a "joint" meeting per se, but both
        meetings will be held in the Montreal Convention Center. Closing
        out the year, the IETF will be returning to San Jose, California
        on December 9-13, 1996. Following that, the IETF travels to
        Memphis, Tennessee where Federal Express will be the host. This
        meeting will be held April 7-11, 1997.

        Once all the arrangements have been made, notifications will be
        sent to the IETF Announcement list. Remember that information
        on future IETF meetings can be always be found in the file
        0mtg-sites.txt which is located on the IETF shadow directories.
        This information can also be viewed from the IETF Home Page on
        the Web. The URL is:

                     http://www.ietf.cnri.reston.va.us


     2. The minutes of the IESG teleconferences have been publicly
        available on the IETF Shadow directories since 1991. These
        files are placed in the /ftp/iesg directory.

        The following IESG minutes have been added:

           February 22, 1996 (iesg.96-02-22)

     REGISTRATION SERVICES

     Progress Report for February 1, 1966 through February 29, 1996

     I.  Significant Events

     During February 1996, InterNIC Registration Services assigned the
     following network addresses, and registered domain names to include
     top-level country domains:

                                Assigned    Registered   Country Domain
     Network Addresses            5,316
     Domain Names Registered                  34,933
     Top-level Country Domain(s)                   3     SY - Syria
                                                         AW - Aruba
                                                         KH - Cambodia

     The following is to correct information that was stated incorrectly
     on the January 1996 Report.

                                Assigned    Registered   Country Domain
     Network Addresses            5,706
     Domain Names Registered                  31,766


     Installed the new asnreg application.  Made semantic changes in the
     ureg application and initiated beta test.

     The 60-Day Notice program related to Domain Name renewals ran
     successfully. Data was entered into the Access database for
     payments received through February 5.

Internet Monthly Report                                       March 1996


     Trained additional staff in help desk telephone support as a means
     of attacking the backlog in the Domain Names Registration and
     Billing areas.

     Implemented a modified work schedule involving early and late
     shifts and 4 days by 10 hour shifts to allow for increased work
     space for help desk and template processing support.

     Proposed enhancements to the autoreg and domreg applications that
     could result in about a 10% increase in automatic processing (10%
     reduction in manual processing); the required coding is in progress
     by Engineering.

     Siemens Rolm provided ACD equipment/software training to Debbie
     Fuller, Carol Bowles and Nancy Krakover with a focus on automated
     production of reports.

     Completed draft of first NIC Liaison newsletter.

     Mark Kosters, Tom Newell and Kim Hubbard participated on a panel at
     a Commercial Internet eXchange (CIX) sponsored meeting regarding
     the next generation of the InterNIC.  Mark Kosters, Tom Newell, and
     Kim Hubbard attended the North American Network Operators Group
     (NANOG) meeting in San Diego.

     Completed and posted the Lame Delegation Policy revision for
     community review.

     During February, new domain requests averaged 2,000 a day while
     updates averaged 1,000.  Applications that do not need human review
     are processed within a day.  Approximately 75% of the new
     applications and 60% of the updates are handled in this manner.
     The remaining applications and questions enter a queue for
     resolution by one of the processing staff.  This queue length
     averaged 2 weeks during February.  Temporary staff, initially added
     to handle routine phone calls, were trained to process application
     forms.

     II.  Current Status

     During the month of February 1996, InterNIC Registration Services
     received communications as shown below.  The majority of the
     correspondence concerned domain billing. Other correspondences
     include the assignment and re-assignment of network numbers and the
     registration or change of domain names.

          E-mail     75,594     (hostmaster@internic.net)
          Postal/Fax    636    (primarily Billing requests)

                                                    PF - French Polynesia

     A new Automated Call Distributor (ACD) printer was received and
     installed. The draft phone script was shortened to avoid
     overloading the voice mail system until additional voice mail ports
     are installed.

     Data was entered into the Access database for payments received
     through February 21.

     Initiated requisition for renewal of T1 service from BBN Planet.

     Defined short-term requirements for additional T1 service.

Internet Monthly Report                                       March 1996


     Added changes to RWhois spec version 1.1 for non-hierarchical
     indication in the schema definition.

     Fixed a bug in the RWhois client.

     Increased Autoreg processing speed -it will process all daily
     receipts in less than a day.

     Mark Kosters, Jasdip Singh, Tom Newell, Julie Robichaux, and Kim
     Hubbard attended the IETF meeting.

     The IP allocation draft was accepted in the CIDRD Working Group to
     become a BCP/RFC.  Mark Kosters and Kim Hubbard traveled to Canada
     to meet with CAnet to discuss the InterNIC temporarily taking over
     processing of IP numbers.

     The Lame Delegation policy was submitted to SAIC legal staff for
     review.

     Improvements were made in the domreg application. The process of
     implementing the Guardian schema was initiated.

     Selected the top vendor (MCI) for additional T1 service.

     During March, new domain requests continued to range between 1,000
     and 2,000 per day.  Updates ranged from 400 to 600+ a day.
     Applications that do not need human review are processed within a
     day. Approximately 75% are handled in this manner.  The remaining
     applications and questions enter a queue for resolution by one of
     the processing staff. This queue is currently a week and a half
     long.

     INTERNIC DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES

     In February, we started porting our production servers to Solaris.
     The port of one backup server (ds1.internic.net) was started in
     February and completed in early March.  The port of our primary
     server (ds0.internic.net) was started in late March and should be
     complete by the time this version of the IMR comes out.

     Our primary server runs some management applications that do not
     run on all three servers, and it is also our primary mail machine,
     so the port is a bit more complicated than ds1.  We expect to port
     the second backup machine (ds2.internic.net) before the end of
     April.

     As noted previously, testing and rebuilds of databases mean that
     each machine is down for an extended period when it is converted.
     The other two servers support all of our user applications, so
     service should always be available.

     To avoid problems, users should connect to ds.internic.net so they
     will reach one of the servers that is still up.  If users connect
     to a specific server, either by name (i.e. ds1.internic.net instead
     of the general ds.internic.net) or by specific address, they will
     see outages.  Users may also see problems if they have bookmarks or
     other saved pointers to a specific machine.

     A reminder - if you would like to help the Internet community find
     a resource that you offer, send mail to admin@ds.internic.net and

     THE US DOMAIN REGISTRY

     The US Domain Registry has installed a client/server Rwhois
     protocol to support the US Domain WHOIS information.  We register
     third level delegations.  For example, K12.IL.US, TACOMA.WA.US, or
     STATE.MN.US would have entries in the US WHOIS database. To look up
     a US domain name, do the following:

             whois -h nii.isi.edu <domain-name>

     We request all third level subdomain administrators of the US
     Domain to operate a RWHOIS server for those subdomains under them.

     See http://www.isi.edu/us-domain/RWhois Sources and Information for
     more information.

     For further information about the US Domain, send a message to:
