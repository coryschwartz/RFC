                  IETF MONTHLY REPORT for November, 1993

     1. The 28th meeting of the IETF was held in Houston, Texas the
        first week of November, and was very well attended by over 635
        registered attendees. The final numbers are not in yet, but it
        appears that the Houston meeting will be in the top three based
        on attendance. This meeting was hosted by the folks at SESQUINET
        and Rice University.

        At the open plenary on Thursday, there was a consensus that
        beginning with the Seattle IETF meeting, the IETF Secretariat
        will be publishing the proceedings electronically. Details on
        this will be provided, but are still being worked out by the
        Secretariat.


     2. The next meeting of the IETF will be held in Seattle, Washington
        from March 29 (registration reception on the 28th) through April
        1, 1994. This meeting is being hosted by NorthWestNet. Following
        the March 1994 meeting, the IETF will be in Toronto Canada from
        July 25-29 with the registration reception being held on Sunday,
        July 24.

        It looks like the IETF will be in the San Francisco Bay Area in
        the fall... no dates have been set, but the meeting will
        probably be in the first two weeks of November. Once the final
        arrangements have been made, the normal notifications will be
        sent to the IETF Announcement list.

        Remember that information on future IETF meetings can be always
        be found in the file 0mtg-sites.txt which is located on the IETF
        shadow directories.


     3. The IESG approved or recommended the following seven Protocol
        Actions during the month of November, 1993:

        o  Guidelines for Running OSPF Over Frame Relay Networks be
           published as an Informational RFC.

        o  Use of ISO CLNP in TUBA Environments be published as an
           Experimental Protocol.

INTERNET PROJECTS
-----------------

ANSNET/NSFNET BACKBONE ENGINEERING
----------------------------------

     Network Status Summary
     ======================

     Four out of six steps comprising the T3 network upgrade (Phase-5)
     have been completed.  The remaining two steps required to finish
     the T3 hardware upgrade to the ANSnet will be completed in
     December.

     New Rcp_routed software was released on the T3 network to address
     performance improvements.  Gated software including support for
     BGP4 was released to Cornell for a future public release.  ANSnet
     test routers are peering with other networks on the BGP4 public
     test network.

     October Backbone Traffic and Routing Statistics
     ===============================================

     The total inbound packet count for the T3 network (measured using
     SNMP interface counters) was 44,687,182,575 on T3 ENSS interfaces,
     up 2.3% from October.  The total packet count into the network
     including all ENSS serial interfaces was 52,859,569,704 up 3.5%
     from October.  The maximum number of destinations announced to the
     T3 network during November was 13,886.

     T3 Network Upgrade Progress/Status
     ==================================

     During November (and the first week in December) we successfully
     completed four of the six steps that comprise a major upgrade to
     the T3 network (called "Phase-5 upgrade").  The major changes that
     will result from this upgrade are:

     o     Upgrade of all DS3/HSSI router serial interface adapters (T3
           CNSS and ENSS) to support full DS3 bandwidth.  The router
           adapter bus interface cards will also be upgraded to double
           the packet switching rates per interface.

     o     The architecture for interconnection among CNSS routers at
           each MCI POP location will be upgraded from point-to-point
           links to a common FDDI ring.

Internet Monthly Report                                    November 1993


     o     The T3 DSUs on each DS3 interface will be replaced with a T3
           bandwidth manager (T3Plus BMX45) to accommodate each T3
           CNSS-CNSS circuit, and a Larscom Access-T45 DSU on each end
           of a T3 ENSS-CNSS circuit.

     o     New system software and microcode has been installed to
           support the increased adapter performance.  Routing software
           has already been deployed to support the new CNSS
           architecture.

     With the completion of 4 of the 6 deployment steps so far, we now
     have 10 backbone T3 links and 13 customer attachments running at
     full T3:

           Seattle - Denver Backbone Link
           Seattle - San Francisco Backbone Link
           San Francisco - Chicago Backbone Link
           San Francisco - Los Angeles Backbone Link
           Los-Angeles - Albuquerque Backbone Link
           Albuquerque - Houston Backbone Link
           Houston - Atlanta Backbone Link
           Atlanta - Greensboro Backbone Link
           Houston - St. Louis Backbone Link
           St. Louis - Chicago Backbone Link

           ENSS129 at Champaign (UIUC, CICnet)
           ENSS130 at Argonne (Argonne National Lab, CICNet)
           ENSS135 at San Diego (CERFnet, SDSC, etc.)
           ENSS138 at Atlanta (Georgia Tech, SURAnet)
           ENSS139 at Houston (Sesquinet, Rice University)
           ENSS140 at Lincoln (MIDnet, Westnet, etc.)
           ENSS141 at Boulder (Westnet, NCAR, U of Colorado, etc.)
           ENSS142 at Salt Lake City (WestNet, U of Utah, etc.)
           ENSS143 at Seattle (NorthWestNet, U of Washington, etc.)

           ENSS172 at Albuquerque (Phillips Laboratory)
           ENSS179 at Albuquerque (Sandia National Labs)

     Additionally, ENSS200 provided full T3 connectivity to the
     Supercomputing '93 conference in Portland and the Radiological
     Society of North America (RSNA) conference in Chicago during
     November.  The remaining steps are scheduled for December 11th and
     18th, at which point the Phase 5 upgrade will have been completed:

     Rcp_routed Routing Software Changes
     ===================================

     Rcp_routed maintenance releases were deployed in November.  Early
     in November, the "Improved Efficiency" version was released.  A few
     subsequent performance enhancements have been deployed on ENSS144,
     ENSS145, and ENSS136 to address specific problems.  A memory leak
     has recently been identified and a fix will be deployed in early
     December.  Release notes are available for anonymous ftp at:
     ftp.ans.net:/pub/info/t3-rcp_routed/Release-Notes. Recent changes
     have been made to address the effects of high levels of external
     route flap, both the effects on ANSnet and the effects on ANSnet
     peer networks.

     Routing Stability Measured on the T3 Network
     ============================================

     Internal routing stability measurements are made by monitoring
     short term disconnect times (disconnects of five minutes duration
     or less).  This is intended as a measure of stability rather than
     complete connectivity.  November stability dropped to levels
     observed in July and August due to problems with rcp_routed.

     The primary causes of instability during November were problems
     with rcp_routed, and equipment problems associated with new
     equipment deployed as part of the phase5 deployment.  ENSS136 saw
     almost 7 hours of instability mostly due to paging on the router as
     a result of a memory leak.  ENSS144 saw 2-1/2 hours of instability
     due to inefficiency associated with building EGP packets of over
     30KB for numerous EGP peer routers.  E143 experienced just over 2
     hour of instability due to equipment problems associated with the
     phase5 hardware deployment.  Other nodes experienced 30-90 minutes
     of instability due to phase5 deployment.  A few nodes continued to
     have local power problems.

     The number of nodes experiencing more than 30 minutes accumulated
     has been significantly reduced.  The vast majority of nodes had
     less than 15 minutes of accumulated instability over the course of
     the month.  The breakdown by sites is as follows (these figures
     include instabilities recorded during configuration runs):

        MONTH    >5 hr   >2 hr   > 1hr  >30 min   >15 min  <= 15min

     There has been steady increase in the external route flap over the
     course of the year.  The measurement method is described in:

     The number of times networks are announced as unreachable is
     collected.  The following represents the monthly totals in terms of
     number of networks declared unreachable per hour.

     Recent changes to rcp_routed have been designed to dampen route
     flap by deferring sending BGP updates slightly.  This also more
     effectively packs routes into BGP updates.  This work will be
     transferred to into Gated.  A document, soon to be submitted as an

     Gated BGP4/CIDR Deployment Update
     =================================

     During November, ANS connected to the public BGP4 testnet and
     established external long-distance (non-tunneled) peer sessions
     with Cisco peers in Sweden and Alternet.  We also are peering with
     unix/Gated routers at Cornell and on the ANS internal testnet.  We
     are importing full routes, and exporting all AS690 routes to the
     public testnet in addition to our own internal testing.

     Our current plan is to deploy Gated BGP4 code on AS1133 routers
     (Ebone link between GIX and Geneva) by 15-December or sooner, and

     AS690 (ANSnet/NSFnet) routers by 15-January.  We have released the
     current snapshot of the BGP4 Gated code to Cornell and expect there
     will eventually be a public alpha release of BGP4/Gated code from
     them.  We are working with Merit to gather information, and develop
     CIDR-era routing plans for NSFnet peer networks.

     Notable Outages in November '93

     E138 (Atlanta) lost T3 connectivity due to circuit problems on
     11/15

     E136 (College Park) and E145 (Fix-East) suffered extended outages
     due to power failure on 11/16

     E135 (San Diego) suffered an extended outage due to site power
     maintenance on 11/21

     Scalability (September to November 1993)
     ----------------------------------------

     In September, BBN began a new Scalability effort that employs the
     toolset built during previous months.

     Under its Defense Simulation Internet (DSI) Engineering contract
     from ARPA (ASTO), BBN is tasked to study the issue of "scalability"
     from the perspective of network performance and functionality.  The
     Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) user community has
     ambitious goals for dramatically increasing the scale of simulated
     war-fighting exercises.  While the largest exercises to date have
     involved less than 1000 "entities" (tanks, planes, ships, etc.),
     planned future exercises may involve as many as 100,000.  Changes



Cooper                                                         [Page 12]

Internet Monthly Report                                    November 1993


     to both the DIS applications and the supporting network(s) will be
     necessary to accommodate this growth.

     Furthermore, application changes under consideration depend for
     their effectiveness on network functionality not yet generally
     available.  In particular, one traffic reduction scheme, called the
     "bi-grid" algorithm, uses geographic filtering to ensure that
     simulation hosts receive updates only from entities within the
     range of view of their own entities.  Implementation of this
     algorithm, however, depends on a wide-area network with advanced
     multicast routing functionality involving thousands of groups, very
     dynamic membership, and resource reservation.  Another
     application-level algorithm depends on the ability to send entity
     state updates to different hosts at different frequencies, a
     functionality that could be provided by "multi-level flows," one of
     the network algorithms developed under BBN's Real-Time Multicast
     Communications (RTMC) project, described previously in this report.

     BBN's objectives under the Scalability Task are to study the
     network requirements inherent in the goals of the DIS user
     community and recommend approaches and component technology for a
     scalable DSI.

     Since the start of this task in September, the first phase of the
     work has been focused on two approaches to requirements definition.
     The first is based on observation of actual DIS traffic on the
     current DSI.  The second is based on analysis of model scenarios
     being generated by Loral Advanced Distributed Simulation (LADS) to
     represent the network traffic expected from future DIS exercises.

     Previous DSI performance monitoring has been done primarily from a
     network perspective, i.e. at layer three or lower, involving only
     approximate correlation with specific user activities.
     Measurements were limited to packet throughput at network
     interfaces.  During October and November, a plan and procedures
     were developed to expand both the kinds of measurements to be done
     and the correlation of these measurements with events of the DIS
     exercise in progress.  First trials of a subset of the techniques
     took place during DIS demonstrations at the Interservice/Industry
     Training Systems and Education Conference (I/ITSEC).  A more
     extensive application is being planned for a Synthetic Theater of
     War (STOW) Engineering Demo in mid-December.  The basic approach is
     to combine SNMP-based monitoring of network interfaces, collection
     of actual traffic samples on site LANs, and end-to-end delay
     measurement using probe packets to get a rich characterization of
     both the DIS traffic and the performance of the DSI specific to
     this traffic.

Internet Monthly Report                                    November 1993


     LADS' model scenarios provide as accurate a view as is available of
     future large-scale DIS exercises.  Among the characteristics of
     these models being derived are:

        Total required wide-area backbone bandwidth,
        Numbers of multicast groups required,
        Maximum number of groups subscribed to by each host,
        Frequency of group membership changes, and
        Group membership duration statistics.

     So far, only one model scenario has been thus analyzed.  Additional
     scenarios are expected from LADS in December.  Another type of
     analysis planned for these scenarios involves use of the DSI
     network simulator that BBN built as part of LADS "Scalability
     Toolset."  The traffic models derived from LADS' model scenarios
     will be used as input for this simulator to help determine
     effective architectures for the next generation DSI.  During
     November, auxiliary tools were built to facilitate analysis of
     simulator output.

     Inter-Domain Policy Routing
     ---------------------------

     During the month of November, we began laboratory testing of the
     new software for IDPR multicast and multipath routing.  We expect
     to continue laboratory testing during the month of December and to
     move our experiments out onto DARTNET in January.  We will release,
     in early 1994, an updated version of the IDPR protocol
     specification that includes the changes necessary to support
     multicast and multipath routing.

     DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES

     InterNIC Directory and Database Services supports a database that
     can help you find conferences and seminars that might be of
     interest to you or your collegues.

     The list is accessible via Gopher (look for "InterNIC Directory and
     Database Services", then "InterNIC Database Services", and then
     "Conference and Seminar Announcements" on any of the InterNIC
     Gopher servers) or anonymous FTP (in the directory
     "/pub/conf.announce"). The list of conference announcements can
     also be searched using WAIS (the database name is
     "conference.announce" and the server is ds.internic.net) from your
     own WAIS client or by logging in as "wais" on our server,
     ds.internic.net.

     We scan a number of Internet mailing lists looking for conference
     announcements, and insert the announcements we find in the database
     (they are deleted after the conference is over).  If you are

     Significant Events

     During the month of November, the InterNIC received a significant
     amount of publicity from several sources this month.  In the early
     portion of November, an article was written in the Wall Street
     Journal and a television show called Computer Chronciles discussed
     the Internet.  Later on in the month, an article was published in
     the December 7, 1993 issue of PC Magazine.  All of these sources
     mentioned the InterNIC phone number and discusssed the value of
     using the Internet.  Theses advertisements caused a significant
     amount of referrals to Information Services since most callers
     wanted information on how to connect to the Internet.

     Joyce Reynolds to attend the Australian Academy Research Net Workshop
     Conference in Melbourne, Australia, and participate as keynote
     speaker, November 20 - December 03 1993.

     3 RFCs were published this month.

        RFC 1544:  Rose, M., "The Content-MD5 Header Field", Dover
                   Beach Consulting, Inc., November 1993.

        RFC 1545:  Piscitello, D., "FTP Operation Over Big Address
                   Records (FOOBAR)", Bellcore, November 1993.

        RFC 1546:  Partridge, C., T. Mendez, W. Milliken, "Host
                   Anycasting Service", BBN, November 1993.

     THE US DOMAIN
     -------------

     Misdirected Requests:

     Many requests are sent to Internic for registration in EDU, ORG, or
     GOV, for organizations that should "obviously" be in the US domain.
     Part of the problem is that not everyone is aware of the US domain
     (see RFC 1480), and that what is obvious to some can't be seen at
     all by others.  The Internic forwards any requests for schools
     (K12, CC, TEC), non-federal government agencies, and other
     organizations that "obviously" fit in the US domain (such as
     Libraries, Museums).  A great deal of effort and delay results when
     discussion, explanation, and even argument, when a request for a
     name in EDU, ORG, or GOV, has to be converted into a registration
     in the US domain.

     WHOIS Database:

     One current problem area is getting domain names listed in the
     "whois" database.  The Internic has decided that it can't keep
     everything in its one central database.  The plan is to have
     distributed databases, and distributed whois servers.  However,
     there is currently no easily configured software package to
     distribute.  This is also an area of active work in the IETF.

     MULTIMEDIA CONFERENCING

     At the Houston IETF meeting, ISI (co-)chaired two working groups
     related to teleconferencing.  The Audio/Video Transport Working
     Group met for only one session this time since the draft
     specification for the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) has been
     submitted for the first RFC stage.  The emphasis of this session
     was on implementation experience, with the focus shifting to
     companion specifications for profiles and encodings.  The MMusic
     working group met for two sessions at the Houston IETF meeting.

Internet Monthly Report                                    November 1993


     The first day was dedicated to a short overview of the goals and
     context for the working group and then to a presentation of an
     algorithm and framework for managing shared session state.  The
     second meeting focused on preliminary ideas on what might comprise
     shared session state for a couple of different session types, and
     then three short presentations on related work.

     The Houston IETF marked the sixth live multicast of audio and
     video.  The number of remote hosts participanting was 629, which
     for the second time was approximately equal to the number of people
     who attended locally.

     Last month, we released mmcc, the multimedia conference control
     program, but only in binary form for Sun SPARCs.  This month we
     have been working on ports to other platforms, and expect to
     release binary versions for DEC 5000 and Alpha, HP 700, and SGI in
     December.  A source release is also planned soon.

     Eve Schooler gave a presentation "Multimedia Session Control for
     Internet Telecollaboration" over the MBone from ISI to the NASA
     Science Centers' ICNN/S Conference in Monterey, CA, Nov 17, 1993.

MERIT/MICHNET
-------------

     New MichNet affiliates during the month of November include
     Kellogg, Inc. of Battle Creek and the Metro Net Library Consortium,
     representing seven libraries in the suburban Detroit area.  Over
     the coming months, Metro Net will connect eight sites.  The first
     three 56Kbps links have been installed: direct links to Bloomfield
     Hills and Rochester Hills, and a frame relay link to Farmington
     Hills.  Merit has also assisted the Metro Net Consortium in
     installing and configuring a Unix host, providing additional data
     networking support for the consortium.  The Ford Motor Company will
     be upgrading their current 56Kbps link to Ford Research to a T1
     Internet connection.  This link will potentially provide all of
     Ford with Internet access for the first time.  The State of
     Michigan Department of Natural Resources will also be upgrading
     their MichNet link to 56Kbps and a pair of cisco routers, replacing
     the older PDP-11 system.

     MichNet is one of eight state networks joining CICNet in the Rural
     Datafication Project funded by a $1.3 million National Science
     Foundation grant.  The project's purpose of extending Internet
     access and services to underserved constituencies parallels the

     Rural Electrification Act of 1936, which brought electrical power
     to millions of rural residents.  Project funding will be used to
     establish standards and information servers for the Rural
     Datafication Project and extend the network infrastructure to an
     additional 19 rural locations throughout the region.  Three new
     points of presence (POPs) will be located in Michigan, where
     efforts will be focused on the Upper Peninsula.

     "Building a Communication Network Linking Knowledge Providers,
     Small Business Users, and Industrial Extension Agents in Michigan"
     has been funded by the ARPA defense conversion activity known as
     the Technology Reinvestment Project, TRP.  Michigan State
     University led the proposal effort, with Merit as the network
     provider in this project.  The effect of efforts through this
     proposal will be to expand dial-in access to MichNet.

     At Michigan State University, equipment for several microcomputer
     laboratories is being upgraded and new labs established.  A new Mac
     lab of 22 Centris 610s was added to Erickson Hall, and a new
     language lab will have 16 Centris 660AVs plus laser disk players.
     With dial-up use almost doubling over the past year, new high-speed
     and low-speed lines were added to the modem pool.  A total of 63
     high-speed (9600-38.4bps) and 76 low-speed (1200/2400bps) are now
     available at MSU.  Galactica, a dictionary-like database of
     computing terms, may now be found at gopher.msu.edu .

     Saginaw Valley State University has converted its campus network
     from Pronet-10 token-ring to Ethernet.  Faculty and staff with
     network connections have direct access from their workstations to
     the Internet via 10Base-T Ethernet LANs connected to Novell Netware
     servers/routers, which are in turn connected to the campus fiber
     backbone.  The Valley Library Consortium, based at SVSU, has
     installed fiber to connect its computer to the SVSU MichNet router,
     which is being upgraded to support such a connection.

     Eastern Michigan University and Merit Network, Inc. will jointly
     host the 1994 ACM SIGUCCS User Services Conference XXII.  "Meet the
     Shadowy Future," will focus on planning for change when the future
     remains uncertain.  Scheduled for October 16-20, 1994, at the
     Radisson-on-the-Lake in Ypsilanti, MI, inquiries may be sent to the
     conference mailing list SIGUCCS94@emuvax.emich.edu .

     Michigan Technological University has completed its 5-year plan for
     fiber installation and is proceeding to network the campus dorms.
     The Xylogic Annex III terminal servers were chosen for this
     initiative; asynchronous access will be implemented first, with ppp
     soon to follow.  A new trunk of 16 high-speed modems is in
     production, bringing the number of modems available to 32.

     Wayne State University is participating with Michigan State and the
     University of Michigan in a project to use PACLink.  This project
     will allow the NOTIS systems at the three sites to query each
     other.  The underlying mechanism is an RS/6000 at each site which
     will act as a gateway between the Internet and the local SNA
     system.

     The Gopher Pilot Project is underway at Wayne State.  Pilot members
     are Computing and Information Technology, Student Affairs,
     University Libraries and University Relations.  The main Gopher
     server for WSU is gopher.wayne.edu .  This machine also has a
     public client available by logging in as gopher.

     Teacher Education at Central Michigan University is installing a
     freenet server called Education Central.  This will be accessible
     through the Internet and MichNet to teachers around the state.
     This educational bulletin board and information server has received
     grant support.

     Laura Kelleher, of Merit Network Information Services, spoke on
     data networking to 200 members of the Washtenaw-Livingston Area
     Education Technology Network.  Dana Sitzler, coordinator of
     MichNet's K-12 Outreach projects, participated in the 1993 Michigan
     Educational Technology Conference and Exposition in Grand Rapids,
     Michigan.  Sheri Repucci, coordinator of MichNet recruiting
     activities, spoke to graduate students in public library service at
     the University of Michigan School of Information and Library
     Studies on public access to MichNet, its resources, and beyond to
     the global Internet.

The 16th RIPE Meeting

   The 16th RIPE Meeting was held in September 1993 in Amsterdam, The
   Netherlands.  Approval of the agenda was first, with parallel
   sessions starting after general plenaries.  This meeting was being
   audiocast to the world.

RIPE NCC Report by Daniel Karrenberg

   There are currently 450,000 Internet hosts at the end of August 1993
   and the numbers are still increasing.  Daniel presented an overview
   of the registry, document store, new database, and new software
   development.

   The RIPE NCC Internet Registry (IR)

      According to Daniel, at the the RIPE NCC IR, it is "business as
      usual".  The 193.x.y delegation is a success.  The registry has
      started using 194.x.y allocation, because there are no large
      blocks left in 192.x.y.  (Note: There are no blocks of "8"
      anymore.)  There was a need to use 194.x.y using CIDR very
      aggressively.  With the 194.x.y allocation, the RIPE NCC will be
      more conservative in using the 194.x.y address space.  There are
      still 193.x.y numbers left (about 50%).

      The Internet registry template is updated every six months.
      Daniel stressed to please us the common registry template on file.
      There is a new leaflet available (green leaflet) containing
      information about the RIPE NCC IR.

   Document Store

      World Wide Web (WWW) is now operational.  Daniel suggested to the
      group to try out xmosaic, if you are running x-windows.  The
      Gopher structure is being revised.  There will be a more detailed
      report on this at the next RIPE meeting in January 1994.  A
      general revision of the document store has been initiated.  Send
      comments to Anne Lord.

New RIPE Database Software by Marten Tempstra

   Marten presented the newly upgraded RIPE database software.  The
   question arose of why was it necessary to rewrite the software?
   Marten responded by stating that the old style took two hours a day
   (manually).  It also required many modifications to keep it running.
   The object checking was too loose, and almost always in a "don't
   touch" state.

   A design decision was made, which included a decrease in manpower for
   updates, lower turnaround times, making the database easily
   extendible, and a guarded attributes provision.  The new software is
   written in Perl, which is highly portable, nice DMB features, and
   easy to make changes.  This new software enables the staff to make
   "on the fly" updates, the updates are immediately available in WHOIS,
   and the turn around time is immediate.  There is no human
   intervention.  It also provides for a guarded attributes provision,
   improved syntax checking, a faster WHOIS server, and it can also
   manage multiple databases (same syntax).

   Current status is that there are 30 Perl modules, 3500 lines of code.
   So far, Marten and Daniel are happy with the design.  Distribution
   will be in November.

Odds and Ends by Daniel Karrenberg

   Daniel described the current RIPE NCC outlook:

        PRIDE project started (see notes below)
        One more staff being hired for it.
        Position for six month projects available.
        Populating the routing registry is next.

   What is very important to mention is that the RIPE NCC funding for
   1994 for core activities is not complete.  The budget is 260,000 ECU,
   which is about 100,000 ECU short.

Progress on Joint Projects by Tony Bates

   GISS Project Summary

      Tony mentioned that Daniel covered alot in his RIPE NCC report
      about the GISS Project summary.  It is a joint RARE/RIPE project.
      The project is finished.  It was an interesting endeavor, but at
      the same time, it wasn't an easy task.  A lot more work is needed.
      Draft 3 documentation is available via ftp.ripe.net:
      ripe/docs/ripe-drafts/giss.txt.  There is a draft charter in to
      the IETF to make a "GISS" working group.

   Route Server Project

      This project is officially over.  The RIPE NCC will continue to
      operate the route server.  The route server itself is fully
      operational.  The routing software is working well, and the policy
      based derivation is working in "kludge" mode (needs the RR
      populated).  These are all working automatically.  Collaboration
      with other projects continues.

      Work on monitoring of European routing is reported on a daily and
      weekly basis.  This project is continuing to look at the new
      networks and routing domains appearing in Europe.  The consensus
      is to use the route servers by the proto-GIX partners as soon as
      possible.  A report has been filed about this project, and is
      available via ftp.ripe.net.  This was a SURFnet funded project,
      which provided the stimulus.

   PRIDE Project

      "Policy-based Routing Implementation and Deployment in Europe"
      (PRIDE).  This project was recently started, because the routing
      situation is becoming "even more" complex.  The Route Server
      project and the RIPE 81 charters highlight the clear need for
      tools, operational based tools (i.e., configuration) and routing
      registry tools.  There needs to be policies now, they need to be
      up-to-date.  The Routing Registry is the key and needs maximum
      population for:

              1) implementation, and
              2) deployment (information and help).

      This idea is very much overdue.

      The implementation would include a "prcheck (consistency checker),
      "prpath" (path extraction), "prconn" (display connection according
      to policy), "prtractroute" (traceroute), and "prconfig"
      (configuration).  Others will be added as needed or proposed.
      Deployment means registry population and widespread use of tools.
      A PRIDE guide, and PRIDE course development documents will be
      written.

      The PRIDE Project Plan includes:

              1 Year plan (startup 1st Sept 93)
              8 Milestones
              Staged Phases (tools release, courses, guides)

Internet Monthly Report                                    November 1993


      The initial tools release will include "prtractroute".  The
      current project status includes its very own logo and t-shirts!
      Seriously, the initial release is out.  The project will be
      carried out at the RIPE NCC.  There will be two FTEs for one year,
      plus NCC support.  The funders are the JNT, UNNETT, UUNET, EUnet
      B.V..  All tools and material will be made publically available.
      There's funding to "come to you", if regionals cannot participate.
      They are open to all comments, as the intention is to become a
      RIPE NCC core activity.

RIPE NCC Review by Rob Blokzijl

   The RIPE NCC activity document is out and needs to be discussed.
   This new activity plan identifies the areas they have been doing, but
   not funded.  For example, the Internet Registry.  The 1991 RIPE NCC
   activity plan did not include the IR.  Rob asked for continued
   discussion and input on the revised plan, which will start on the 1st
   January 1994.

RARE and RIPE Relationships

   RIPE came into being as the IP coordination in Europe.  The RARE
   emphasis is still the same.  These two groups want to avoid
   duplication of activities.  They have joint projects that are
   defined, run, and funded.

GARR's Network Resource Discovery by Giuseppe Romano

   Giuseppe Romano of GARR (Italian Research and Academic Network
   Network Information Service) gave a presentation on GARR's on-line
   network resource guide.  This guide was produced to support end users
   to find information, and to help end users to access selected
   resources.  This topic will also be discussed in the NIDUS Working
   Group meeting (see notes below).

   The GARR resource guide is an experimental on-line service.  A.
   Blasco Bonito suggested that this service should be placed at the
   RIPE NCC.  Some RIPE meeting participants suggested that this service
   should be brought into Jill Foster's RARE ISUS (Information Services
   and User Support) group.

EARN's Network Resource Guide by Daniele Bovio

   There was a joint RARE/EARN meeting regarding each group's efforts
   and focus.  A pact between them has been settled that EARN will
   specifically focus on user support.  Their resource guide is a
   combined effort of EARN staff members.  Drafts for each chapter were
   submitted and compiled.  Then, everything was given to David Sitman

Internet Monthly Report                                    November 1993


   (as EARN project coordinator).  The guide was produced in time for
   the JENC (Joint European Networking Conference) Trondheim conference.
   A 1 July 93 revised draft was presented and discussed at the
   Amsterdam IETF in Joyce Reynolds' USWG (User Services Working Group)
   session.  A second editon of this guide will be available by the
   Warsaw NSC (Network Services Conference) meeting.  Bert Stals of the
   RARE ISUS working group assisted with input and comments.  The first
   edition of the guide was distributed at the JENC, IETF, and INET93.
   The guide is directed to all end users.

Local Internet Registry Group by Daniel Karrenberg

   The Local Internet Registry Group held a workshop at the beginning of
   the week before the RIPE meetings.  A question was brought up whether
   their workshops should be held at the same time as the RIPE meetings.
   A decision was made that they will continue to be informal, with no
   keeping of minutes, and to keep holding them in conjunction with the
   RIPE meetings, to cut down on travel.

   There was a discussion about publishing local registries, as the
   current policy is to not publish them.  All local registries are
   running smoothly.  Some service providers say that they don't want
   this.  Customers will be revealed.  They don't want to publish their
   own lists.  The argument was that it doesn't make any sense to hide
   this information.  Daniel made mention that this is not in the spirit
   of the Internet.  Analogy would be once you start hiding the IP
   contacts, the next will be the Domains.  Service provides need to
   accept responsibility.  They must assume formal responsibility,
   essentially because there are more service providers every year.
   This issue must be resolved, eventhough the Internet is subtly
   becoming commercial.  Look at the different exchange service
   infrastructures that are included.

   Daniel will take all comments, summarize and provide a proposal.  The
   biggest issue is the operational contact points.  Daniel would like
   to propose that the RIPE NCC publish ALL registries, provider and
   non-provider by country.  The group agreed that there should be a
   complete list of local IRs.  A. Blasco Bonito requested further
   discussion off-line about the functions of the non-provider registry.
   The results of this proposal will be in put the RIPE NCC activity
   plan.

   The group discussed future needed documents.  One document would be
   an FAQ on CIDR and subnetting, and another document would be
   appropriate on why is it good Internet citizenship to give back IP
   address space.

Internet Monthly Report                                    November 1993


   Administration of top level domains was discussed.  The group felt
   the Lebanon top level domain request took too long.  If this happens
   in Europe, it might be good to have the RIPE NCC handle the proces.
   There was no objection from this group.  The idea is to have the RIPE
   NCC jump in when there isn't any consensus in a country and have the
   NCC handle it.  Daniel said the RIPE NCC is willing to provide this
   service, and he will communicate this to the IANA.

BOF session on European Architecture Development by Bernhard Stockman

   The intent is to maintain and improve routing between Europe and the
   U.S.  This is an operational engineering issue that Bernhard is
   trying to deal with here, not routing issues.  First, he would like
   to identify the level of ambition, and whether it is on a complex or
   intermediate level.  The issues include:

           -What  is routing stability?
           -Look at the progress of CIDR development in Europe
           -What is the level of complexity?
                   a) multiple Internet Services providers
                   b) see a need for some kind of interchange
                   c) address ideas on where - possible locations
                   d) who can connect?  who is acceptable as a peer?
                   e) what does this group want to say about this?
                   f) regulator issues - who is in charge?
                   g) is there a need for a management framework?
           -Technical needs
                   a) technical requirements specification
                   b) time estimations to operate
                   c) source based policy routing (SDRP) pilot - this
                      is happening in the IETF, but what can
                      the RIPE group do?

Report on the EBONE Consortium Meeting

   There is already a plan in place with the continuation of the EBONE
   effort (EBONE2) of a distributed GIX (D-GIX).  D-GIX was
   overwhelmingly approved, as there is an urgent need for a full fledge
   solution.  The interim solution of interconnectivity ("Interim D-
   GIX") was discussed.  The group needs to agree if this is a good
   idea.  There would be an initial separation of routing and payload
   traffic, but is there a need to do this?  The issues include:

           -separation of routing and payload
           -a D-GIX specification is needed
           -need for some kind of informal/formal body to be responsible
            for operational issues
           -need for some kind of pilot phase that would:

                   a) specify what
                   b) specify time schedules
                   c) goals
           -a SDRP/multifacet router might happen
            other groups (RARE, etc.) may look into this
           -simplify route server implementation of a D-GIX
           -need for improvements
           -flexibility versus connectivity in D-GIX

   Other issues to consider:

           -routing registry population - "pushing"?
           -secret routing information - consider this?
           -liaisons with the IEPG - need to liase with more operations
            related forums that exist within the various continents.

   Bernhard opened the floor for comments.  Is there a need for a
   working group in RIPE to work on this issue?  The group stated a
   resounding yes.  The maintenance and improvement of routing between
   Europe and the U.S. is the main issue.  This is much more focussed
   and defined on an operations level.  This item needs to stay within
   the RIPE framework.  This new working group would be on neutral
   ground and open (like an operations forum).

   What about "beyond D-GIX"?  This working group would be an evolving
   group, which would concentrate on D-GIX right now, but would keep
   their eyes and ears open.  The major item the attendees see as
   missing is a requirement document.

Network Information Discovery for Users Support (NIDUS WG)

   The NIDUS WG, chaired by Nandor Hovarth, held a session at this RIPE
   meeting.  Joyce Reynolds presented a report on the IETF User Services
   Area activities and meetings held during the Amsterdam IETF in July
   (see Appendix).

   Nandor lead a continued discussion regarding GARR's Resource Guide
   (see above).  The group felt that this resource guide could have two
   paths to follow.

           -continue building on the guide as is and keep enhancing it
           -find out if a pilot project group needs to be started to
            help in the development of the specialization of each item
            within the guide
           -would RIPE be the forum for this pilot or RARE?

                       Amsterdam, The Netherlands
                        Joyce K. Reynolds (USAD)


   10 working groups in the User Services Area of the IETF met in
   Amsterdam.


   Integrated Directory Services (IDS), chaired by Chris Weider and
   Tim Howes.  (Summary reported by Chris Weider.)

   The IDS Working Group is chartered to facilitate the integration and
   interoperability of current and future directory services into a
   unified directory service.  This work will unite directory services
   based on a heterogeneous set of directory services protocols (X.500,
   WHOIS++, etc.).  In addition to specifying technical requirements for
   the integration, the IDS Group will also contribute to the
   administrative and maintenance issues of directory service offerings
   by publishing guidelines on directory data integrity, maintenance,
   security, and privacy and legal issues for users and administrators of
   directories.

   The "Advanced Usages of X.500" document from the DISI WG has been
   sent to the RFC Editor for publication.  The "Pilot Project" catalog is
   out as an Internet-Draft (I-D).  The Revision of FYI 11 has been
   released as an I-D and will be submitted to the RFC Editor for
   publication by the end of August 1993.  A draft on, "Legal & Privacy
   Issues in Directory Services" was submitted and will be published as an
   I-D.  A draft on, "A Guide to Available Directory Services" was
   circulated and will be advanced as an I-D for eventual publication as
   an Informational RFC.  The Directory Services Policy Handbook will be
   split into pieces and will be released as a series of documents.


   Integration of Internet Information Resources Working Group (IIIR),
   chaired by Chris Weider.  (Summary reported by Chris Weider.)

   IIIR is chartered to facilitate interoperability between Internet
   Information Services, and to develop, specify, and align protocols
   designed to integrate the plethora of Internet information services
   (WAIS, archie, Prospero, etc.) into a single "virtually unified
   information service".

Internet Monthly Report                                    November 1993


   IIIR met twice at this IETF.  At the first session, the HTML I-D from

   Tim Berners-Lee was discussed, and will be submitted as an
   Informational RFC.  The HTTP protocol will also be released as an I-D
   before the next IETF.  HTML+ may be brought in as a potential
   standard.  At the second session, the "Vision of an Integrated
   Internet Information Architecture" document is still an ID, as
   comments have come in that need to be incorporated.  The "Resource
   Transponders" document was discussed.  The potential overlap with the
   Service Location group's work has still not resolved.

   The "Taxomomy of Information Services" document has been shelved as
   other papers have recently been published on this work.  There are
   some minor problems with the Gopher RFC which will be addressed in an
   addendum.  The Prospero protocol was suggested as a means of
   Integrating Information Services.  Discussion on this item will be
   taken to the IIIR WG email list.  The Gopher/IIIR datatype
   specifications will be registered as MIME types.  A document will be
   written on failure tracking and resolution between information
   services.  "Z39.50 over TCP/IP" will be released as an I-D, to
   eventually become an Informational RFC.  A paper on integrating data
   elements between the IAFA WG's paper and the library community will be
   released as an I-D.


   Internet School Networking (ISN) session led by Jennifer Sellers
   (NASA).  (Summary reported by Jennifer Sellers.)

   The Internet School Networking Working Group is chartered to
   facilitate the connection of the United States' K-12
   (Kindergarten-12th Grade) schools, public and private, to the
   Internet, and school networking in general.

   After some background on the history of ISN, the group shared
   experiences in school networking and their own companies and projects.
   There were 30 or 35 people in attendance and almost all had more than
   a passing interest in school networking.  Next, the group gave a lot
   of good feedback on the document currently under construction, the I-D
   on FAQs for the Primary and Secondary School Community.  Also
   discussed was a document on Connectivity Models for schools.  It was
   decided that this document will be combined with the UserDoc2's
   document on how to connect, and will be put out as an I-D.
   The final agenda item was a review and revision of the group's
   charter.  After some discussion, three volunteers from three different
   countries agreed to craft the text for a new charter and post it to
   the list.  From there, the group will determine new deliverables and
   milestones.

   Networked Information Retrieval (NIR), chaired by Jill Foster and
   George Brett.  (Summary reported by Kevin Gamiel.)

   NIR is chartered to increase the useful base of information about
   networked information retrieval tools, their developers, interested
   organizations, and other activities that relate to the production,
   dissemination, and support of NIR tools.  NIR is a cooperative effort
   of the IETF, RARE, and CNI.

   Jim Fullton gave an overview of CNIDR.  Jill Foster gave a brief
   overview of the RARE ISUS work in the NIR area.  Anders Gillner
   discussed his work on the Eurogopher project.  This project involves
   establishing a subject-based as well as geographic-based Gopher
   infrastructure in Europe.  The group then spent most of the meeting
   editing the NIR report.  Major changes included the merging of the
   WAIS and freeWAIS sections, NCSA's Mosaic was moved under the WWW
   section, and the NLM sections were removed.  Various methods of
   publishing and maintaining this information online were discussed.
   Several suggestions for evaluating NIR tools was discussed.  It was
   decided to put together a simple checklist as the basis of the
   evaluation. There will be further discussion on the mailing list.  The
   charter was updated to remove the reference to documentation and
   training materials.


   The Network Information Services Infrastructure Working Group (NISI),
   chaired by April Marine and Pat Smith.  (Summary reported by April
   Marine.)

   NISI is exploring the requirements for common, shared Internet-wide
   network information services.  The goal is to develop an understanding
   for what is required to implement an information services
   "infrastructure" for the Internet.

   The NISI Working Group discussed two main topics.  First, comments on
   the current I-D were solicited and a discussion of the relationships
   between network information centers (NICs) ensued, resulting in
   suggested revisions to the document's diagram.  Secondly, the scope of
   recommendations for interactions between NICs when more than one are
   involved in helping a user were clarified.  The group benefitted
   greatly from the international input available in this forum and both
   documents currently in progress should be much improved.


   Network Training Materials (TRAINMAT), chaired by Ellen Hoffman and
   Jill Foster.  (Summary reported by Ellen Hoffman.)

   The Network Training Materials Working Group is chartered to enable

Internet Monthly Report                                    November 1993


   the research community to make better use of the networked services.
   Towards this end, the Working Group will work to provide a
   comprehensive package of "mix and match" training materials for the
   broad academic community which will: 1) enable user support staff to
   train users to use the networked services and 2) provide users with
   self-paced learning material.  In the first instance, it will not deal
   with operational training.  This Working Group is the IETF component
   of a joint RARE/IETF group working on Network Training Materials.

   The meeting opened with introductions and descriptions of training
   activities in which each person is involved.  Jill Foster discussed
   the RARE ISUS Network Training Materials TF as well as the NISP/ITTI
   project at the University of Newcastle, UK.  The group reviewed data
   elements for the training materials catalog, and agreed on the general
   categories which Foster presented with a few suggested changes.  A
   small group will finalize the template and send it out to the list.
   Volunteers were recruited to work on the catalog.  Another project the
   group will pursue is a subject resource guide.  Issues in using the
   network to deliver interactive and multi-media training were
   discussed, with the possibility for developing multi-media pilots
   reviewed.  A demo of the materials developed at Newcastle was given by
   Jill Foster.


   User-Doc2, chaired by Ellen Hoffman and Lenore Jackson (not present).
   (Summary reported by Ellen Hoffman.)

   The User-Doc2 Working Group is preparing a revised bibliography of
   on-line and hard copy documents, reference materials, and training
   tools addressing general networking information and how to use the
   Internet.  The target audience includes those individuals who provide
   services to end users and end users themselves.

   The User Doc Working Group reviewed recent activities, including the
   release of FYI RFCs 19 and 20 since the last IETF meeting.  The archive,
   Introducing the Internet, has been updated, adding two additional
   documents and revising the Access Guide.  Four sites currently house
   copies of the archive, and others are encouraged to maintain it.  A
   discussion on documentation needs was held, staring with a talk by
   Bert Stals on activities by the ISUS Documentation group.  Issues
   relating to documentation in languages other than English and covering
   a more world-wide perspective in RFCs was covered.  The final topic was
   new activities, with two future FYI RFCs in the works.  These are a
   revision of FYI 3 which is to be finalized at the next meeting, and a
   new document on how to get connected which is just being started.

   Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI), chaired by Alan Emtage and Jim
   Fullton.  (Summary reported by Jim Fullton.)

   URI is chartered to define a set of standards for the encoding of
   system independent Resource Location and Identification information
   for the use of Internet information services.

   The URI Working Group met in three sessions to discuss various issues
   related to URLs, URNs and URCs.  The current URL proposal along with
   an amendment to expand the allowable character set was approved by a
   vote of 29 to 1.  A report on the Info Mesh was made by Karen Sollins.

   URNs were discussed in great detail.  Agreement was reached on the
   basic format of URNs as well as their content.  Sub elements of the
   URN remain undefined and will be discussed at the next IETF.

   A paper describing a proposed URM was discussed, as were proposals for
   the format of URCs.  A call for papers describing URMs and URCs was
   made, with discussion to be carried out on the list.  Next time: 1)
   Discuss URN sub fields, and 2) Discuss URC/URM formats.


   User Services Working Group (USWG) chaired by Joyce K. Reynolds.
   (Summary reported by JKRey.)

   The USWG provides a regular forum for people interested in all user
   services to identify and initiate projects designed to improve the
   quality of information available to end-users of the Internet.

   Joyce Reynolds reported on the IETF User Services Area activities
   including: Working Groups coming to closure and new Working groups
   starting up, new publications, and current user services related
   Internet-Drafts postings.

   April Marine led a discussion on an FYI RFC update; FYI 4 "FYI on
   Questions and Answers: Answers to Commonly asked "New Internet User"
   Questions", (Also RFC 1325), May 1992.  Bill Manning brought up a
   discussion on how to "empower" users to utilize and document tools.
   There also seems to be missing from the FYI RFC publications a series
   of notes that tries to address the manners and morals of the
   collective body.  Another topic that may need to be worked on in this
   forum is how to deal with the basics (e.g., How do "I" get attached?).

   Jill Foster presented an update on RARE activities, including a
   report on the RARE Information Services/User Services (ISUS)
   activities.

Internet Monthly Report                                    November 1993


   David Sitman EARN (European Academic and Research Network)
   representative presented a discussion and review of EARN's "Guide to
   Network Resource Tools" in preparation for submission to the RFC
   Editor for FYI RFC publication.


   Whois and Network Information Lookup Service (WNILS), chaired by Joan
   Gargano.  (Summary reported by Joan Gargano.)

   The purpose of WNILS is to expand and define the standard for WHOIS
   services, to resolve issues associated with the variations in access,
   and to promote a consistent and predictable service across the
   network.

   Many attendees were new to the WNILS working group and requested
   an introduction to the Whois++ architecture.  Peter Deutsch presented
   an overview of the Whois++ architecture and design philosophy.  A
   lengthy discussion followed and the following additions to the
   protocol were requested.  Peter will incorporate the additional
   specifications and submit an I-D by July 30, 1993.

   Chris Weider also began his presentation with an overview of
   centroids.  Two problem areas were identified: a) Centroids don't
   scale for databases containing large quantities of unique data, and b)
   The potential exists for cycles or looping in queries because the
   directory is in a mesh configuration.  Chris agreed further work is
   needed on indexing but this first implementation should provide a
   functional system for existing datasets and a testbed for the
   limitations of this model.

   The recommended modifications to the Whois Protocol have been
   submitted as an I-D.  The host record section will be updated.  The
   goals and milestones will be updated to reflect the following: All
   draft papers will be submitted as I-Ds by the end of July.  Two
   working implementations of clients, servers and centroids will be
   available by September 30, 1993.
