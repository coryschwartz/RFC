INTERNET MONTHLY REPORTS
------------------------

The purpose of these reports is to communicate to the Internet Research
Group the accomplishments, milestones reached, or problems discovered by
the participating organizations.

     This report is for Internet information purposes only, and is not
     to be quoted in other publications without permission from the
     submitter.

Each organization is expected to submit a 1/2 page report on the first
business day of the month describing the previous month's activities.
These reports should be submitted via network mail to "IMR@ISI.EDU".

The Internet Monthly Report list is now managed by MajorDomo at ISI.EDU.
The announcements of new issues on the Internet Monthly Report are sent
to the IETF-Announce list and to this IMR list.

Requests to be ADDED or DELETED from the Internet Monthly report list
should be sent to "majordomo@isi.edu" with the message body either
"subscribe imr" or "unsubscribe imr".

Details on obtaining the current IMR, or back issues, via FTP or EMAIL
may be obtained by sending an EMAIL message to "rfc-info@ISI.EDU" with
the message body "help: ways_to_get_imrs".  For example:

INTERNET ENGINEERING REPORTS
----------------------------

     1. As I write this report, we are getting ready for the next IETF
        meetig, which will be held in Los Angeles, California from March
        4-8, 1996. There will not be a local host for this meeting, but
        the terminal room facilities will be provided by Interop.
        Following Los Angeles, the IETF will be meeting in Montreal,
        Quebec, Canada from June 24-28, 1996. If this date looks
        familiar, it is the same date as INET '96! This is not a "joint"
        meeting per se, but both meetings will be held in the Montreal
        Convention Center, and INET will be providing an extraordinarily
        large terminal room for both INET96 and IETF attendees.

        Closing out the year, the IETF will be returning to San Jose,
        California on December 9-13, 1996. Following that, the IETF
        travels to Memphis, Tennessee where Federal Express will be the
        host. This meeting will be held April 7-11, 1997.

        Once all the arrangements have been made, notifications will be
        sent to the IETF Announcement list. Remember that information
        on future IETF meetings can be always be found in the file
        0mtg-sites.txt which is located on the IETF shadow directories.
        This information can also be viewed from the IETF Home Page on
        the Web. The URL is:

                     http://www.ietf.cnri.reston.va.us


     2. The minutes of the IESG teleconferences have been publicly
        available on the IETF Shadow directories since 1991. These
        files are placed in the /ftp/iesg directory.

        The following IESG minutes have been added:

           January 18, 1996 (iesg.96-01-18)
           February 8, 1996 (iesg.96-02-08)

INTERNIC
--------

     INTERNIC DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES

     In February, we started porting our production servers to Solaris.
     The porting process takes some time, since all applications must be
     tested on the new operating system to make sure the setup was done
     properly.  In addition, some applications (notably Archie) require
     that databases be rebuilt because we are using new versions of the
     software.

     This means that the server being converted to Solaris will be out
     of service for an extended period.  This should not bother users
     connecting to ds.internic.net, since they will reach one of the
     servers that is still up.  If users connect to a specific server,
     either by name (i.e. ds1.internic.net instead of the general
     ds.internic.net) or by specific address, they will see outages.
     Users may also see problems if they have bookmarks or other saved
     pointers to a specific machine.

     The first server to be upgraded is ds1.  It will be followed by ds0
     and ds2.  We will never intentionally take down more than one of
     our servers at a time.

     A reminder - if you would like to help the Internet community find
     a resource that you offer, send mail to admin@ds.internic.net and
     we will send information about listing your resource in the
     Directory of Directories.  If you prefer, you can enter information
     about your resource in our WWW suggestion form.  The form can be
     reached through our Directory of Directories Web page at:

     THE US DOMAIN REGISTRY
     ----------------------

     The US Domain Registry has installed a client/server Rwhois protocol
     to support the US Domain WHOIS information.  We register third level
     delegations.  For example, K12.IL.US, TACOMA.WA.US, or STATE.MN.US
     would have entries in the US WHOIS database. To look up a US domain
     name, do the following:

             whois -h nii.isi.edu <domain-name>

     We request all third level subdomain administrators of the US Domain
     to operate a RWHOIS server for those subdomains under them.

     See http://www.isi.edu/us-domain/RWhois Sources and Information for
     more information.

     For further information about the US Domain, send a message to:
     US-DOMAIN@ISI.EDU, or browse our WEB page:

MERIT INTERNET ENGINEERING
--------------------------

This report summarizes recent activities of Merit's Internet Engineering
group on behalf of the Routing Arbiter (RA) service and other projects.

A new set of Routing Arbiter Web pages takes users step-by-step through
the process of registering in the Routing Arbiter Database and
establishing a peering session with Route Servers at the NAPs.  The
materials introduce the RADB and other registries based on the RIPE-181
specification and explain how to specify various routing policies in the
RADB.  A series of forms and templates then automates the process of
obtaining an AS number from the InterNIC and an IP address for the
user's router at the NAP.  The materials are available at:

    http://www.ra.net/nap_customer

The new worksheets were presented at a workshop for NAP customers
following the sixth North American Network Operators' Group (NANOG)
meeting, hosted by the San Diego Supercomputer Center on February 15-16.
Stan Barber of Academ Consulting Services has kindly made available a
complete set of notes and slides from the meeting.  They are available
through Merit's Web site, http://www.merit.edu/~nanog.  Bill Norton
moderated the meeting, which featured the following presentations:

January and February's efforts to identify, correct, and remove
inaccurate or obsolete AS objects from the Routing Arbiter Database have
significantly improved the accuracy of data in the RADB.  After working
with the individuals authorized to modify the AS's database records, the
RADB staff removed from the database 179 AS objects that were duplicated
in other IRR registries and had no policy information (i.e., no as-in
and as-out definitions).  Almost all of these objects were remnants of
the May 1995 transition from the Policy Routing Database to the Routing
Arbiter Database.  Among the RADB AS objects that are not duplicated in
another IRR registry, 120 have policy information and 324 do not.  Those
non-duplicated AS objects without policy lines will be retained in the
RADB to serve as input for global routing tools.

New Route Server peering sessions were established this month by
IConNet, CWInet, HLCnet, MFSnet, and Scruz-Net.  More than 39 providers
are now peering with the RSs at the interconnection points.  For a
complete list of peers, see:

    http://www.ra.net/statistics/bgp.peers

Bill Norton and Elise Gerich attended an NSF workshop on Internet
Statistics Measurement and Analysis this month.  Discussion topics
included characterization of the Internet work load, Internet
measurement infrastructure, flow characterization and control, scaling,
security, and pricing.  Gerich also attended a meeting of the
Engineering and Operations Working Group/FEPG. At a workshop focusing on
future directions for U.S. Internet registries, she moderated a panel on
DNS administration and IP address allocation.  The workshop was
sponsored by NSF and hosted by the CIX.
