                      IETF Monthly Report for May, 1994

     1. Let me remind everyone that the next meeting of the IETF will
        be held in Toronto, Canada from July 25 through July 29, 1994.
        This meeting is being hosted by The University of Toronto. The
        Newcomers' Orientation and Registration Reception will be on
        Sunday, July 24. Logistic messages and registration forms have
        already been sent to the IETF Announcement list.

        Following the July meeting, the IETF will be in San Jose from
        December 5-9. We currently working on the IETF meetings in 1995,
        looking at the Boston area in April of 1995, and on to Stockholm
        Sweden in July. Once the primary arrangements have been made,
        notifications will be sent to the IETF Announcement list.
        Remember that information on future IETF meetings can be always
        be found in the file 0mtg-sites.txt which is located on the IETF
        shadow directories.

     2. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Dan Jordt, Terry
        Gray, and all the folks at NorthWestNet and the University of
        Washington for hosting the 29th IETF meeting in Seattle. They
        did a marvelous job.

        At the Thursday evening plenary session in Seattle, the new
        members of the IESG were announced. The current IESG members
        are:

INTERNET PROJECTS
-----------------

ANSNET/NSFNET BACKBONE ENGINEERING
----------------------------------

     Network Status Summary
     ======================

     ANSnet total packet traffic grew by about 4.3% in April '94.  The
     process of CIDR aggregation continued in April.  A decrease in the
     ANSnet forwarding table size of 6.3% was observed during the month
     of April due to the withdrawal of 4,841 class based destinations.

     April Backbone Traffic Statistics
     =================================

     The total inbound packet count for the ANSnet (measured using
     SNMP interface counters) was 60,204,842,812 on T3 ENSS
     interfaces, up 3.77% from April.  The total packet count into the
     network including all ENSS serial interfaces was 71,037,687,355 up
     4.26% from April.

     Router Forwarding Table Statistics
     ==================================

     The maximum number of destinations announced to the ANSnet
     during May was 18,484 down 6.27% from April.  This continued
     decrease in the monthly forwarding table size is attributed to CIDR
     aggregation.

     The number of network destinations configured for
     announcement to the ANSnet but never announced (silent nets)
     during April was 12,084.

     BGP-4/CIDR Deployment Status
     ===========================

     The following autonomous systems are now exchanging routing
     information with ANSnet via the BGP-4 protocol for the first time
     during April.

Internet Monthly Report                                         May 1994


     As of May 31 '94, we have observed the withdrawal of 4,841 class
     based destinations from the ANSnet router forwarding tables that
     are now represented by 545 configured aggregates.  Among these
     configured aggregates:

         475 of these are top-level aggregates (not nested in another
         aggregate).

         386 of these are actively announced to ANSnet.

         331 of these have at least one subnet configured (the other
         22 may be saving the Internet future subnet announcements).

         280 of these have resulted in the withdrawal of at least
         one configured more specific route.

         275 of these have resulted in the withdrawal of 50% of
         their configured more specific routes.

         269 of these have resulted in the withdrawal of most (80%+)
         of their more specific routes.

     For up-to-date information is available from merit.edu:
     pub/nsfnet/cidr/cidr-savings.

     For further details on these CIDR aggregates, see
     merit.edu:pub/nsfnet/cidr/nestings.announced for full listings.

     Other gated software changes will be deployed over the next couple
     of months to improve policy processing (required to support some
     advanced forms of proxy aggregation).

     Routing Stability Measured on the T3 Network
     ============================================

     The three different routing stability measurements that have been
     reported on over the past year were based on rcp_routed log file
     entries.  Gated software was deployed at the end of February to
     replace rcp_routed.  These routing stability reports have been
     converted to use gated logging as of early June.  The next report
     based upon this data will be published in early July.

     DANTE TO DEFINE 'SUPER HIGHWAY' FOR EUROPEAN RESEARCH

     DANTE has been awarded a contract in the framework of the Eureka
     EuroCAIRN (European Cooperation for Academic and Industrial
     Research Networking) Project to specify requirements and outline a
     plan for the delivery of a 34-155 Mbps network infrastructure for
     the European research community.

     Dai Davies, General Manager of DANTE, commented: "The timing for
     this could not have been better: now we have a major opportunity to
     streamline pan-European networking to complement the national
     high-speed initiatives in for instance the UK, Netherlands, Germany
     and the Nordic countries. This is the only way to create a truly
     complementary pan-European infrastructure."

     In January 1994 DANTE submitted a detailed proposal to produce such
     a specification this year. The EuroCAIRN Committee had already
     accepted the proposal in principle in April and details have now
     been finalised. DANTE will start the work immediately.

     Three main issues will be addressed in the specification:
     technology, organisation, and commercial management of the High
     Speed Service. Technical issues relate to the availability of
     circuits and advanced services from PNOs, topology planning, and
     connectivity requirements to other continents, as well as an
     assessment of relevant applications. No less challenging are
     organisational and commercial issues such as management,



Cooper                                                         [Page 11]

Internet Monthly Report                                         May 1994


     operational and financial aspects of delivering the service.
     Basically the technology is available and major issues relate to
     regulatory constraints and obtaining sensible prices and timely
     availability of service.

     The work will be carried out by DANTE in close cooperation with
     leading specialists in Europe. A small group of key persons have
     already committed themselves to joining the project team.

     MAJOR INCREASE IN EUROPANET CONNECTIVITY TO THE US

     DANTE will expand its existing connectivity to the US from 3,5 to
     10 Mbps. The capacity increase will be used to support traffic
     growth as a result of the deployment of high speed networks in some
     European countries, in particular The Netherlands. The increase
     involves implementing a 8 Mbps line between Amsterdam and
     Washington.

     This line will constitute the largest link between the US and the
     European part of the Internet research backbone. SURFnet, the Dutch
     national research network, will be the first customer to benefit
     from the 8 Mbps intercontinental connectivity.

     Boudewijn Nederkoorn, Managing Director of SURFnet, said: "We need
     this capacity increase to meet our short term bandwidth
     requirements. We are in the process of setting up an ATM backbone
     in the Netherlands of nine 34 Mbps connections, and the traffic
     growth to the US simply demands more capacity than 2 Mbps." SURFnet
     will be by far the biggest single customer for intercontinental
     connectivity, but the benefits from the capacity increase will
     serve researchers on both sides of the Atlantic.

     DANTE has already started negotiations with possible line suppliers
     and expects to have the line in place by October 1994.

     UPGRADE AMSTERDAM-PRAGUE LINE FOR INETU94/JENC5

     On the occasion of the Workshop for Technically Emerging Countries
     and the INETU94/JENC5 conference DANTE has organised an upgrade
     from 64 kbps to 512 kbps  of the existing EuropaNET connection in
     Prague. Funding for the upgrade is provided through the CEC PHARE
     program; the Czech Republic was connected to the EuropaNET backbone
     in 1993 under the same program.

     DANTE has organised the upgrade to meet the networking requirements
     of the hundreds of Workshop and Conference attendees. The DANTE
     line will be used to support the increase in general IP traffic,
     such as e-mail, between Prague and continental Europe; DANTE is

Internet Monthly Report                                         May 1994


     seeking funds to keep the 512 kbps connection in place after the
     event.

     For the occasion a new trunk line is provided by DANTE. The final
     link in the connection is established via two local loops, from the
     EuropaNET node in the PTT building in Prague: one to the Technical
     University, where the Workshop takes place, and the second to the
     Palace of Culture, the venue of the Conference.

     DANTE has put a lot of effort in setting up the line and has
     liaised with all involved parties, including Unisource, the Czech
     PTT, and CEC-PHARE.

     MORE EUROPANET ENHANCEMENTS

     DANTE has arranged with SURFnet to continue to make use of the T1
     (1.5 Mbps) line between Amsterdam and CERN during the second half
     of 1994. The line, that used to be part of Ebone, will connect
     DANTE's Points of Presence (PoPs) in Amsterdam and CERN. The
     arrangement enables DANTE to implement several enhancements to the
     EuropaNET Service.

     The line will provide a direct back-up route between the European
     ends of DANTE's two transatlantic lines; in case of a failure of
     one of the transatlantic lines, traffic can be diverted
     automatically to the other one without imposing any extra load on
     EMPB. It will also be used as part of the Ebone/EuropaNET
     interconnection which DANTE has proposed to Ebone for the second
     half of 1994. CERN, as one of the locations where EuropaNET and
     Ebone are both present, will be used as the actual point of
     interconnection but traffic will flow in and out of EMPB through
     DANTE's PoP in Amsterdam.

     Similar arrangements are being made for a EUnet interconnection.
     The principle of establishing a 64 kbps interconnection with
     EuropaNET in Amsterdam has already been agreed; the ways in which
     any additional capacity that is required will be funded is still
     being discussed.

     Since no new lines are required to set up these services, DANTE is
     confident that they will be operational by 1 July 1994.

     THE KOREAN CONNECTION

     A contract for the provision of a 64 kbps line between EuropaNET
     and KREONET, the Korean research network, was signed between DANTE
     and the CEC in February 1994. The circuit has now been ordered and
     should be operational within a few months. It will be the first

Internet Monthly Report                                         May 1994


     direct link between the European research community and an R&D
     network in the Pacific Rim. So far cooperation between European and
     Korean researchers has been relatively weak.

     NAMEFLOW: ANOTHER DANTE FLOWSERVICE

     NameFLOW is the successor to the PARADISE Project, which was part
     of the EUREKA COSINE Project, and had the remit to pilot a
     coordinated international directory service for the European
     Research Community. DANTE will take on the challenge of
     transforming the pilot into an operational service.

     In parallel with the provision of the service DANTE will - in
     cooperation with its customers - define a strategy for the future
     development of international directory services. Opinions on this
     issue vary considerably within the European research community.

     CALL FOR TENDER MailFLOW - REMINDER

     An open Call for Tender for the provision MHS-Coordination,
     MailFLOW, has been issued by DANTE.

     Tender requirements are available from the DANTE gopher server, in
     the MailFLOW directory (dir /FLOWservices or URL:
     gopher://gopher.dante.net:70/00/pub/flowservices/mail/call-for-
     tender-95). The deadline for submitting proposals is 30 June 1994.

     DIRECTORY AND DATABASE SERVICES

     InterNIC Directory and Database Services makes a number of
     databases accessible to the Internet community on our servers.
     These databases can be found in the pub directory under FTP, and
     are also accessible via Gopher (through your own Gopher client or
     through the "gopher" or "guest" logins on our servers), World Wide
     Web, and our mail server.  Some are also searchable using WAIS.

     Some of the more recent additions include:

        - Information on the National Performance Review (in
        pub/npr.email.lab).  The National Performance Review (NPR) is
        conducted under the office of the Vice President in an effort
        to improve the efficiency and productivity of the Federal
        Government. Vice President Gore's report of the National
        Performance Review stated "...government-wide E-Mail will
        make the government work better and cost less".  The
        Electronic Support Services Environment (ESSE, pronounced
        "easy") E-Mail Laboratory, a component of the NPR, was
        established to enact recommendations from Vice President
        Gore's report.  ESSE maintains this library which contains
        documents related to the NPR.

     LANai 1.1 Chips Arrive
     ----------------------

     During May the first of the Mosaic successor chips, LANai 1.1,
     arrived from Myricom.  These chips are designed specifically for
     LAN rather than multicomputer application.  They are installed and
     running in the SPARCstation-2s that we use for development.

     The ATOMIC group here at USC/ISI and Chuck Seitz's group at Caltech
     built upon the experiences that we had with the Mosaic chips in
     creating the ATOMIC LAN.  It was clear that there were some changes
     needed if a transition was to be made from research testbed to a
     commercial network.

     Although well-suited for use as pieces of a multicomputer, the
     Mosaic chips really were not designed for the less-controlled
     communication environment of a pysically distributed LAN.  There
     were also some performance improvements that could be made and
     enhancements that better suited LAN application.

     The key differences from the Memoryless Mosaic chips that were used
     in the ATOMIC prototype LAN are:

       1) A 40 meter cable interface with flow control, link CRC,
          blocked path draining, and remote reset capability.

       2) A memory architecture that supports 2*channel performance.
          This allows a 500 Mb/s channel transfer and DMA transfer
          to/from host memory in parallel.

       3) Interrupt timer with four microsecond resolution for rate
          control and event timing.

     Event Queue Implementation and Performance
     ------------------------------------------

     One of the new features of the LANai is its interrupt timer.  The
     LANai supports an extremely fast context switch due to its separate
     system and user register sets.  This allows us to effectively
     manage events, such as a timeout, that are very short.

     An example of how this can be used is to implement reliable RPC
     messages within the LAN via UDP, without requiring TCP.  The LANai
     channel CRC allows a receiver to immediately determine whether or
     not an incoming packet has been damaged.  The source LANai can
     maintain a queue of pending RPCs and round-trip timers associated
     with them, retransmitting when a timer expires.

     The technique of application-layer framing in conjunction with RPC
     stenciling was already shown to provide a 900% improvement over the
     traditional UNIX-stack mechanisms.  But to ensure that an RPC once
     sent actually arrives undamaged requires both error detection and
     retransmission capabilities.

     The objective here is to allow cooperative parallel computing via
     RPC messages, where the responsibility for reliable delivery of a
     UDP/RPC message is taken off the hands of the host system and
     placed into the LAN.  This allows the application software to treat
     the LAN as if it were as reliable as a DMA transfer across a system
     bus.

     The LAN also needs reliable transmission for its internal
     management and control messages.  It is hoped that this facility
     will allow us to enforce within the LAN a very short retransmission
     round-trip timeout, and so achieve a substantial performance
     improvement.

     To that end an event queue has been implemented for the LANai chip.
     This is similar to the callout queue used in UNIX.  A list of
     events is maintained, sorted by ascending event time.  The
     interrupt timer fires when the nearest event times out.  As a
     result the procedure associated with that event is executed in
     system context.

Internet Monthly Report                                         May 1994


     Performance testing has demonstrated that the LANai event queue has
     an overhead of approximately 30 microseconds per event.  This
     includes all overhead to maintain the event queue, service the
     interrupt and call the associated event procedure.

     With 30 microseconds as the lower limit, rule of thumb suggests
     that retransmission timeouts can remain effective if they are as
     short as 50 microseconds.

MERIT/NSFNET ENGINEERING
------------------------

     This report summarizes recent activities of Merit's NSFNET Project
     Internet Engineering and Network Management groups.

     Merit held the first meeting of the NANOG (North American Network
     Operators Group) in Ann Arbor on June 2nd and 3rd.

     Susan Hares introduced preliminary transition plans and timelines
     for migration to the new NSFNET program.

     Merit anticipates that the NAPs and Route Servers will be in place
     by the end of July. Trials with Network Service Providers (NSPs)
     and Midlevel networks will begin during August. September and
     October should see the dual-connection of Regional Service
     Providers and subsequent detachment of networks from the current
     ANS/NSFNET backbone with a goal of November 1st for detaching 90%
     of the networks from the backbone. It is anticipated that only the

Internet Monthly Report                                         May 1994


     NSF Supercomputer sites may remain attached to the NSFnet backbone
     after November 1st.

     The first day also included discussion of the technical
     specifications for attaching to NAPs, the service offerings of NAP
     awardees and NAP network operations. The second day included a
     review of ATM testbed routing experiments, the Route Server Network
     Management Architecture and strategies, recent changes to the
     Policy Routing Data Base and Routing Regestries, and plans for
     future meetings.

     Testing of the PacBell ATM-NAP continues under Jessica Yu's
     leadership. The testbed is configured as:

                              Router Servers
                                    |
                                cisco/ADSU
                                    |
      testnet1<-->cisco/ADSU<-->ATM switch<-->cisco/ADSU<-->testnet2

     The tests have verified the feasibility of integrating the Route
     Server approach into an ATM-based NAP using currently available
     technologies and software implementations. Enke Chen attended an
     ATM Tutorial and explored ATM product offerings at Spring
     InterOP'94.

     Modifications to the Policy Routing Data Base (PRDB) continue in
     order to support the features of gated and CIDR. Recent changes
     include the removal of Fake ASs, support for Proxy Aggregation and
     acceptance of classless CIDR routes. FakeASs were removed for
     Alternet, CA*net, DSI, BARRnet and ESnet.

     The following table shows which AS numbers have been replaced.

               Old   New
     DSI        60  2699
               274  2699

     Merit also provides proxy aggregation for DSI which currently must
     use EGP.  Proxy aggregation for DSI reduces the number of unique
     DSI net numbers that must be carried in routing tables.

     Merit continues its work with NSF/ANSnet attached networks to
     support CIDR.  While only a relatively small number of ASs remain
     to switch to BGP4, the benefits of CIDR aggregation continue to
     accrue. During May approximately 2,083 specific routes were removed
     from the backbone routers in favor of CIDR aggregates. This
     decrease from 19,688 routes at the end of April to 17,605 at the
     end of May represents the second month of negative growth in the
     routing table size since the internet-wide deployment of CIDR.

     Elise Gerich and Laurent Joncheray attended the RIPE meeting in
     Amsterdam May 16th through 18th. Merit had proposed extensions to
     RIPE-81 which were discussed in the Routing WG meeting. General
     agreement on new attributes was reached and a revised RIPE document
     will be published.

     Merit Routing Registry tools are available for anonymous ftp from
     rrdb.merit.edu in the directory /pub/meritrr. You may address your
     comments and questions to rradmin@rrdb.merit.edu.

     Andy Adams will attend a NSF-sponsored workshop to address the
     instrumentation needs and design considerations for cross-platform
     interoperability in a federation of networked botanical specimen
     databases. The workshop will be at the University of California-
     Berkeley June 9th through the 12th.

     RIPE NCC Annual Report 1993 Daniel Karrenberg RIPE NCC Manager

     The RIPE Network Coordination Centre supports all Internet service
     providers in Europe.  The NCC is funded by the European Internet
     service providers.  RARE provides the formal framework for the NCC.

     The main activities center around European Internet coordination.
     The following graph shows the number of individual European
     Internet hosts registered in the domain name system for 1992 and
     1993.  The European Internet roughly doubles in size every year.

     The most visible activity of the NCC is the regional Internet
     registry whose task is the assignment of Internet network layer
     address space to European enterprises.  For this purpose a
     distributed system has been set up.  83 local registries operated
     by Internet service providers assign address space locally.  The
     NCC as regional registry delegates address space to the local
     registries, supports them and ensures that address space assignment

Internet Monthly Report                                         May 1994


     occurs in a fair and regular manner.  The NCC also deals with
     requests for large amounts of address space and requests from
     enterprises for which no appropriate local registry exists.  The
     European Internet registries have assigned 16871 network numbers
     during 1993.


     The RIPE NCC maintains the RIPE network management database
     containing information about IP networks, DNS domains, Routing
     Policies and the appropriate contact persons.  The number of
     entries in this database is shown in the graph below.  It has been

     become fully operational in September 1992.

During 1993 the NCC has totally re-designed and re-implemented the
update process for the database.  This is now fully automatic for almost
all updates.  During 1993 a total of 157004 updates has been processed.

The NCC also maintains the RIPE document store which stores all RIPE
documents and a host of related information.  It is accessible by the
classical Internet services, common resource discovery tools and from
the public X.25 networks.

During 1993 the NCC has been operating well within its budget.  The
unexpectedly low expenditure on travel is due to major meetings being
held in Amsterdam (IETF, RIPE meetings).

The NCC staffing level has been constant since the start of operations
in April 1992.  Due to the increased workload caused by the growth of
the European Internet more staff will be needed in 1994.

During 1993 the three special projects have been carried out at the NCC
under the RARE technical program.  The "European Route Server" and
"Generic Internet Service Description" projects have been concluded
successfully resulting in among other things a European route server
deployed at the GIX.  The PRIDE (Policy-Based Routing Implementation and
Deployment in Europe) project has started and resulted in a well
populated European routing registry as well as a first set of tools to
use the information in that registry.  PRIDE continues in 1994.  All
special projects are funded by interested parties separately from the
NCC core services.

For a detailed description of NCC activities see the NCC activity plan
produced by RIPE and the Quarterly Reports published by the NCC.  These
and other related documents are available from the RIPE document store
or directly from the NCC at <ncc@ripe.net> or +31 20 592 5065.
