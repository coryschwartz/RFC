INTERNET MONTHLY REPORTS
------------------------

The purpose of these reports is to communicate to the Internet Research
Group the accomplishments, milestones reached, or problems discovered by
the participating organizations.

Each organization is expected to submit a 1/2 page report on the first
business day of the month describing the previous month's activities.
These reports should be submitted via network mail to "IMR-ED@ISI.EDU".

`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

The Internet Monthly Report mailing list is now managed by MajorDomo at
ISI.EDU.  The announcements of new issues on the Internet Monthly Report
are sent to the IETF-Announce list and to this IMR list.

Requests to be ADDED or DELETED from the Internet Monthly report list
should be sent to "majordomo@isi.edu" with the message body either
"subscribe imr" or "unsubscribe imr".

Details on obtaining the current IMR, or back issues, via FTP or EMAIL
may be obtained by sending an EMAIL message to "rfc-info@ISI.EDU" with
the message body "help: ways_to_get_imrs".  For example:

        To: rfc-info@ISI.EDU
        Subject: getting imrs

     THE US DOMAIN REGISTRY

     The US Domain registration information is available online at
     http://www.isi.edu/us-domain.

     Much of the processing of the requests to the third level domain
     name is now automated. In particular, most requests to register
     names in localities already delegated are automatically forwarded
     to the administrator of that locality.

     Recent announcements:

        About a year ago we raised the possibility that it might be
        necessary to begin charging for delegations of locality names in
        the US domain.  It turns out that we have avoided that by
        obtaining further funding through 30-Sep-98.  And we have had
        discussions that will most likely lead to funding for the next
        year (Oct98 - Sep99) or more from the United States Postal
        Service (USPS).

        Since there has been some news about the USPS becoming involved
        in the US domain today we want to clarify the situation.  ISI
        will need some funds from a new source to continue management of
        the US domain after 30-Sep-98.  Brian Kahin (of the US
        Government, OSTP) introduced management people in the USPS to
        me, and we have had some positive meetings, and now have a
        general understanding that the USPS is interested in supporting
        our work on managing the US domain at ISI for the year Oct98 -
        Sep99 (and possibly additional years).  No contract as yet,
        though pre-contract paper work has been exchanged.

        It may be that in the long run nearly all the country codes will
        have some government influence acting on their management.
        Within the US, the USPS is a very unusualy organization in that
        it is not officially part of the government but an independent
        non-for-profit corporation, yet closely supervised by the
        government.  If the US Government told the IANA to allocate the
        US domain to some agency or another there could be a lot of
        worse choices.

        The USPS is trying to think of ways to provide additional
        services through the the US domain.  They've asked me to review
        some of these and there may be some ideas they haven't told me
        about yet.  One of the discussions is about ways to add branches
        to the US domain to make more desirable to businesses to use
        names in the US domain.  Another idea is that everyone with an
        address that the USPS can deliver physical mail to could




Ramos                                                          [Page 12]

Internet Monthly Report                                        June 1998


        automatically have an email address in the US domain.  I think
        this idea still needs a lot of work to understand all the
        implications both technically and socially.

        In managing the postal system the USPS is a very significant
        user of Internet technology.  The following is a brief
        description of some of their Internet capability.  The USPS
        provides the following information:

           "The Postal Service currently manages a large information
           systems network.  The USPS manages a class A license for IP
           addresses (56.X.X.X). Within the internal USPS network are 15
           autonomous systems, with 16 areas each, which provide service
           to up to 34,000 local area networks. When fully deployed, the
           USPS internal network will provide TCP/IP connectivity to
           over 150,000 individual networked devices. Within the
           usps.gov second level domain, the USPS has one primary and
           sixteen secondary domain name servers which currently handle
           over 125,000 individual host names. Because of the high
           bandwidth demands of the digital image traffic used in mail
           sorting, USPS networks have a total capacity equivalent to
           over 700 T1 lines.  Firewalls between the USPS intranet and
           the public Internet handle 1.5 million transactions per day
           at a peak rate of 140,000 transactions per hour, exchanging
           14 GB of data in the form of web pages and files. In
           addition, the USPS, as a non-profit government enterprise, is
           able to obtain the best technical expertise available from
           private industry through consulting and contracting
           arrangements. The USPS organizational structure and supplier
           outsoucing agreements currently in place can provide services
           within the existing .us TLD, and will scale readily to handle
           any growth in future demands."

UCL
----

     J Crowcroft and I Kouvelas attended the NOSSDAV workshop and gave
     papers on Self Organising Transcoders (we believe the first
     implementation of a self-organising mbone hierarchical
     application), and on Application Level Adaption using fuzzy logic
     decisions (not controllers!)

     The main authors of these papers, Isidor Kouvelas and Saleem Bhatti
     respectively, were conveniently awarded their PhDs in the same
     month.

     J Crowcroft attended the Smart Spaces workshop at Stanford
     sponsored by the Hewlett Packard Internet Research Institute and
     SICS.

     * New RFCs added to queue throughout the month

     The Requests for Comments (RFCs) are a series of notes, started in
     1969, about the Internet (originally the ARPANET). The notes
     discuss many aspects of computing and computer communication
     focusing in networking protocols, procedures, programs, and
     concepts, but also including meeting notes, opinion, and sometimes
     humor. The specification documents of the Internet protocol suite,
     as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and its
     steering group (the IESG), are published as RFCs.





Ramos                                                          [Page 18]

Internet Monthly Report                                        June 1998


     RFCs-to-be are edited by the RFC Editor.  RFCs enter the RFC
     Editor's work queue either by an action of the IESG or by
     independent submission.  Most independent submissions are referred
     to the IESG to check for overlap with IETF work.  The IESG might
     put a hold on a document to gather more input from its members.
     The wait for an RFC to be published varies as there can be
     unforeseen complications (typically editorial matters that need
     clarification from the author).  Documents can be removed from the
     publication queue if they are found to be insufficient or incorrect
     or if the IESG asks the author to join work already in progress in
     the IETF.
