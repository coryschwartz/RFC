business day of the month describing the previous month's activities.

These reports should be submitted via network mail to:

     Ann Westine Cooper (Cooper@ISI.EDU)

     NSF Regional reports - To obtain the procedure describing how to
     submit information for the Internet Monthly Report, send an email
     message to mailserv@is.internic.net and put "send imr-procedure" in
     the body of the message (add only that one line; do not put a
     signature).

Requests to be added or deleted from the Internet Monthly report list
should be sent to "imr-request@isi.edu".

     Details on obtaining the current IMR, or back issues, via FTP or
     EMAIL may be obtained by sending an EMAIL message to "rfc-
     info@ISI.EDU" with the message body "help: ways_to_get_imrs".  For
     example:

             To: rfc-info@ISI.EDU

     RESOURCE DISCOVERY AND DIRECTORY SERVICE
     ----------------------------------------

        The Internet Research Task Force Research Group on Resource
        Discovery (IRTF-RD) has made its Harvest software system
        available on the Internet.

        Harvest is an integrated set of tools to gather, extract,
        organize, search, cache, and replicate relevant information
        across the Internet.  With modest effort users can tailor
        Harvest to digest information in many different formats, and
        offer custom search services on the Internet.  Moreover, Harvest
        makes very efficient use of network traffic, remote servers, and
        disk space.

        We have built a number of content indexes with Harvest,
        including an index of AT&T's 1-800 phone numbers, an index of
        WWW home pages, and an index of over 24,000 Computer Science
        technical reports from around the world.

        We have been beta testing Harvest for four months, and starting
        today are making the software available on the Internet.  You
        can get to demonstrations, papers, software and documentation at
        http://harvest.cs.colorado.edu/.

     1. Let me remind everyone that the next IETF meeting will be in San
        Jose, California from December 5-9, and the Registration
        Reception will held on Sunday, December 4th. San Jose logistic
        information and draft agendas have already been sent to the IETF
        announcement list and made available via gopher and on the Web.

        The IETF meetings for 1995 are starting to firm up. The IETF
        will be meeting in Danvers, Massachusetts (a suburb of Boston)
        from April 3-7, 1995. The summer IETF meeting will be held in
        Stockholm, Sweden the week of July 17-21, 1995. Due to the
        meeting costs, the IETF attendance fee for the Stockholm meeting
        will be US$300.

        The final meeting for 1995 will be held in Dallas, Texas. Once
        all the arrangements have been made, notifications will be sent
        to the IETF Announcement list. Remember that information on
        future IETF meetings can be always be found in the file 0mtg-
        sites.txt which is located on the IETF shadow directories. This
        information can also be viewed from the IETF Home Page on the
        Web. The URL is:

INTERNET PROJECTS
-----------------

ANSNET/NSFNET BACKBONE ENGINEERING
----------------------------------

     Network Status Summary
     =======================

     ANSnet total packet traffic increased by about 14% in October '94.
     An increase in the ANSnet forwarding table size of 0.58% was
     observed during the month of October.


     August Backbone Traffic Statistics
     ==================================

     The total inbound packet count for the ANSnet (measured using SNMP
     interface counters) was 85,499,744,741 on T3 ENSS interfaces, up
     15.82% from September.  The total packet count into the network
     including all ENSS serial interfaces was 96,279,824,426 up 14.30%
     from September.


     Router Forwarding Table Statistics
     ==================================

     The maximum number of destinations announced to ANSnet during
     October was 18,886 up .58% from September.

     The number of network destinations configured for announcement to
     the ANSnet but never announced (silent nets) during October was
     19,877.

     BGP-4/CIDR Deployment Status
     ============================

     As of November 4th '94, we have observed the withdrawal of 9,261
     class based destinations from the ANSnet router forwarding tables
     that are now represented by 2,014 configured aggregates.  Among
     these configured aggregates:

           1,651 of these are top-level aggregates (not nested in
           another aggregate).

           1,270 of these are actively announced to ANSnet.

           990 of these have at least one subnet configured (the

           other 280 may be saving the Internet future subnet
           announcements).

           906 of these have resulted in the withdrawal of at
           least one configured more specific route.

           894 of these have resulted in the withdrawal of 50%
           of their configured more specific routes.

           837 of these have resulted in the withdrawal of most
           (80%+) of their more specific routes.

     For up-to-date information is available from merit.edu:
     pub/nsfnet/cidr/cidr_savings.

     For further details on these CIDR aggregates, see
     merit.edu:pub/nsfnet/cidr/nestings.announced for full listings.


     Routing Stability Measured on the T3 Network
     ============================================

     Internal routing stability measurements are made by monitoring
     short term disconnect times (disconnects of five minutes duration
     or less).  This is intended as a measure of overall system
     stability rather than complete connectivity.

     If all nodes are considered, October 1994 had the most instability
     ever recorded on ANSNET.  This is due to the criteria of
     considering stability to be the amount of time that 100% of ANSNET
     is not undergoing routing change and due mostly to a persistant
     problem with a single T1 circuit.  There were other problems, most
     notably an FDDI problem at the Hayward POP.  If the one node
     affected is excluded, October was approximately as stable as
     September.

     The problem circuit was an Ameritec leg of a T1 tail circuit
     provisioned through MCI which turned out to be a bad smartjack at
     the customer premise.  This caused a very high level of packet
     loss.

     node is excluded from the data, very little instability in the
     other nodes was evident.  Large packet bursts coupled with
     transient link outages induced some congestion problems as link
     utilizations grew to 60%+ on T3 links at the NY, DC, Chicago and
     Cleveland POPs.  These problems have been corrected by deploying

     Scalability

     This month, in preparation for analysis of DIS traffic
     characteristics during the STOW-Europe exercises, BBN investigated
     the issue of post-processing time synchronization among
     participating sites.  Sychronization of host clocks in distributed
     simulation affords two major benefits:

     1 - Application PDUs are being logged in a distributed manner by
     deploying a logging host at each site.  No single repository of all
     PDUs generated during the exercise will exist.  Therefore, in order
     to enable an accurately sequenced after-action review, we will need
     to have a way to ensure consistency among time stamps on the
     separately logged PDUs.

     2 - Time synchronization among hosts exchanging data during the
     exercise will provide us with measurements of one-way end-to-end
     delay.  These measurements will give us a baseline of DSI



Cooper                                                         [Page 11]

     performance against which to measure improvement afforded by future
     communications architectures, and they will enable us to calibrate
     network simulators used to predict performance of the DSI in the
     presence of distributed simulation traffic.

     We are investigating the applicability of tools developed by Greg
     Troxel (BBN) as part of his Ph.D. work at MIT.  These tools enable
     us to correct for clock differences after the fact, even, to some
     extent, when no attempt at real-time synchronization (for example,
     running NTP) was being made.  If NTP is used during the exercise,
     Greg's tools will be even more effective at correcting for
     inaccuracies that might have resulted from asymmetric delays.  Greg
     has been refining and testing his programs and analysis techniques
     during September and October, and next month we expect to be
     applying them to STOW-E data.

     Flow Synchronization Protocol

     Over the past two months we prepared for and presented a
     demonstration of flow synchronization across the Internet.  The two
     main issues we tackled were porting the synchronization code to
     new, more powerful platforms (Sparc 10s and SS 20's) and
     interoperability between video flows and music flows for
     synchronization. We added to our software a Graphical User
     Interfaces and other tools to facilitate use and development.

     Regarding video and music interoperability, previous tests
     addressed only the synchronization of video streams with voice
     streams.  Since synchronizing multiple music streams has special
     requirements in the ways it adapts delays, it became necessary to
     create a version of the video software tailored to the music
     requirements.

     On October 20th, 1994, we became the first research group to
     demonstrate topology-independent tight synchronization of
     multimedia flows over wide area networks using the Internet and
     geographically dispersed sites across the continental US.

     The public demonstration, at the ACM Multimedia 94 Conference, San
     Francisco, consisted of synchronizing three music audio flows and a
     video flow from sites in Boston and San Francisco playing a Hayden
     piano Trio in G major.  The set up served to demonstrate audio-
     video synchronization and tight audio-audio synchronization among
     the flows from the players.  The audience on site and through the
     Mbone was shown the contrast between unsynchronized and
     synchronized flows.

     The live players were Martha Steenstrup (BBN) in Boston and Eve

     Schooler (Cal Tech, formerly at ISI) in San Francisco.  We used a
     piano recording to act as a "conductor" or metronome.  Its sound
     was delivered at the same time to both players, who played along on
     keyboards the parts of the other two instruments (cello, violin).
     The piano recording was also delivered to a repeater site.  All
     three music flows plus motion video from Martha Steenstrup in
     Boston were sent and played out synchronized at the demo room in
     San Francisco.

     The synchronization protocol used for this demonstration was
     developed with ARPA funding.  It made use of the Network Time
     Protocol to obtain clock synchronization, and it used Nevot for
     audio flows and PVP to NV for the video flow.  Synchronization to
     within a few tens of milliseconds or better is necessary for music
     synchronization in this demo.

     We also demonstrated a Graphics User Interface for the protocol
     use, built as an extension of the Nevot Graphics User Interface.
     During regular operation, it simply calls for a button to set or
     unset synchronization.  For experimentation and testing, it allows
     protocol parameters to be set and protocol delays to be displayed
     and tracked.

CSUNET
------

     In order to provide regional connectivity for the Pacific Internet
     Consortium (CSUnet, Los Nettos, WestREN) for southern California,
     CSUnet and Los Nettos requested MCInet networking services be
     ordered by WestREN/BARRnet.  The northern California portion is
     already in place and undergoing testing.

     MCInet expects to provide the southern California connectivity at
     the end of November.  CSUnet and Los Nettos will begin testing and
     expect to cutover production traffic to the new connection as soon
     as it is stable.

     Performance Testing of TCP/IP Protocol Suite
     --------------------------------------------

     We have compared some experimental implementations of optimized
     TCP/IP in the ATOMIC LAN environment.  Here we present the results
     of a fast-TCP compared to "as-shipped" TCP.  We compared the
     transmission of 4,096 byte packets (with 40-byte headers) between
     two SPARC2 workstations, using an optimized TCP and TCP as-shipped,
     with IP checksumming both enabled and disabled.  In addition we
     measured the performance of loopback taking place at various levels
     in the protocol stack using both SPARC20 and SPARC10 workstations.

     For these comparisons we used Myricom's implementation of the
     ATOMIC host interfaces.  There were two versions of the interface
     available: the first supported only programmed I/O, and the second
     had integrated DMA and hardware IP checksum.  The performance
     measures for the former were performed at ISI, and the latter were
     performed at ISI by Myricom.

     We measured different kernel buffer size areas over host-host,
     loopback at the Mosaic interface, and loopback above the Atomic
     driver, at the IP level in the kernel.

     TCP between two hosts runs at 25 Mbps on a Sparc-2, regardless of
     whether the optimized implementation or as-shipped was used.
     Turning off the IP checksum increased the rate to 29 Mbps.

     Mosaic loopback performed less well, because a single host was
     involved in both the send and receive functions.  We expected the
     useful bandwidth would drop to half the host-host rates, and this
     was verified.

     We performed a kernel loopback, to measure the protocol processing
     overhead independent of the cost of the data movement.  We expected
     the as-shipped TCP to become approximately five times faster (100

     instructions per TCP header + 1000 instructions per context switch
     + 4000 instructions for programmed I/O = 5100 instructions, which
     drops to 1100 without the data movement).  We also expected this to
     be an upper-bound on the speed of the protocol in DMA-mode, which
     newer ATOMIC boards from Myricom support.

     We found that the as-shipped TCP increased to 24 Mbps (30 without
     checksum).  This is only a factor of two increase, back to values
     seen for host-host transfers.  The optimized TCP was more sensitive
     to kernel buffer sizes, ranging 35-55 Mbps (50-100 without
     checksum).  The non-checksum case is a fair measure of the
     bandwidth, because checksumming can occur in parallel with data
     movement at low cost.  The optimized non-checksum TCP was increased
     by a factor of four, which is within our estimate.

     The kernel loopback of the as-shipped TCP on the Sparc-10 was
     nearly as effective as the optimized TCP on the Sparc-2.  We
     measured 45-50 Mbps (50-70 without checksum).

     In conjunction with Myricom, we measured the performance of the
     Sparc-2 TCP versions on a DMA-capable ATOMIC interface.  We
     expected to see performance near the kernel loopback values,
     because the DMA transfers can be overlapped with other operations.
     We found the as-shipped TCP host-host bandwidth was 40 Mbps (45
     with checksumming in hardware, which is nearly equivalent to
     "checksumming off").  The optimized TCP achieved 45 Mbps (70 with
     hardware checksumming).  These results verified our predictions.

     We conclude that some of the optimizations we tested are useful,
     but did not fully utilize the board capabilities of 440 Mbps
     through the DMA channel.  We believe that there is a potential for
     a 2- to 3-fold increase by hardware modifications, but that the
     preponderance of speedup potential is in the operating system.

     ATOMIC-2
     --------

     The ATOMIC-2 project extends the results of the ATOMIC, which
     developed a LAN from supercomputer chips. ATOMIC-2 was originally
     charged with augmenting the ATOMIC LAN lab prototypes into a
     production office environment, replacing the Ethernet LAN in the
     entire HPCC Division of ISI, and developing a number of host
     interfaces. Myricom was formed to commercialize the ATOMIC LAN, and
     so the ATOMIC-2 project has been redirected to address LAN
     interconnection over WAN ranges, integrated service issues, and
     network peripherals. All subsequent ATOMIC-2 work will be link-

     compatible with Myricom's Myrinet.

     We are currently developing an ATOMIC-ATM IP-level gateway. We are
     also developing an ATOMIC network disk server. We are continuing
     efforts to deliver a significant portion of ATOMIC's 640 Mbps
     network bandwidth to the user application, subject to host
     backplane limitations.

     We are serving as an alpha test-site for Myricom's production
     software.

     PC-ATOMIC
     ---------

     Design of 486-based VL-Bus ATOMIC interface.

     We completed the PC-ATOMIC prototype card, a i486 VL-Bus (VESA)
     interface supporting channel-level compatibility with the Myrinet
     LAN.  The card supports programmed I/O reads at 88 Mbps and writes
     at 144 Mbps. It also supports DMA, currently under testing.  The
     board has hardware support for IP checksums during either DMA or
     programmed I/O.  The checksum is performed during reads or writes,
     with zero overhead, and can be enabled via a control register bit.

     The communications interface has been tested, and found to have
     zero errors over 10 million packets in, on-board pre-driver
     loopback, on-board post-driver loopback, i486-i486, and i486 to
     MyriCom S-Bus interface. All tests involved zero errors over 10
     million packets.

     A limited number of these boards will be available shortly in small
     quantities.

     In addition, we have performed some experiments regarding the
     programmed-I/O bandwidth capabilities of the PC-ATOMIC boards,
     including a comparison to Myricom's 2.x SPARC S-Bus interface
     cards.

     Graphs show read (from host to board) and write (from board to
     host) programmed I/O bandwidth. Note that the READ bandwidth is
     more critical because it is the bottleneck in programmed I/O mode.

     RSVP PROJECT
     ============

     RSVP (ReserVation Protocol) and traffic control, as well as the
     MBONE, were demonstrated at the ACM Multimedia '94 Conference in
     San Francisco.  This demo was accomplished by a collaboration of
     researchers at ISI, MIT, PARC, UDEL, and LBL.  A number of vendors
     provided equipment in support of this demo: Sun, HP, DEC, and SGI
     provided workstations, and Fore provided ATM switches.  PAC Bell
     provided the DS3 line from the hotel to a BAGNET switch in an
     Oakland central office, and BAGNET provided a dedicated PVC from
     there to Palo Alto.

     The demo used an unloaded DS3 link (using ATM, as described later)
     between the conference network and a DARTnet router (Sparc) at
     PARC.  RSVP and traffic control were running in DARTnet.  DARTnet
     was flooded with background traffic, causing speech carried by VAT
     to be broken up in the absence of RSVP reservations, but clear with
     RSVP reservations in place.

     The DARTnet routers were running a SunOS kernel that included a
     packet scheduler implementing a simple subset of the CSZ service
     model.  Specifically, it implemented two levels of Predictive
     service, essentially two priority levels.  The routers also ran the
     ISI implementation of RSVP, which was invoked through modified VAT
     modules.

             An HP workstation connected the show Ethernet to a
             Fore Switch in the hotel.  The Fore switch drove a DS3
             line to a BAGNET switch in Oakland.  The little cells
             then traversed BAGNET to Palo Alto, where they crossed
             a short hop to a BADLAN switch within PARC.  The
             BADLAN switch was then connected to an ATM card in the
             DARTnet test host THa.  This provided an unloaded,
             high speed path from DARTnet to the show Ethernet.
             The intermediate switches did not run RSVP or traffic

        AMES:  DARTnet router at NASA Ames.

             Traffic generators T1 and T2 at other DARTnet sites not
             shown each sent about 800Kb/s of UDP junk traffic to
             sink at PARC THb. The result was to saturate the link
             marked X towards MM 94; measurement tools showed link X
             loaded very close to its full capacity of 1.344Mbps.

     The link marked Y leads to the rest of DARTnet, including ISI and
     MIT, which were multicasting VAT audio traffic towards MM 94.  This
     traffic collided with the background traffic from T1 and T2 in the
     AMES router, in the output driver for link X.  Basically the packet
     scheduling kernel established two output queues, one for reserved
     traffic and one for the rest.

     The mm94 machine was running a version of VAT that not only invoked
     RSVP, but also had a "big button" that could disable or enable RSVP
     for the demo.  With RSVP invoked, Resv messages were traveling from
     mm94 upstream through DARTnet towards all the senders that were
     sending Path messages downstream (in this case, MIT and ISI).  This
     caused the packet scheduler in the AMES router to give the VAT
     stream higher priority than the background traffic.

     In addition to the VAT reservation, there was a (small) reservation
     established for RSVP traffic, so that Path and Resv messages also
     used the high-priority queue.  This demo made extensive use of the
     automatic tunneling capability of RSVP.

MERIT/NSFNET ENGINEERING
------------------------

     This report summarizes recent activities of Merit's Internet
     Engineering and Network Management groups with regard to the NSFNET
     Backbone Service Project and the Routing Arbiter Project.

     Bill Norton and Enke Chen continue implementation of the Network
     Management System for the Routing Arbiter architecture. The
     distributed architecture will support bilingual SNMP (V1/V2), out-
     of-band access and router discovery algorithms. Laurent Joncheray
     has ported PGP ('Pretty Good Privacy') 2.6 into the RIPE routing
     registry software. PGP is a public key encryption method which
     provides for authentication of the sender of a message and,
     optionally, encryption of the message contents.  PGP is being
     evaluated by the RIPE team as one method for securing Routing
     Registry databases.

     Andy Adams and Rick Riolo of Merit, in collaboration with Cengiz
     Alaettinoglu of ISI, have implemented a RIPE-181 policy language
     analysis library that parses RIPE-181 policy syntax and makes
     queries to the Routing Arbiter Database to produce output such as
     AS lists and net lists. The output is suitable for all sorts of
     configuration file formats, in addition to the Route Server's
     configuration files.

     The routines will also be very useful for policy analysis, both for
     the Routing Arbiter's use and for others.  For example, the code
     can be used to normalize and compare policy expressions or minimize
     policy expressions.  The code could parse a complex policy in
     RIPE-181 syntax and output an equivalent, more compact expression,
     such as 'Accept ANY'.  If this was not the intended meaning, the
     developer could redo the policy to express the correct meaning.
     Other network providers have shown interest in using this code, in
     the form of libraries, to generate their own configuration files.

     Merit hosted the North America Network Operators Group (NANOG)
     meeting on October 24th and 25th. The focus of the meeting was the
     transition from an NSFNET-provided backbone service to an
     architecture based on Network Access Points for multiple backbone
     providers. Elise Gerich updated the group on the NSFNET transition
     and on the migration from the Policy Routing Data Base (PRDB) to a
     Global Routing Registry. The Routing Arbiter panel of Bill Manning
     (ISI), Yakov Rekhter (IBM) and Elise Gerich answered questions
     concerning different aspects of the collaborative project. John
     Scudder presented an NSFNET traffic analysis with projected NAP
     traffic loads, which was based on work by Scudder and Sue Hares.

     Curtis Villamizar (ANS) presented results from the joint ANS-
     Bellcore NAP testbed and a study on TCP performance. Paul Vixie
     (vix.com) discussed DNS security considerations. Peter Lothberg
     introduced the European Operator's Forum and the interconnectivity
     of its principal participants. Yakov Rekhter (IBM) provided an
     update on CIDR aggregation. Sean Doran (Sprint) discussed their
     backbone reengineering.  Andy Schmidt (Ameritech) discussed their
     NAP Laboratory. The San Francisco NAP status, testbed results and
     future ATM/NAP plans were presented by PacBell representatives
     Frank Liu, Al Broscius and Chin Yuan. Tim Salo (Minnesota
     Supercomputer Center and SPRINT-NAP Co-PI) discussed ATM
     implementation problems and future directions.

     Several of the presented papers, the NANOG charter, meeting minutes
     and related documents are available on the Merit-IE World Wide Web
     server RA Info page, http://www.ra.net/rainfo.html and/or for
     anonymous FTP from merit.edu in the directory
     /pub/nanog/presentations.

     A recurrent problem on the ANS/NSFNET backbone has involved the
     dropping of BGP peer sessions with midlevel network peers. The
     problem was particularly evident during the twice-weekly GateD
     reconfigurations. The configuration files are fairly large and
     primarily composed of statements controlling the export of routing
     information to the midlevel peers. Since many of the midlevels are
     learning many of these routes from other midlevel peers at the same
     ENSS, it is not necessary for them to also receive these routes
     from the ENSSs. At ENSS 136, the problem became acute with a
     configuration file of over 120,000 lines. By working with the ENSS
     136 peers we were able to initially remove 5,000 lines with more to
     follow. Merit also has begun work with peers of ENSSs 144 and 145,
     which also have large configuration files and many peering
     sessions. By working with these peers, and especially NSI as it
     migrated from EGP to BGP and consolidated into a single AS, almost
     20,000 lines were removed from the ENSS 144 configuration file.

     These changes should improve overall routing performance and reduce
     problems seen during routing updates. If you peer with other
     networks at these or other primary ENSSs, please consider a review
     of your AS policies to help us eliminate redundant network
     announcements.

     Merit staff are also continuing work with midlevel networks to
     promote CIDR aggregation of their routing announcements. Several
     files on current aggregation status are maintained for anonymous
     FTP from merit.edu in the directory /pub/nsfnet/cidr. The
     configured and announced aggregates, potential aggregates and
     potential savings are all available. The information and related
     charts and tools are available on the Merit-IE World Wide Web
     server; http://www.ra.net/home.html is the entry point to the web
     collection.

     Version 1.0 of the InterDomain Routing Protocol implementation for
     the FAA has been released. This release provides a fully functional
     and hopefully stable IDRP implementation. Gated-IDRP version 1.1,
     which supports more advanced policy descriptions, will be available
     shortly.  Version 1.0 is available for anonymous FTP from merit.edu
     in the file /pub/iso/idrp/faa/gated-idrp-1.0.tar.Z . The FAA is
     funding this research on advanced features of IDRP in GateD as a
     cooperative effort of the FAA, Merit and MITRE Corporation.

     Jessica Yu and Enke Chen hosted a delegation from CERNet, the
     Chinese National Education and Research Network, on October 31.
     The program included presentations by Merit's President Eric
     Aupperle, Elise Gerich, Bill Norton, Sheri Repucci, and Jessica Yu.
     Merit staff shared their experiences with building MichNet and the
     NSFNET backbone.  The Chinese delegation presented its engineering
     plan to build a national, research and education, TCP/IP-based
     network to serve the 1,093 universities in China.

     ii) Policy Based Traffic Management - This will provide a language
     and associated tools for specifying policy which can be used to
     modify the behaviour of automated manager agents to enable them to
     deal with network congestion in real-time.

     iii) Quality of Service Management - this will permit multi-media,
     application specific QoS requirements to be specified and mapped
     onto the required support mechanisms in the underlying services.

     iv) Traffic Monitoring and Measurement - distributed traffic
     monitoring using statistical algorithms will be provided as well as
     a traffic source based on a multi-bitrate video and audio service
     to evaluate performance.

     v) Security - an architecture for assuring secure and authenticated
     signalling will be developed, as well as a unified approach for
     authenticating end-user traffic flows based on virtual channels.
