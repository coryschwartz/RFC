Review Utrecht workshop (brief, as there is an IETF BOF for this)
-------------------------------
Local hosting was excellent; sincere thanks to Erik Huizer et al.

List of recommendations (preliminary, see workshop report for complete set):
+ Consider adopting a new end-point namespace, especially for IPSEC.
+ Develop the RSIP mechanism (realm-specific IP addresses) as an alternative
to network address translation.
+ Continue effort to deploy IPv6, as a migration path from NAT/RSIP.
+ >Make automatic IPv6 renumbering work.
+ Deploy DNS Security as soon as possible, but otherwise refrain from
modifying DNS beyond current plans.
+ Consider new API at a higher level of abstraction than TCP/IP sockets 
(e.g. open by name rather than by address).
===============================

Review IAB work items
-------------------------------
Major work items to focus on going forward:
	+ mobility and wireless
	+ agreement that need to increase general level of security awareness in 
IETF, but does not presently require IAB action
	+ overall QOS architecture
	+ "directories": DNS, LDAP, etc.--architect directory with necessary 
functions (publish/subscribe, etc.)
===============================

Prepare for Simpson appeal hearing
-------------------------------
Geoff Huston was recently appointed chair of the ISOC Board of Trustees, 
which is next stop in I* appeal process. Thus, Geoff has recused himself 
from IAB consideration of this matter.

IAB will meet directly after the appeal hearing for first-round discussion. 
Official IAB response will be published as soon as reasonably possible 
thereafter.
===============================

Boilerplate in Internet Drafts
-------------------------------
We need to be much clearer about what is contributed into standards 
process, with rights and responsibilities associated with that, vs. 
personal contributions that are not going to be considered by working 
groups. Need to also be clear about IP rights associated with putting 
things into the standards track. Should be taken to Poisson Working Group.
===============================

Prepare for open meeting
-------------------------------
RFC Editor report.
Open mike.
===============================

Plan BOF coverage for the week
-------------------------------
===============================

PSO and IANA MoUs
-------------------------------
Goal is that PSO MoU will be signed this week (possibly at end of plenary).
===============================

Future Meetings
-------------------------------
Regular teleconference second Tuesday of the month at 10:00 AM Eastern Time.
