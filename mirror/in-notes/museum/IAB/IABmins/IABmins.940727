MINUTES FOR JULY 27 1994 IAB OPEN MEETING AT TORONTO IETF

The open meeting of the Internet Architecture Board at the Toronto IETF
opened with a report on the status of the liaison with SC6 by Christian
Huitema.  The "Proposed Cooperative Agreement" is almost complete, with
only one issue still to be resolved.  Christian then mentioned the request
from the ISOC board of trustees to the IAB to devise a "code of ethics" for
the Internet community.

Brian Carpenter presented a report on "External (Mis)Perceptions of
IETF/IESG/IAB/ISOC."  He has been polling people inside and outside the
Internet community to learn what the image is of these organizations.  In
summary, he has heard from some people that the IETF standards process is
too informal, from others that it is too formal, and from a few that it is
ineffective. The internationalism of the ISOC and IETF is viewed as
inadequate. Some people view IETF standards as non-authoritative and the
IETF/IESG/IAB as self-perpetuating with closed vision. The activities of
the IAB and IESG are poorly understood both inside and outside the IETF.
ISOC has over-emphasized political correctness and Internet hype, but has
overlooked outreach to IETF and staff engineers.  Regarding the issue of
the internationalism of the IETF, it was suggested that there be more IETF
meetings outside of the United States.  It was not clear that non-US
locations would be as cost effective for attendees, but it might address
the perception that the IETF is primarily a US-centric organization.  An
Internet draft will be published shortly that details the comments received
and outlines some suggestions for improvements.

Next, Steve Crocker gave an update on the POISED process.  A question
raised during discussion was whether there is anything that is outside the
purview of the IETF.  Also, the statement was made that much of the focus
on openness and process is less important than the technology--the reason
that TCP/IP has proven so popular is that the technology works.

There was then a prolonged discussion about the fact that some working
groups are not working and that some people are choosing to not bring
technology to the IETF because of certain aspects of the IETF culture.
Possible causes for these problems are that people can't be removed from
working groups and members are not held accountable.  One suggestion to fix
this within the current structure is to have strong WG chairs and area
directors.  Some members of the IAB voiced the strong opinion that the IESG
area directors should take stronger steps to manage the process.  The area
directors can and should take a strong role in managing working groups
(e.g., by policing the charters and instructing working group chairs on
their rights and responsibilities in running meetings).

Another statement that triggered debate is that it's important to have a
clear vision of what the goal is and to understand how the work within the
IETF is working toward reaching the goal. It was felt that the IAB should
clearly define the architecture so that the IESG, IETF and the working
groups can engineer the solutions to fulfill the vision.

Christian Huitema then presented a talk "Follow-on to the Security
Workshop."  He announced that the IAB, in its meeting on Sunday July 24,
had developed a statement encouraging the IETF to develop security for the
Internet:

"The IAB calls on the IETF to develop standards that provide security
(confidentiality, authentication and integrity) for communication over the
Internet.  The framework must make provision for multiple encryption
algorithms, but should specify a single common (strong) method.
Consideration of export controls is outside of the purview of the IETF."

The talk evoked a plea from the audience:  the workshop report looked good
and provided a nice perspective on a few topics, but the report is no
substitute for the IAB providing an end-to-end top-to-bottom architecture
for Internet security.  This raised the question whether the  PSRG is
documenting such an architecture.  There is a document, currently 178 pages
long, but a lot is still in outline form.  It will (soon?) be released as
an Internet draft, but first it needs experts from the areas to help fill
in the protocol-specific parts.  There was strong encouragement from some
quarters for near term release of the document to the larger community for
discussion and input.

John Romkey announced plans for the next IAB workshop, to focus on
"Information Infrastructure."  There is a call for white papers, which
appears below:

IAB Information Infrastructure Workshop
Call For White Papers

The Internet Architecture Board is sponsoring an "Information
Infrastructure" workshop Oct. 12-14, 1994 at an east coast site in the
United States still to be determined.

This workshop is intended to explore architectural issues involved in
various information applications and systems currently being used on
the Internet, including the World Wide Web, Gopher, Mosaic, archie and
WAIS. The workshop will emphasize common architectural issues such as:
        naming
        caching
        type conversion
        security issues (privacy, authorization, authentication,...)
        replication
        resource location
        integration with directory services
        accounting
        encoding
        longevity

Participation in IAB-sponsored workshops is by invitation.
Traditionally, attendees are IAB members, IESG area directors
concerned with the subjects, and selected experts from IETF working
groups and IRTF research groups. In order to solicit new perspectives
in this area, the IAB invites interested parties to submit a one to
two page white paper analyzing a specific architectural problem with
architectural suggestions for solutions.  Please email white papers to
ii-white-papers@ELF.Com by August 31. They can also be sent as
hardcopy to John Romkey, ELF Communications, 1770 Massachusetts Ave.
#331, Cambridge, MA 02140, USA.

Note that the number of places is very limited - there is no guarantee
that we can invite all those who submit. But in any case, your
comments will be taken into account during the workshop!
