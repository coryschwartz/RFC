INTRODUCTION

        This  is a guide to implementations and products associated with
the Department of  Defense  (DoD)  Defense  Data  Network  (DDN)  TCP/IP
protocols.    It is published for informational purposes only by the DDN
Network Information Center (NIC) at SRI International on behalf  of  the
Defense  Data  Network Program Management Office (DDN PMO) and in no way
endorses or officially recommends any implementation or product  on  the
part  of  the  Defense Communications Agency (DCA), the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the NIC or DoD.  It is  not  complete.
Omission  of  any  vendor or implementor has no significant implication,
other than that  the  NIC  has  no  information  about  that  vendor  or
implementor,  or  that  the information was not available at the time of
this printing.  Likewise, only completed fields of the product templates
are  included,  and unfilled fields have been deleted to conserve space.
Anyone planning to use either a product or an implementation is urged to
do  their  own  investigation  of the details, costs, and support of the
product.


        This guide is  divided  into  software  implementations  (listed
alphabetically  by  machine  type)  and hardware implementations (listed
alphabetically by company).  The guide  is  also  indexed  by  operating
system, with the machine type listed under each and by company name.


        Vendors  who  wish  to  have  their  TCP/IP  products tested and
certified for use on the DDN should contact  Code  B617,  the  Test  and
Evaluation Branch of the DDN PMO for details.


        Throughout  the  document, references are made to RFCs and IENs.
RFCs, or  Requests  for  Comments,  are  network  technical  notes  used
primarily  to  introduce proposed internet protocols and related network
topics to the DDN.  IENs, or Internet  Experiment  Notes,  are  Internet
Working  Group technical notes.  Both RFCs and IENs are available on the
SRI-NIC host.  You  may  obtain  copies  of  either  by  using  the  FTP
facility,  if it is available at your host.  Connect to the SRI-NIC host
[10.0.0.51 or 26.0.0.73] and log in as ANONYMOUS with GUEST as password.
RFC  filenames are of the format RFC:RFCxxx.TXT (where xxx is the number
of the RFC) and IENs are of the format IEN:IEN-xxx.TXT (where xxx is the
number of the IEN -- note the dash in the IEN filename.)

        Online copies of the guide are available through FTP in the file
named NETINFO:TCP-IP-IMPLEMENTATIONS.TXT.  For those who are not on  the
network, contact the DDN Network Information Center to request copies of
RFCs, IENs or this guide by calling our toll-free number 1-800-235-3155.

1. TCP/IP SOFTWARE IMPLEMENTATIONS BY MACHINE TYPE

1.1. APPLE



1.1.1. v STANFORD ETHERNET APPLETALK GATEWAY
PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:        STANFORD   ETHERNET   APPLETALK  GATEWAY
(SEAGATE)

TYPE:    Gateway

DESCRIPTION:

       SEAGATE is a gateway (Apple term: bridge)  that  connects  an
    Ethernet   using   the   internet   protocols,  to  an  applebus
    (AppleTalk) using Apple or IP protocols.  The IP protocol family
    was  chosen  because  many  campuses  and engineering groups are
    using it on their Ethernets; most such  groups  have  access  to
    Berkeley  UNIX.    With  such  a  gateway  in  place, it becomes
    possible  to  create  UNIX  server  daemons  to  provide   file,
    printing, mail, etc. services for the Macintoshes.

       In  addition,  it  would  be possible for the UNIX systems to
    become integrated into a Macintosh Office such that  UNIX  users
    could  access  Apple-provided  services  such  as  printing on a
    LaserWriter or sending mail to Macintosh users via an Apple file
    server.

       This distribution of SEAGATE provides all the information and
    software you should need to setup your own gateway.  Please bear
    in  mind  that  this distribution is not 'supported' and that we
    can't give extensive help about the mechanics  of  putting  your
    gateway  together.    I  would like to hear about bug reports or
    enhancements however.

       To assemble your own gateway, you  will  need  at  least  the
    items below:

       - The  hardware  is a 3 card multibus system:  A 'SUN' 68000
         CPU  board,  an  Interlan  NI3210  Ethernet  card,  and  a
         homebrew  applebus  card  (about  8  chips) which takes an
         afternoon to wirewrap.

       - A UNIX (usually VAX) running 4.2 BSD, 4.1 BSD  or  Eunice.
         This  is  because the source distributed is written in the
         PCC/MIT 68000 C compiler.   [This  is  the  same  compiler
         included  with  the  SUMACC  Mac C cross development kit.]
         You can probably make due with  any  68K  C  compiler  and
         assembler, but it will be harder.

       - Inside   Mac,   update   service,  and  the  Mac  software
                                   3



         supplement.

       - Applebus Developer's  Kit,  includes:    protocol  manual,
         applebus  taps  and  interconnecting  cable,  Mac applebus
         drivers on SONY disks.

       - Dartmouth's    IP    package     from     Mark     Sherman
         (mss%dartmouth@CSNET-relay).    The  gateway  distribution
         includes the binary for TFTP, but if you  want  the  whole
         package (and source), you should get it from Mark.

       - A  Lisa Workshop system is handy to have around; you would
         need it to compile Mark's sources.  Even if you are  doing
         development  in  C,  Apple  releases Applebus updates as a
         combination of Mac and Lisa disks.  The Mac disks  contain
         the  'driver'  binary  resources.   The Lisa disks contain
         source for header files.

       The current software on the Macintosh is the IP TFTP program.
    As  mentioned  above,  the  gateway  also  has the capability to
    translate Apple DDP datagrams into IP UDP  datagrams,  and  vice
    versa.    We  are now writing some UNIX (user-level) UDP daemons
    that directly provide AppleTalk ATP services (such  as  external
    file system access.)

       Using  Mark  Sherman's  (Dartmouth) TFTP and the Berkeley 4.2
    BSD TFTP daemon, we made some simple timings.  On the Mac  side,
    TFTP used a ramdisk to avoid any delays induced by the slow SONY
    drive.  For a UNIX to Mac transfer, we found that the  Mac  took
    43 ms between data received and ack sent, while UNIX spent 25 ms
    between ack received and next data sent.

       Most of the transfer occurred at 512 data bytes every 70ms  =
    7314 bytes/sec = 58K baud.

       Note  however  that  the  IP  TFTP  protocol  is just that, a
    'trivial' FTP.  It is purely half-duplex in  nature.    When  we
    start  using  Apple's  ATP, which can stream several packets per
    acknowledgement,  it  should  boost  throughput   significantly.
    Gursharan  Sidhu  tells  me  that  their  process-to-process (no
    disks) ATP throughput is 180K baud (out of the 230K available on
    the  cable).   This is very good, considering many TCP's running
    on 10 megabit Ethernet are lucky to get a few  hundred  kilobits
    of throughput.

DOCUMENTATION:

       On [SUMEX]<info-mac> the files are:

    seagate.ms    documentation in -ms format
    seagate.hard  the wirelist for the applebus interface
    seagate.shar1 the main gateway sources (including above docs)
                                   4



    seagate.shar2 the ddt, dlq, testscc, and tftp subdirectories

       All  these  files are plain ASCII and can be FTP'd from SUMEX
    with the 'anonymous' login.  The two shar (shell archive)  files
    are  each  about  170K  bytes,  so we would appreciate it if you
    would avoid transfers during 9 AM to 5 PM PST.

1.2. BOLT, BERANEK AND NEWMAN



1.2.1. BBN-C/70
PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:   BBN-C/70

TYPE:   TCP/IP Implementation

DESCRIPTION:

       The  C/70  processor  is  a BBN-designed system with a native
    instruction set oriented toward executing the C  language.    It
    supports  UNIX  Version 7 and provides for user processes with a
    20-bit address space.  The TCP/IP implementation  for  the  C/70
    was  ported  from  the  BBN  VAX  TCP/IP,  and shares all of its
    features.  This version of TCP/IP is running  experimentally  at
    BBN,  but  is  still  under  development.  Performance tuning is
    underway, to make it more  compatible  with  the  C/70's  memory
    management system.

1.2.2. BBN-GATEWAYS
TYPE:   TCP/IP Implementation

DESCRIPTION:

       In  an  effort  to  provide  improved service in the gateways
    maintained at BBN,  a  new  gateway  implementation  written  in
    MACRO-11  instead  of  BCPL  has  been  developed.  The MACRO-11
    gateway  provides  users   with   internet   service   that   is
    functionally  equivalent  to  that  provided by the current BCPL
    gateways with the following exceptions:

       - Packets with options will be fragmented if necessary.

       - ICMP protocol is supported.

       - The gateway sends Time Exceeded, Parameter Problem,  Echo,
         Information Request, Destination Unreachable, and Redirect
         ICMP messages.

       - Initially, Source Quench and Timestamp packets will not be
         supported.

       - Class  A, B, and C Network Address formats as specified in
         the  September  1981   Internet   Protocol   Specification
         (RFC791) are supported.

       The  gateway  contains  an  internetwork debugger (XNET) that
    allows the gateway to be examined while it is running.    Buffer
    space is greatly expanded to provide better throughput.  ARPANET
    RFNMs are counted so the gateway  will  not  send  more  than  8
    outstanding messages to an ARPANET host.

1.7. DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORPORATION



1.7.1. BRL GATEWAY
PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:   BRL Gateway

TYPE:    TCP/IP Implementation

DESCRIPTION:

       The BRL Gateway is a total redesign.  None  of  the  original
    MIT  code  was  used.    The gateway runs as a set of tasks on a
    simple multiprocessing operating system called LOS.    Both  LOS
    and  the  gateway  code as described here were entirely designed
    and written by Ron Natalie.

       This is an IP gateway with EGP support. The gateway will  run
    on most PDP-11 series processors, but is designed to be portable
    to other machines that have C compilers.  Point-to-point  serial
    links,  DEC  PCL-11/B,  and  the  ACC  LH-DH/11  interfaces  are
    currently supported.  Work is in process to support the Interlan
    Ethernet  interfaces  with  the Address Resolution Protocol, the
    Network Systems Corporations's  HYPERchannel,  and  the  Proteon
    Ringnet hardware.

       All  gateway  functions  and  features  of  the  IP  and ICMP
    protocols are supported with the following exceptions.  The ICMP
    timestamp  packet  is  not  implemented  and  ICMP source quench
    messages are ignored.  IP  timestamp  and  routing  options  are
    supported.    The  Exterior  Gateway  Protocol  is  supported as
    described in RFC904.  Deviations from the specification are made
    to  optimize  the performance as a stub system from the existing
    core networks.  The gateway also uses its own  UDP  based  debug
    and monitoring protocol.  GGP echo packets are also answered.

       In  addition, the gateway provides Virtual-Host service.  TCP
    connections to be dynamically directed to an active host on  the
    BRLNET.    This  allows the host "BRL" to appear to always be up
    for mail purposes.

       The original BRL gateway was an early version  of  the  MIT-C
    gateway  modified  to  know about class B and C addresses and to
    work with the previously mentioned network interfaces.  With the
    advent  of  EGP,  higher  network  traffic,  and greater routing
    intelligence, the modified MIT gateway became ineffective.

       Any  PDP-11  processor  that  has  memory  management.    The
    machines  currently  in  use  are  a PDP-11/34 and LSI-11/23.  A
    console terminal interface and a clock are required, as well  as
    any  network  interfaces.   The built-in line frequency clock on
    the LSI-11 processors may be  used  in  lieu  of  an  additional
    clock.

O/S:

       LOS (the Little Operating System) is a small message-passing,
    multitasking operating system written for the implementation  of
    the  gateway, but is also being planned for use in real-time and
    file server applications.  The Gateway code runs in the hardware
    user mode, while LOS itself runs in kernel mode.  Interrupts are
    serviced in real-time by the user code.

IMPLEMENTATION-LANGUAGE:

       With the exception of small parts of the operating system and
    some  bit manipulation routines, which are written in assembler,
    both LOS and the Gateway code are written in the C language.

    interface unit is intended to run on an  LSI-11  under  the  MOS
    real-time  operating  system.    The  TCP is written in MACRO-11
    assembler language.  The IP is currently  written  in  assembler
    language;  but  being  converted  into  C. There are no plans to
    convert the TCP from assembler into C.

       TCP implements the full specification, although  the  current
    user  interface  lacks a mechanism to communicate URGENT pointer
    information between the TCP and the higher-level software.   The
    code for rubber-EOL has been removed in anticipation of a change
    to the specification.    The  TCP  appears  to  be  functionally
    compatible with all other major implementations.  In particular,
    it is used on a daily basis to  provide  communications  between
    users  on  the  Ft.  Bragg  PRNET  and  ISID on the DDN.  The IP
    implementation is reasonably complete,  providing  fragmentation
    and  reassembly;  routing  to  the first gateway; and a complete
    host-side GGP process.  Currently the source quench  message  is
    ignored.  No  IP  options are generated and all received options
    are ignored.

       A  measurement  collection  mechanism  is   currently   under
    development to collect TCP and IP statistics and deliver them to
    a measurement host for data reduction.

1.7.3. LSI-11/PDP11/LINKABIT
PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:   LINKABIT-DCNET-FUZZBALL

TYPE:   TCP/IP Implementation

DESCRIPTION:

       The DCNET internet software system has  been  developed  with
    DARPA sponsorship over the last three years and used extensively
    for  testing,  evaluation   and   experimentation   with   other
    implementations.    It  currently  runs  in  a sizable number of
    PDP11s and LSI-11s with varying configurations and applications.
    The  system  is designed to be used with the DCNET local network
    and  BOS/VOS  operating  system  for  a   multi-media   internet
    workstation   (so-called   "fuzzball"),   which  operates  using
    emulation  techniques  to  support  ordinary  RT-11  system  and
    application programs.  However, the system has also been used on
    other networks, including the  DDN,  and  with  other  operating
    systems,   including   RSX-11.      An   RSX-11   based  version
    incorporating only IP/TCP modules is presently used  to  support
    the INTELPOST electronic-mail network.

       The  software  system consists of a package of MACRO-11 and C
    modules structured into levels corresponding to  local-net,  IP,
    TCP  and application levels, with user interfaces at each level.
    The local-net  level  supports  several  communication  devices,
    including  synchronous  and  asynchronous  serial  lines, 16-bit
    parallel links and 1822 interfaces.  Hosts using  these  devices
    have  been  connected  to  DDN  IMPs,  Satellite  IMPs, MACRO-11
    Internet Gateways, SRI Port Expanders and  to  the  DCNET  local
    network.    When  used  on  DCNET  the system provides automatic
    routing,  time-synchronization  and  error-reporting  functions.
    The  IP  level  conforms  to the RFC791 specification, including
    fragmentation, reassembly, extended addressing and options,  but
    currently  does  not  interpret  options.    A  full set of ICMP
    features  compatible  with  RFC792   is   available,   including
    destination-unreachable,  timestamp,  redirect and source-quench
    messages.  Destination-unreachable and source-quench information
    is  conveyed  to  the  user  level  via the TCP and raw-datagram
    protocol modules.  Internet gateway  (routing  and  non-routing)
    facilities compatible with RFC823 can be included on an optional
    basis.  This support can be configured to include hierarchically
    structured gateways and subnets.

       The TCP level conforms to the RFC793 specification, including
    PUSH, URGENT and options.  Its structure is  based  on  circular
    buffers for reassembly and retransmission, with repacketizing on
    each retransmission.  Retransmission  timeouts  are  dynamically
    determined  using  measured  roundtrip  delays,  as adjusted for
    backoff.  Data flow into the network is controlled  by  measured
    network  bandwidth,  as  adjusted  by source-quench information.
    Features are included to avoid excessive  segment  fragmentation
                                   17



    and  retransmission into zero windows.  The user interface level
    provides error and URGENT notification, as well as  a  means  to
    set outgoing IP/TCP options.

       A  raw-datagram  interface is available for non-TCP protocols
    such as (RFC768).  It includes internal congestion and  fairness
    controls,   multiple-connection   management  and  timestamping.
    Protocols above UDP supported in the present system include Time
    Server  (IEN-142) and Name Server (IEN-116).  Other raw-datagram
    services include XNET (IEN-158),  GGP  Gateway  (RFC823),  along
    with  developmental  versions  of  an EGP Gateway (RFC827) and a
    DECnet Gateway.  A number of user-level protocol  modules  above
    TCP  have  been  built  and  tested  with  other internet hosts,
    including user/server Telnet (RFC764) user/server FTP  (RFC765),
    user/server  SMTP  (RFC788)  and  various  other  file-transfer,
    debugging and control/monitoring protocols.

       Code  sizes  and  speeds  depend  greatly   on   the   system
    configuration   and  features  selected.    A  typical  30K-word
    LSI-11/2 single-user configuration with  all  features  selected
    and  including  the  operating  system,  device  drivers and all
    buffers  and  control  blocks,  leaves  about  16K   words   for
    user-level application programs and protocol modules.  A typical
    124K-word LSI-11/23 configuration provides the same service to a
    half-dozen  individually  relocated  users.    Disk-to-disk  FTP
    transfers across a DMA interprocessor  link  between  LSI-11/23s
    operate  in  the  range  30-50 Kbps with 576-octet packets.  The
    124K-word PDP11/34 INTELPOST  adaptation  supports  two  56-Kbps
    lines and a number of lower-speed lines.

1.7.5. UNIX 2.9BSD
TYPE:   TCP/IP Implementation

DESCRIPTION:

       2.9BSD TCP/IP is an adaptation  of  Berkeley's  original  VAX
    TCP/IP  (running  under  BSD  4.1B  UNIX)  which  in  turn is an
    offshoot of BBN's VAX TCP/IP.  2.9BSD TCP/IP runs on  PDP-11/44s
    and  PDP-11/70s.    The 2.8 version from SRI was adapted by Bill
    Croft (formerly at SRI), then  Tektronix  adapted  it  for  2.9.
    Berkeley  took  over modification of the software and brought it
    back to SRI where Dan Chernikoff and Greg Satz adapted it for  a
    later  release  of 2.9.  In addition to TCP/IP, UDP, ARP and the
    raw packet  interface  is  available.  ICMP  redirects  are  not
    supported.    User  software  implementations include Telnet and
    FTP, plus Berkeley-developed local  net  protocols,  RWHO,  RSH,
    RLOGIN, and RCP.

       2.9BSD  with  TCP/IP support could probably be made to run on
    smaller PDP-11s although the address space would be  very  tight
    and might present problems.

1.7.6. Venix/11 TCP/IP
PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME: Venix/11 TCP/IP

DESCRIPTION:

       This  is  based  on  the "PDP-11/45" implementation available
    from the MIT Laboratory for  Computer  Science.    It  has  been
    ported  to  a V7 UNIX system, in particular VenturCom's Venix/11
    V2.0.

       As little of the processing as possible takes  place  in  the
    kernel,   to   minimize  the  code  space  required.    It  fits
    comfortably on I&D machines,  but  is  almost  hopeless  on  the
    smaller  machines.   The kernel includes a proNET device driver,
    IP fragment reassembly, IP header processing,  local-net  header
    processing,  and simple routing.  The rest of the IP processing,
    and all of the UDP and TCP functions,  are  in  user  libraries.
    The psuedo-teletype driver is also in the kernel, and is used by
    Server TELNET.

       User programs handle ICMP processing; User and Server TELNET,
    SMTP,  TFTP,  Finger,  and Discard.  There are User programs for
    Nicname and Hostname.   IEN-116  nameservers  are  used  by  all
    programs,  and  an IEN-116 nameserver is also provided.  The TCP
    used is very simple, not very fast, and lies about windows.   No
    FTP is available, nor is one currently planned.

DOCUMENTATION:

       There  is  a  full  set  of  manual pages, and some internals
    documentation.  The kernel code is well commented.

CPU:

       PDP-11/44, 45, 70, 73, 84

1.7.7. PDP-11/45
TYPE:   TCP/IP Implementation

DESCRIPTION:

       In the UNIX kernel we have modules to drive a "Pronet" device
    (10  Mb/s  token-passing  ringnet),  to  transmit  and   receive
    internet  packets,  to demultiplex incoming TCP and UDP packets,
    to reassemble internet fragments, and to  maintain  a  cache  of
    internet  hosts  and their best first hop gateways.  Kernel code
    and data use from 9k to 10.5k bytes depending on the size of the
    receive packets buffer.

       Outside  the  kernel  we  have:  TCP, user and server Telnet,
    SMTP, ICMP, and TFTP.  All are running but are in varying stages

1.7.8. BBN-V6-UNIX
PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:   EDN-V6-UNIX

TYPE:   TCP/IP/ICMP implementation

DESCRIPTION:

       This  TCP/IP/ICMP  implementation  runs  as a user process in
    version 6 UNIX, with modifications obtained from BBN for network
    access.  IP  reassembles  fragments  into  datagrams, but has no
    separate IP user  interface.    TCP  supports  user  and  server
    Telnet,  echo,  discard,  internet  SMTP  mail,  and  FTP.  ICMP
    generates replies to Echo Requests, and sends Source-Quench when
    reassembly buffers are full.

       1. Hardware  -  PDP-11/70 and PDP-11/45 running UNIX version
          6, with BBN IPC additions.

       2. Software - written in C, requiring 25K instruction space,
          20K  data  space.    Supports  10  connections (including
          "listeners").

       3. Unimplemented protocol features:

             - TCP - Discards out-of-order segments.

             - IP - Does not handle some options and ICMP messages.

1.7.9. v 3COM-UNET
PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:   UNET

TYPE:   TCP/IP Implementation

DESCRIPTION:

       UNET is a communication software package which  enables  UNIX
    systems  to  communicate  using  TCP/IP  protocols.    UNET will
    utilize any physical communications media, from low speed  links
    such as twisted pair RS-232C to high speed coaxial links such as
    Ethernet.  All layers of the UNET package are directly available
    to   the  user.    The  highest  layer  provides  user  programs
    implementing  ARPA  standard  File  Transfer  Protocol   (UFTP),
    Virtual  Terminal  Protocol  (UVTP), and Mail Transfer Protocols
    (UMTP).  These programs in  turn  utilize  the  virtual  circuit
    services  of the TCP.  The TCP protocol is implemented on top of
    the IP.  Finally, IP can simultaneously  interface  to  multiple
    local  networks.    UNET  implements  5  of  the 7 layers of the
    International    Standards     Organization     Open     Systems
    Interconnection  Reference  Model,  layers  2  through  6: Link,
    Network, Transport, Session, and Presentation.  Features of  TCP
    6   not   yet   implemented   are   Precedence   and   Security,
    End-of-Letter, and Urgent.  Feature of IP 4 not yet  implemented
    is Options.

1.7.12. BBN-VAX-UNIX
PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:   BBN-VAX-UNIX

TYPE:   TCP/IP Implementation

DESCRIPTION:

       BBN  has  developed  an  implementation  of  TCP/IP for DEC's
    VAX(TM) family of  processors,  that  runs  under  the  Berkeley
    4.1BSD  version  of UNIX(TM).  The development effort was funded
    by DARPA. Some important features of the BBN VAX TCP/IP are that
    it  runs  in  the  UNIX kernel for enhanced performance, it is a
    complete  implementation  of  the  TCP  and  IP  protocols,  and
    provides  facilities  for  direct  user  access  to  the  IP and
    underlying network protocols.  The IP module supports checksums,
    option  interpretation,  fragmentation  and reassembly, extended
    internet address support, gateway communication with  ICMP,  and
    support  of  multi-homing  (multiple interfaces and addresses on
    the same or different networks).  The  TCP  supports  checksums,
    sequencing, the ability to pass options through to the IP level,
    and advanced windowing and adaptive  retransmission  algorithms.
    Support is also provided for the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).

       In  addition  to  the  TCP/IP  software  for the VAX, BBN has
    developed  implementations  of  the  Telnet   Virtual   Terminal
    Protocol, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and Simple Mail Transfer
    Protocol (SMTP), for use with TCP.  These protocols are operated
    as  user  level programs.  Also provided are network programming
    support  tools,  such  as  network   name/address   manipulation
    libraries, status, tracing, and debugging tools.

       The  TCP/IP  and  higher  level  protocol  software  are  now
    available direct from BBN.  The software  is  distributed  on  a
    1600  bpi  tar  format tape, containing the sources and binaries
    for a 4.1BSD UNIX kernel containing  the  network  modifications
    and  the sources and binaries for the higher level protocols and
    support software.  Documentation is provided in the  form  of  a
    set  of  UNIX  manual  pages for the network access device, user
    programs, and libraries.  In addition, a  detailed  installation
    document  is  provided.  Device drivers are supplied for the ACC
    LH-DH/11 IMP interface,  the  Proteon  Associates  PRONET  Local
    Network Interface, the ACC IF-11 IMP interface, and the Interlan
    10MB Ethernet interface.

1.7.15. [VAX-VMS/HYPERLINK]
PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:   Hyperlink/DDN Software

TYPE:    TCP/IP/X.25 Implementation

DESCRIPTION:

       Hyperlink/DDN  is  being  implemented  in accordance with the
    ARPANET Upper Layer Protocols (presentation/application layers),
    Transmission  Control  Protocol  (session/transport layers), and
    Internet Protocol  (network  layer  functions  for  internetwork
    communications).   The software includes the host driver (either
    with Ethernet or Hyperchannel connections), transmission control
    protocol,   internet   protocol,   network   administrator   and
    application  software.    Applications  include  file  transfer,
    electronic mail and Telnet.

       Hyperlink/DDN  integrates ARPANET's packet switching protocol
    standards  with  Internet  Systems   Corporation's   proprietary
    Ethernet-based  hardware  connection  devices  or  with  Network
    Systems  Corporation's  HYPERchannel  connection   devices   for
    complete  connections between LANs and/or long-haul networks.  A
    product option is available which provides an  LSI  11/73  based
    host  front-end  processor  which  will  contain  the TCP and IP
    layers and an X.25  communications  subsystem.    Internet  also

1.7.16. TEKTRONIX-VAX
PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:   VAX/VMS

TYPE:   TCP/IP implementation

DESCRIPTION:

       This implementation  runs  under  VAX  780/VMS.    It  has  a
    hyperchannel  interface  with  a  home-grown VMS driver.  TCP/IP
    from 3COM interoperates with VMS TCP/IP over HYPERchannel.  They
    have  added  TCP and IP options to UNET.  Currently, there is no
    plan to market TCP/IP software, although it is available to  the
    network  research  community for internal use only.  Support has
    been added for Ethernet using an Interlan driver.

       - TCP:   Has no security or precedence.

       - IP:     No datagram reassembly or fragmentation.   Neither
         Internet  control  protocol nor gateway protocol have been
         implemented.     There   are   no   plans   to   implement
         fragmentation.

       - FTP:     Not  compatible  with  Berkeley's  4.2  UNIX  but
         compatible with 3COM's implementation of FTP.   There  are
         plans, however, to make it compatible with 4.2 UNIX.

DESCRIPTION:

       SRI has implemented TCP/IP for the TENEX (FOONEX and  AUGUST)
    operating  system  running  on  DEC-10 KA or KI and F2, F3 or F4
    Foonly processors.  It was adapted from the BBN and ISI versions
    of  TENEX  TCP/IP,  with contributions from Ed Taft of Xerox and
    Phil French of Tymshare, and resides in  the  operating  system.
    It is largely upward-compatible with TOPS-20 implementations and
    fully compatible with AUGMENT.  Telnet, FTP, SMTP,  ICMP,  ECHO,
    TIME,  WHOIS,  and  NAME service are available although some are
    still under development.

       This is an implementation done at BBN.    DARPA  has  dropped

1.7.23. BBN-TOPS-20
PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:   BBN-TOPS-20

TYPE:   TCP/IP Implementation

DESCRIPTION:

       The   TOPS20   Internetworking   software  supports  multiple
    networks, multiple interfaces on a single network, and  multiple
    protocol  suites.   Included in the standard distribution are an
    interface to 1822 nets via an AN20, an interface  to  a  network
    front-end  via  a  DTE20,  and  the DARPA protocol suite (DEC is
    developing an Ethernet interface).

       The DARPA IP, ICMP, TCP, Server TELNET protocols are included
    within  the  TOPS20  monitor; other protocols are implemented as
    user application processes.  The IP module  supports  a  routing
    cache  maintained  via  ICMP redirect NET and HOST messages.  It
    performs fragmentation and reassembly,  implements  all  options
    and  can  forward  traffic between any of the host's interfaces.
    Applications may interface to the IP layer using User Queues.

       All ICMP messages are supported; error messages may  be  sent
    by any of the protocol layers; higher layers are notified when a
    message is received concerning one of their packets.    Messages
    can be sent by applications using the User Queue facility.

       Applications can interface to TCP either as a read/write file
    or via multiple buffers.  The  TCP  layer  supports  IP  routing
    options,   ICMP  destination  unreachable,  source  quench,  and
    redirects which specify a type-of-service, and the segment  size
    option.    Support  for  preemption,  precedence,  and  security
    options is  delegated  to  the  application.    Telnet  supports
    options and subnegotiations.

       There is extensive inter-layer flow control, error reporting,
    and monitoring.  Utilities are available to provide information,
    list monitoring data, and perform diagnostics.

1.11. HEWLETT PACKARD



1.11.1. BBN-HP-3000
PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:   BBN-HP-3000

TYPE:   TCP/IP Implementation

DESCRIPTION:

       HP  3000  series  III  software handles TCP, IP, 1822 and HDH
    protocols.  The code runs under the MPE IV operating system.  It
    is  typically  a  user mode batch job, so that it may be stopped
    and restarted for SYSDUMPs if desired  without  having  to  shut
    down  the rest of the system.  It uses an HP Intelligent Network
    Processor (INP) as the HDCC (Lap B) interface  to  the  network.
    Intrinsics  exist to access TCP or UDP IP.  The protocol process
    includes TCP, IP, 1822 and  a  new  protocol  called  HDH  which
    allows  1822  messages to be sent over HDLC links.  The protocol
    process has about 8k bytes of code and at  least  20k  bytes  of
    data depending on the number of buffers allocated.

       The  TCP  code  is  believed  to  support all features except
    rubber EOL.  The IP code currently supports fragment  reassembly
    but  not fragmentation.  Provisions may be added to allow the IP
    layer to act on routing and source quench  messages.    Security
    and precedence are currently ignored.

       In  addition to TCP, the HP3000 has user and server Telnet as
    well as user FTP.  There is not a server FTP at this time.

       A complete description of the implementation software can  be
    found in IEN-167.

       For  further  information  see BBN Report 4856, January 1982,
    available from BBN.

1.13.5. IBM-VM
PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:   IBM VM

TYPE:   TCP/IP Implementation

DESCRIPTION:

       The VM software is written almost entirely in Pascal, with  a
    small amount of assembler-language support.  Some assembler code
    running on the Series/1 interfaces with the X.25 code, which  is
    a  standard IBM product.  Standard IBM-released software is used
    throughout.

       TCP/IP runs  in  a  separate  disconnected  virtual  machine.
    Similarly, user SMTP, server SMTP, server FTP, and server Telnet
    each occupies a dedicated virtual machine.  User  FTP  and  user
    Telnet   run   within   a  user's  virtual  machine  under  CMS.
    Communication between virtual machines is done through  the  IBM
    Virtual  Machine  Communication  Facility  (VMCF).    A detailed
    preliminary design document is available by  contacting  one  of
    the  individuals listed below.  (Some details have changed since
    it was written, but it is still mostly accurate.)

       A Pronet driver has been implemented to enable the IP/TCP  to
    use  the  PRONET  10  megabit/sec  token ring LAN.  The hardware
    interface is via a DACU (Device Access Control Unit) provided by
    IBM.    The  DACU enables connection of UNIBUS devices to an IBM
    channel.  A driver for Ethernet will also be provided.

       Direct connection to a C/30 IMP will  require  implementation
    of  a  software  driver  in conjunction with a suitable hardware
    interface (e.g., DACU--LH/DH or Series/1--HDH.)

       The University of  Wisconsin  has  implemented  the  Internet
    protocols  (FTP/SMTP/Telnet/TCP/IP)  for  IBM  VM  systems under
    contract with IBM.  In addition, a software interface between IP
    and  an X.25 implementation running on a Series/1 (RPS operating
    system) has been completed.  The complete  package  will  enable
    CSNET IBM VM hosts to connect to the DARPA Internet via TELENET.
    This product is available on the  commercial  market  for  VM/SP
    Release 3, Series/1 EDX Version 4, Series/1 RPS Version 5.2.

CPU:

       Will run on any 370 architecture using VM

1.13.8. IBM-UNIX
PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:   IBM-FED-SYS

TYPE:   front-end interface

DESCRIPTION:

       IBM  Fed  Sys  Division  is  working  on  a  Series 1 FEP for
    interface to the DDN/ARPANET.  That  box  will  be  based  on  a
    Series  1  that was done for USA DARCOM by Channel Systems, Inc.
    as a sub to IBM.  The Channel Systems box was acquired to attach
    to the IBM I/O channel to provide the host an HDH/HDLC interface
    to a remote IMP.

       McKay is expanding the DARCOM box to run IBM  UNIX  and  will
    then migrate an existing UNIX-based TCP/IP to it.  The resulting
    FEP would allow the host to implement FTP, Telnet and  Mail  and
    rely  on  the  Series  1  for  TCP/IP and connection to the net.
    There  are  some  efforts  to  pick  up   the   completed   UCLA
    implementation  and  support  it  as  a  complete  package or as
    host-based FTP, Mail and Telnet for use with the Series 1 FEP.

1.13.10. UCLA-IBM/MVS
PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:   UCLA ACP

TYPE:   TCP/IP Implementation

DESCRIPTION:

       This  is  an  IP/TCP implementation for IBM 370 under OS/MVS.
    Original development and current  enhancements  to  TCP/IP  were
    funded  by  DARPA.    The  complete package is known as "ARPANET
    Control Program" or ACP and was developed from UCLA NCP for  the
    360/91 in 1969.

       1. IMP Interface Hardware:  ACC-IF-IMP/370 interface, or IBM
          Series 1 with Channel Systems  IMP  Interface  Card  (see
          IBM-FED-SYS).

       2. Installation:    Requires  no  system  modifications  for
          installation.  The ACP operates as a user job,  but  must
          be  declared  non-swappable and occupy a high performance
          group to OS/MVS.  Uses ACF/VTAM for virtual terminals and
          IPC.

       3. IP Protocol Implementation:

             - Fragmentation/reassembly:  performs reassembly. Does
               not fragment, assuming  that  higher-level  protocol
               (TCP)  will  create  suitable  size  segments during
               packetizing.

             - Options:  implements  source  routing  (strict   and
               loose).  Other options are accepted but ignored.

             - Identifier     selection:    uses    globally-unique
               identifiers for transmitted segments, independent of
               destination.

             - Reassembly  timeout:  fixed  value  (30-60 seconds),
               independent of  time-to-live  field.    Packets  are
               discarded if time-to-live field is zero.

             - Gateway  functions:    Uses  preset table of "smart"
               gateways,  expects  Redirects  to  correct   choice.
               However,  uses  gateway  from which first packet was
               received (for remotely-initiated association).

             - ICMP: Fully supported (except Time Stamps  and  Info
               Req.)

       4. TCP Protocol Implementation:

             - Precedence, security fields: not set or tested.
                                   79



             - TCP  Options:   May send max packet size option, and
               can receive it.

             - Urgent: may be sent and received by user process.

             - Push: may be sent or received by user process.

             - Retransmission:   successive   retransmissions   use
               exponential  backoff.  Base time is 2 times observed
               exponentially weighted round-trip time.   Round-trip
               time  is  measured as initial packet transmission to
               complete  acknowledgment.  Retransmits  slowly  into
               zero window.

             - Initial Sequence Number: derived from system clock.

             - Window  strategy:  uses conservative strategy, never
               advertising a receive window larger than  the  space
               available in the circular buffer.

             - ACK  generation:  always  sends <ACK> in response to
               receipt of a non-empty  packet.    As  user  process
               removes  bytes  from  buffer,  optimizing  algorithm
               determines when to generate <ACK> to  inform  sender
               of larger window.

       5. UDP:    UDP is implemented.

       6. User-Level  Protocols:   User and Server Telnet, User and
          Server FTP.  Server Telnet access to  TSO  or  any  other
          VTAM  application that handles 3767 line terminals.  STMP
          will be implemented in the future.

       7. Packet  tracing,  Debugging,  and   Monitoring   Features
          Extensive.

1.18. SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION



1.18.1. v SDC
PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:   SDC

TYPE:   TCP/IP implementation

DESCRIPTION:

       SDC's implementation is part of their overall LAN product and
    is designed to run in a variety of configurations,  particularly
    as  a  host  NFE  resident  package  using  an 0586 (8086)-based
    operating system.  IP provides services to the  TCP  module  and
    depends  on  services  of  the  lower  layer protocols.  ICMP is
    implemented as an integral part of this IP.

       The TCP is designed to support a wide range of ULPs and  uses
    a  PAR  mechanism.  Transmission timeout is dynamically adjusted
    to approximate the segment round-trip time  plus  a  factor  for
    internal   processing.      TCP  uses  checksum  and  sequencing
    mechanisms  as  well  as  variable  windowing   for   acceptable
    sequences.  As data is accepted, TCP slides the window upward in
    sequence number space with every segment.  TCP  also  employs  a
    multiplexing  mechanism  for  multiple ULPS within a single host
    and multiple processes in a ULP to use TCP simultaneously.

       The product is  fully  supported  and  documented  from  site
    planning  and  preparation  to post-installation maintenance and
    technical support.

DESCRIPTION:

       The  University  of  Maryland  Computer  Science  Center  has
    implemented  TCP/IP  for  the  SPERRY 1100/60/70/80/90 machines.
    The implementation supports IP, ICMP,  TCP,  SMTP,  and  Telnet.
    The  link  layer  connection is made via the DCNET local-network
    protocol.   The  IP  level  conforms  to  RFC791,  and  supports
    reassembly   and   extended  addressing.    ICMP  functions  are
    implemented  per  RFC792  and  support  destination-unreachable,
    redirects,  echo and timestamps.  The TCP conforms to the RFC793
    except that security, precedence and URGENT have  not  yet  been
    implemented.  An STMP server is also supplied.

TYPE:   TCP/IP/X.25 implementation

DESCRIPTION:

       The   following   DDN   protocols   are   supported  in  this
    implementation: IP,  ICMP,  TCP,  Telnet,  FTP  and  SMTP.    In
    addition,  X.25  and  HDLC  Distant Host are supported.  FTP and
    SMTP are implemented within DDP in the 1100  host.    All  other
    protocols   are   implemented   within  TELCON.    Two  hardware
    configurations are required as a minimum  at  each  Series  1100
    host  location: an 1100/60, 1100/70, 1100/80 or 1100/90 computer
    and a Distributed Communications Processor (DCP/40  or  DCP/10A)
    as  a  front-end.    The  DCP's may also be configured as remote
    concentrators to provide remote terminal access to DDN hosts.  A
    medium  or high-speed loadable line module configured to support
    bit-synchronous communications protocols is required in the  DCP
    to support the HDLC interface.

       Full   interoperability   of   the   X.25   interface   as  a
    heterogeneous DDN host is targeted for July 1985.

1.19.3. [SPERRY/HYPERLINK]
PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:   Hyperlink/DDN Software

TYPE:    DDN-contracted TCP/IP/X.25 Implementation

DESCRIPTION:

       This will be a package  of  software  and  technical  support
    services  for  interfacing  Sperry computing environments to the
    Defense Data Network.

       Hyperlink/DDN is being implemented  in  accordance  with  the
    ARPANET Upper Layer Protocols (presentation/application layers),
    Transmission Control Protocol  (session/transport  layers),  and
    Internet  Protocol  (network  layer  functions  for internetwork
    communications).  The software includes the host driver  (either
    with Ethernet or Hyperchannel connections), transmission control
    protocol,   internet   protocol,   network   administrator   and
    application  software.    Applications  include  file  transfer,
    electronic mail and Telnet.

       Hyperlink/DDN integrates ARPANET's packet switching  protocol
    standards   with   Internet  Systems  Corporation's  proprietary
    Ethernet-based  hardware  connection  devices  or  with  Network
    Systems   Corporation's   HYPERchannel  connection  devices  for
    complete connections between LANs and/or long-haul networks.   A
    product  option  is  available which provides an LSI 11/73 based
    host front-end processor which  will  contain  the  TCP  and  IP
    layers  and  an  X.25  communications  subsystem.  Internet also
    offers high  speed  local-area  network  solutions  for  non-DDN
    requirements which can be integrated with DDN offerings.

1.20.1. SUN-68000
PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:   SUN-Workstation

TYPE:   TCP/IP Implementation

DESCRIPTION:

       The  SUN  workstation  was  originally  designed  by Stanford
    University and is  now  a  commercial  computer  product.    The
    workstation uses the Motorola 68010 virtual memory processor and
    runs 4.2 BSD VMUNIX.  The 4.2 BSD TCP/IP protocols are  used  in
    conjunction  with a 10 mb Ethernet local-area network.  Although
    not  currently  configured,  an  1822  interface  would  not  be
    difficult  to  add.    In  addition  to  the  standard  internet
    protocols, SUN supports the same services as  the  4.2  BSD  VAX
    UNIX  network software: RLOGIN, RSH, RWHO, RUPTIME, DSH, ROUTED,
    REXECD, COURIER.

       SUN is also developing new services and protocols to  enhance
    throughput  and  utility,  such as a net disk/file protocol that
    allows workstations to run UNIX without a local disk.

2. TCP/IP HARDWARE IMPLEMENTATIONS

2.1. ADVANCED COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS



2.1.1. v ACC-ECU
PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:    ECU-II

TYPE:   Error checking unit

DESCRIPTION:

       The  Error Control Unit provides an error-controlled link for
    long distance connection of LH-DH/11 to DDN IMPs.  Data transfer
    between  ECU-II  units  can  take place at 1.5Mb/s when directly
    connected by a 4-pair low capacitance cable  up  to  914  meters
    (3000  feet)  in  length.    Lower  rates  can  be  selected  or
    determined by attached modem types 303, 209, V.35,  or  188-114.
    Units  are  in pairs, one at each end of the communication link.
    The data rate is enhanced by elimination of the need  for  inter
    resource  "handshaking"  on  every  bit  transferred.  The units
    serve as  store-and-forward  buffers,  receiving  and  buffering
    resource-generated  data in semi-conductor RAMs, then forwarding
    it by special protocol  to  the  ECU  near  the  other  resource
    device.    Since  the  ECUs  have  two separate buffers they are
    capable  of  simultaneous  receipt  and  transmission  in   each
    direction.   ECUs are compatible with BBN-1822 or SDLC protocols
    by direct cable or via modems. Compatible with native mode  C/30
    IMPs and TCP/IP.

2.7. MITRE



2.7.1. v MITRE-NAC
PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:    MITRE Network Access Component

TYPE:    LAN or long-haul network interface

DESCRIPTION:

       This is MITRE's second  generation  network  controller  (see
    ZILOG-Z8000).     Using  an  expanded  hardware  base,  industry
    standard backplanes and multiple  microprocessor  boards,  MITRE
    has  built  a  MCS-68000-based  network  access component.  This
    network component has both MULTIBUS and  VERSABUS  form  factors
    and broadband, Ethernet and 1822 network interfaces.

       The   standard   MULTIBUS   network   component  contains  an
    OMNIBYTE-dual-ported 68000, with 128K bytes dynamic RAM, and 96K
    bytes  EPROM,  a  memory  board,  and  a Bridge serial i/o (SIO)
    interface board.  The SIO board has its own 68000 cpu, 8  serial
    ports,  4K  bytes  RAM and 32K bytes ROM.  The long-haul network
    version contains an ACC MULTIBUS-1822 interface.   The  VERSABUS
    version  supports  an ACC VERSABUS-1822 interface.  In addition,
    the VERSABUS version supports an ACC  VERSABUS-UNIBUS  interface
    for host-interfacing to DEC machines.

       The  software  is  written  in 'C' and runs under CMOS, a 'C'
    version of  SRI's  Micro  Operating  System.    In  addition  to
    supporting  TCP,  IP,  ICMP,  and  the appropriate network level
    protocol, the network front-end version (aka  a  host  interface
    unit  for  the  LAN  environment) supports both the DTI-Host-to-
    Front-End Protocol and a MITRE Network Access Protocol.

2.8. QMI



2.8.1. v QMI
PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:    QM10 Advanced Communication Controller

TYPE:    TCP/IP/ICMP Peripheral Chip

DESCRIPTION:

       During  the  construction several TCP implementations for the
    PDP-11 and 16-bit micros (Z8000, M68000) it became evident  that
    two  major  elements  of  the  implementation  process  could be
    improved.  The first is  the  problem  of  integrating  protocol
    software into an operating system.  It was found that as much as
    half of the software relating to a particular implementation was
    not  really  related  to  the protocol implementation but to the
    development  of  facilities  (e.g.    buffer   management)   and
    interfaces  (e.g.  I/O  device  emulators)  between the protocol
    software and a particular system.

       The second problem was that each time  a  new  implementation
    was  built  it  had  to  be  tested  locally, then with external
    implementations, and then watched over in operation for as  much
    as 8 months before a mature, useful system was available.

       It  was felt that if a hardware peripheral could be developed
    which in  a  system  sense  appeared  much  the  same  as  other
    peripherals  yet  implemented  a  "device"  which was the higher
    level protocols the integration  problem  would  be  simplified.
    Further,  if  that  system  could  be constructed in a chip form
    factor, much the  same  as  the  UARTS  of  today,  that  system
    developers  would  reduce  the  problem  of  access  to  mature,
    operational protocol software to that of a  hardware  technician
    rather  than  a sophisticated systems implementor working for as
    much as a year.

       The QM10 is just such a chip,  implementing  as  a  "protocol
    engine"  the  TCP/IP/ICMP  protocols.    Each  chip implements a
    single virtual circuit and is interfaced with a shared memory.

2.10.2. ZILOG Z8000
PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:   Zilog Z8000

TYPE:   network controller

DESCRIPTION:

       This network controller is the product of a series  of  MITRE
    projects   aimed  at  making  network  access  (both  local  and
    long-haul) as straightforward  as  computer  peripheral  access.
    Some  of the new microprocessors make it possible to construct a
    "network controller" that  handles  the  particulars  of  packet
    ordering  and  flow  control  in  the  same  way  that  hardware
    controllers handle the particulars of disk  cylinder  centerline
    or  an  end  of  tap  sensor.    This TCP/IP network controller,
    supported by a Z8000 microprocessor box, is currently interfaced
    to  a number of UNIX systems via a UMC-Z80.  The outboard box is
    accessed by a set of I/O-like  management  calls  (open,  close,
    read,  write,  and  special)  which transport TCP requests via a
    network access protocol.

       The outboard box has 64K bytes of Ram, 32  bytes  of  Rom,  a
    Z8002  micro,  and  a  serial  Usart (880K BPS max.)  All of the
    software was written in C  using  an  in-house  version  of  the
    portable  C  compiler.  The unit interfaces as easily to a local
    network as it does to the DDN.  All that is necessary  for  this
    conversion  is the addition of an ACC-1822 hardware device and a
    new device driver.  Other than different round trip delays, host
    user-level  software  sees no difference between the two network
    devices.  The  resulting  set  of  Z8000-based  building  blocks
    supports  host interface unit and a terminal concentrator on the
    local net.

       Performance with TCP/IP  has  been  measured  with  two  user
    processes  talking via TCP/IP over the cable at 350K BPS.  Rates
    as high as 450K BPS occur when user I/O buffer sizes are set  at
    8K  bytes  per  I/O.   The Internet Protocol contains the lowest
    level of  addressing.    This  allows  for  local  units  to  be
    addressed  in  the  same way remote units, two or three networks
    away, are addressed.  The effect of 300 bit TCP/IP  headers  has
    negligible impact on performance.
