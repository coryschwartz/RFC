characteristics of TELNET implementation.

------------------------------------


Test 0  Open, initial NVT GoAHead and Echo status

          a. Open

            - Can a connection be opened?
            - Action: IUT directed to send an open command.
            - Verification: Check that message "SERVER TELNET"
                received from REF server implementation.

            SUCCESS: Connection opened.
            FAILURE: Connection not opened.

          b. NVT GoAhead status

            - Is the user TELNET waiting for the GoAhead before
                sending data?
            - Action: Send a data string from the IUT to the REF
                peer.
            - Verification: Check that data not received by REF
                peer until the REF has sent a GoAhead.

          SUCCESS: Data sent within 60 seconds of receiving a
             GoAhead.
          FAILURE: Data sent without waiting for GoAhead or
             not sent within 60 seconds of receiving GoAhead-

          c. NVT echo status

            - Is the user not remotely echoing?
            - Action: Send a data string REF to the IUT.
            - Verification: Check that the data string the REF
                has issued is not returned back over the network
                connection to the REF.

          SUCCESS: Data string not received back by REF.
             therefore IUT not remotely echoing.
          FAILURE: Data string received back by REF - IUT
             remotely echoing.

Test 12  NoOperation (NOP) command

          - Can the user TELNET generate a NOP?
          - Action: IUT sends a NOP command.
          - Verification: Check that REF reports that it has
             received the NOP command.

          SUCCESS: NOP command received by REF.
          FAILURE: NOP command not received by REF.

Test 14  Correct generation of ASCII printable character set

          - Can the user TELNET correctly generate the ASCII
              printable character set?
          - Action: The IUT sends a string containing all the
              ASCII printable characters to the REF.
          - Verification: Check that the REF receives the
              character string sent by the IUT with all characters
              correctly transmitted.

          SUCCESS: REF receives a correctly transmitted character
              string of all the ASCII printable characters.
          FAILURE: REF does not correctly receive a character
              string of all ASCII printable characters.

Test 15  Transmission and reception of newline character.

          - Does the IUT correctly send and receive the Carriage
              Return Line-Feed <CR LF> combination?
          - Action: The IUT sends a data string with newline
              characters embedded. The REF sends a data string with
              newline characters embedded to the IUT.
          - Verification: Check that the REF receives the data
              string with the newlines in the correct places. Check
              that the IUT receives the data string with the newlines
              in the correct places.

          SUCCESS: The IUT user TELNET correctly sends the
              <CR LF> combination for newline and correctly
              interprets <CR LF> as newline when it is received.
          FAILURE: The IUT does not correctly send and/or
              interpret the newline character.

Test 16  Transmission and reception of Carriage Return

          - Does the IUT correctly transmit a Carriage Return as
              <CR NULL> and interpret <CR NULL> as Carriage Return
              when it is received?
          - Action: IUT sends a data string with a carriage
              return embedded in it. The REF sends a data string
              with a carriage return embedded in it.
          - Verification: Check that the REF reports that it has
              received a <CR NULL> from the IUT. Check that the IUT
              has received a data string from the REF contains a
              carriage return.

          SUCCESS: The IUT correctly transmits a <CR NULL> for a
              carriage return and can correctly interpret a <CR NULL>
              as a carriage return.
          FAILURE: The IUT does not correctly transmit <CR NULL>
              for carriage return and/or interpret <CR NULL> as
              carriage return.

Test 1  Negotiation and Implementation of Remote Echo option

          - Does the IUT user TELNET correctly respond to
              negotiation requests and denials?
            Does the IUT correctly enable the remote echo option
              it has agreed to enable?
            Does the IUT correctly disable the remote echo option
              when negotiated?

          - Action: REF initiates negotiation sequence and takes
              the IUT through the states of responding to the request
              to do the the option, responding to a request for an
              option when it is already enabled, responding to a
              request to disable the option, responding to a peer's
              announcement that it wishes to do an option, and the
              peer's refusal to do the option.

              If the IUT agrees to enable the remote echo, the REF
              sends a data string to the IUT to determine if the
              string is remotely echoed back. When the option is
              disabled, the REF sends a data string to the IUT to
              determine whether the IUT is still remotely echoing.

          - Verification: Check the option replies reported as
              received by the REF for correctness. If testing
              correct implementation of the remote echo, check if the
              REF has received back the transmitted data string.

          SUCCESS: The IUT correctly responds to the negotiation
              sequences. The IUT correctly enables and disables the
              remote echo. The data string is received by the REF
              when the IUT is in remote echo mode; it is not
              received when the option is disabled.
          FAILURE: The IUT does not correctly respond to the
              negotiation sequences and/or the IUT does not correctly
              enable and disable the Remote Echo option.

Test 2  Negotiation and Implementation of Suppress GoAhead option

          - Does the IUT user TELNET correctly respond to
              negotiation requests and denials?
            Does the IUT correctly enable the GoAhead option it
              has agreed to enable?
            Does the IUT correctly disable the GoAhead option
              when negotiated?

          - Action: REF initiates negotiation sequence and takes
              the IUT through the states of responding to a request
              to do the option, responding to a request for the
              option when it is already enabled, responding to a
              command to disable the option, responding to its peer's
              announcement that is wishes to enable the option, and
              responding to the peer's command to disable the option.

              If the IUT agrees to enable the Suppress GoAhead
              option, the IUT sends a data string to the REF; no
              GoAheads are being generated by the server REF. When
              the option is disabled, the REF is inhibited from
              sending GoAheads and the IUT attempts to send a data
              string to the REF.

          - Verification: Check the IUT option replies reported
              by the REF for correctness. If testing correct
              implementation of the Suppress GoAhead, check if the
              REF has received the transmitted data string although
              no GoAheads are being generated. If the option is
              disabled, check if the IUT waited for the GoAhead to
              send data and if the data string was sent within 60
              seconds of receiving the GoAhead.

          SUCCESS: The IUT correctly responds to the negotiation
              sequences. The IUT correctly enables and disables the
              Suppress GoAhead option.
          FAILURE: The IUT does not correctly respond to the
              negotiation sequences and/or the IUT does not correctly
              enable and disable the Suppress GoAhead option.

Test 3  Negotiation and Implementation of Binary option

          - Does the IUT user TELNET correctly respond to
              negotiation requests and denials?
            Does the IUT correctly enable the Binary option it
              has agreed to enable?
            Does the IUT correctly disable the Binary option when
              negotiated?
          - Action: REF initiates negotiation sequence and takes
              the IUT through the states of responding to a request
              to do the option, responding to a request for the
              option when it is already enabled, responding to a
              command to disable the option, responding to its peer's
              announcement that is wishes to enable the option, and
              responding to the peer's command to disable the option.

              If the IUT agrees to enable the Binary option, the
              IUT sends a data string of non-printable ASCII
              characters , including one TELNET IAC(377), to the REF;
              When the option is disabled, the IUT sends the same
              data string to the IUT. When the IUT has agreed that
              the REF can transmit in binary, a data string
              containing ASCII unprintable characters is sent from
              the REF to the IUT.
          - Verification: Check the IUT option replies reported
              by the REF for correctness. When testing
              implementation of the enabled Binary option, check if
              the REF has reported receiving two IACs from the IUT.
              When the option has been disabled, check the REF to
              determine that two IACs have not been transmitted.
              When the IUT has agreed that the REF may transmit
              Binary, check that the transmitted data string was
              correctly interpreted by the IUT.

          SUCCESS: The IUT correctly responds to the negotiation
              sequences. The IUT correctly enables and disables the
              Binary option.
          FAILURE: The IUT does not correctly respond to the
              negotiation sequences and/or the IUT does not correctly
              enable and disable the Binary option.

Test 4  Negotiation of Timing Mark option

          - Does the IUT user TELNET correctly respond to
              negotiation requests and denials?
          - Action: REF initiates negotiation sequence and takes
              the IUT through the states of responding to a request
              to do the option, responding to a request for the
              option when it is already enabled, responding to a
              command to disable the option, responding to its peer's
              announcement that is wishes to enable the option, and
              responding to the peer's command to disable the option.
          - Verification: Check the IUT option replies reported
              by the REF for correctness.
              
          SUCCESS: The IUT correctly responds to the negotiation
              sequences.
          FAILURE: The IUT does not correctly respond to the
              negotiation sequences.
              
Test 5  Negotiation of Extend Option List option
              
          - Does the IUT user TELNET correctly respond to
              negotiation requests and denials?
          - Action: REF initiates negotiation sequence and takes
              the IUT through the states of responding to a request
              to do the option, responding to a request for the
              option when it is already enabled, responding to a
              command to disable the option, responding to its peer's
              announcement that is wishes to enable the option, and
              responding to the peer's command to disable the option.
          - Verification: Check the IUT option replies reported
              by the REF for correctness.

          SUCCESS: The IUT correctly responds to the negotiation
              sequences.
          FAILURE: The IUT does not correctly respond to the
              negotiation sequences.

Test 6  Negotiation and Implementation of Status option

          - Does the IUT user TELNET correctly respond to
              negotiation requests and denials?
              Does the IUT correctly enable the Status option it
              has agreed to enable?
              Does the IUT correctly disable the Status option when
              negotiated?

          - Action: REF initiates negotiation sequence and takes
              the IUT through the states of responding to a request
              to do the option, responding to a request for the
              option when it is already enabled, responding to a
              command to disable the option, responding to its peer's
              announcement that is wishes to enable the option, and
              responding to the peer's command to disable the option.

              If the IUT agrees to enable the Status option, the
              REF sends the subnegotiation command Status Send to the
              IUT.

          - Verification: Check the IUT option replies reported
              by the REF for correctness. When testing
              implementation of the enabled Status option, check if
              the REF has reported receiving a Status is
              subnegotiation reply from the IUT correctly listing the
              status of the negotiated options.
              SUCCESS: The IUT correctly responds to the negotiation
              sequences. The IUT correctly enables the Status
              option.

          FAILURE: The IUT does not correctly respond to the
              negotiation sequences and/or the IUT does not correctly
              enable the Status option.
Test 18  Non transmission of request for a refused option until
a new connection has been made or the status of another option changed.

          - Does the IUT user TELNET correctly not send a request
              for a previously refused option?
          - Action: REF is placed in a state where it refuses
              all options. The IUT requests the REF to Do Binary and
              is refused. The IUT is directed to again request the
              option.
          - Verification: Check to see if the REF reports
              having received the second option request.

          SUCCESS: The IUT correctly did not send the second
              option request to the REF.
          FAILURE: The IUT sends the second option request to
              the REF.

Test 20  Subnegotiation command not sent for an unnegotiated option

          - Does the IUT user TELNET correctly not send a
              subnegotiation request for an unnegotiated option?
          - Action: Status option is not enabled. IUT is
              directed to send the subnegotiation command Status Send
              to the REF.

          SUCCESS: The IUT user TELNET correctly sends the
              <CR LF> combination for newline.
          FAILURE: The IUT does not correctly send newline
              character.

Test 13  Transmission and reception of Carriage Return

          - Does the IUT correctly transmit a Carriage Return as
              <CR NULL> and interpret <CR NULL> as Carriage Return
              when it is received?
          - Action: IUT sends a data string with a carriage
              return embedded in it. The REF sends a data string
              with a carriage return embedded in it.
          - Verification: Check that the REF has received a data
              string from the IUT containing a <CR> (an octal 15).
              Check that the IUT has received a data string from the
              REF containing a carriage return.

          SUCCESS: The IUT correctly transmits a <CR NULL> for a
              carriage return and can correctly interpret a <CR NULL>
              as a carriage return.
          FAILURE: The IUT does not correctly transmit <CR NULL>
              for carriage return and/or interpret <CR NULL> as
              carriage return.

              had no effect on the data string.

          SUCCESS: Unaccompanied DM command correctly handled by IUT.n
          FAILURE: Unaccompanied DM command not correctly handled
              by the IUT.

Test 1  Negotiation and Implementation of Remote Echo option

          - Does the IUT server TELNET correctly respond to
              negotiation requests and denials?
            Does the IUT correctly enable the remote echo option
              it has agreed to enable?
            Does the IUT correctly disable the remote echo option
              when negotiated?

          - Action: REF initiates negotiation sequence and takes
              the IUT through the states of responding to the request
              to do the the option, responding to a request for an
              option when it is already enabled, responding to a
              request to disable the option, responding to a peer's
              announcement that it wishes to do an option, and the
              peer's refusal to do the option.

              If the IUT agrees to enable the remote echo, the REF
              sends a data string to the IUT to determine if the
              string is remotely echoed back. When the option is
              disabled, the REF sends a data string to the IUT to
              determine whether the IUT is still remotely echoing.

          - Verification: Check the option replies reported as
              received by the REF for correctness. If testing
              correct implementation of the remote echo, check if the
              REF has received back the transmitted data string.

          SUCCESS: The IUT correctly responds to the negotiation
              sequences. The IUT correctly enables and disables the
              remote echo. The data string is received by the REF
              when the IUT is in remote echo mode; it is not
              received when the option is disabled.
          FAILURE: The IUT does not correctly respond to the
              negotiation sequences and/or the IUT does not correctly
              enable and disable the Remote Echo option.
              
Test 2 Negotiation and Implementation of Suppress GoAhead option
              
          - Does the IUT server TELNET correctly respond to
              negotiation requests and denials?
            Does the IUT correctly enable the GoAhead option it
              has agreed to enable?
            Does the IUT correctly disable the GoAhead option
              when negotiated?
              
          - Action: REF initiates negotiation sequence and takes
              the IUT through the states of responding to a request
              to do the option, responding to a request for the
              option when it is already enabled, responding to a
              command to disable the option, responding to its peer's
              announcement that is wishes to enable the option, and
              responding to the peer's command to disable the option.
              If the IUT agrees to enable the Suppress GoAhead
              option, the IUT sends a data string to the REF; no
              GoAheads are being generated by the server REF. When
              the option is disabled, the REF is inhibited from
              sending GoAheads and the IUT attempts to send a data
              string to the REF.
              
          - Verification: Check the IUT option replies reported
              by the REF for correctness. If testing correct
              implementation of the Suppress GoAhead, check if the
              REF has received the transmitted data string although
              no GoAheads are being generated. If the option is
              disabled, check if the IUT waited for the GoAhead to
              send data and if the data string was sent within 60
              seconds of receiving the GoAhead.

          SUCCESS: The IUT correctly responds to the negotiation
              sequences. The IUT correctly enables and disables the
              Suppress GoAhead option.
          FAILURE: The IUT does not correctly respond to the
              negotiation sequences and/or the IUT does not correctly
              enable and disable the Suppress GoAhead option.

Test 3  Negotiation and Implementation of Binary option

          - Does the IUT server TELNET correctly respond to
              negotiation requests and denials?
            Does the IUT correctly enable the Binary option it
              has agreed to enable?
            Does the IUT correctly disable the Binary option when
              negotiated?

          - Action: REF initiates negotiation sequence and takes
              the IUT through the states of responding to a request
              to do the option, responding to a request for the
              option when it is already enabled, responding to a
              command to disable the option, responding to its peer's
              announcement that is wishes to enable the option, and
              responding to the peer's command to disable the option.

              If the IUT agrees to enable the Binary option, the
              IUT sends a data string of non-printable ASCII
              characters , including one TELNET IAC(377), to the REF;
              When the option is disabled, the IUT sends the same
              data string to the IUT. When the IUT has agreed that
              the REF can transmit in binary, a data string
              containing ASCII unprintable characters is sent from
              the REF to the IUT.

          - Verification: Check the IUT option replies reported
              by the REF for correctness. When testing
              implementation of the enabled Binary option, check if
              the REF has reported receiving two IACs from the IUT.
              When the option has been disabled, check the REF to
              determine that two IACs have not been transmitted.
              When the IUT has agreed that the REF may transmit
              Binary, check that the transmitted data string was
              correctly interpreted by the IUT.

          SUCCESS: The IUT correctly responds to the negotiation
              sequences. The IUT correctly enables and disables the
              Binary option.
          FAILURE: The IUT does not correctly respond to the
              negotiation sequences and/or the IUT does not correctly
              enable and disable the Binary option.

Test 4  Negotiation of Timing Mark option

          - Does the IUT server TELNET correctly respond to
              negotiation requests and denials?
          - Action: REF initiates negotiation sequence and takes
              the IUT through the states of responding to a request
              to do the option, responding to a request for the
              option when it is already enabled, responding to a
              command to disable the option, responding to its peer's
              announcement that is wishes to enable the option, and
              responding to the peer's command to disable the option.
          - Verification: Check the IUT option replies reported
              by the REF for correctness.

          SUCCESS: The IUT correctly responds to the negotiation
              sequences.
          FAILURE: The IUT does not correctly respond to the
              negotiation sequences.

Test 5  Negotiation of Extend Option List option

          - Does the IUT server TELNET correctly respond to
              negotiation requests and denials?

          - Action: REF initiates negotiation sequence and takes
              the IUT through the states of responding to a request
              to do the option, responding to a request for the
              option when it is already enabled, responding to a
              command to disable the option, responding to its peer's
              announcement that is wishes to enable the option, and
              responding to the peer's command to disable the option.

          - Verification: Check the IUT option replies reported
              by the REF for correctness.

          SUCCESS: The IUT correctly responds to the negotiation
              sequences.
          FAILURE: The IUT does not correctly respond to the
              negotiation sequences.

Test 6  Negotiation and Implementation of Status option

          - Does the IUT server TELNET correctly respond to
              negotiation requests and denials?
            Does the IUT correctly enable the Status option it
              has agreed to enable?
            Does the IUT correctly disable the Status option when
              negotiated?
          - Action: REF initiates negotiation sequence and takes
              the IUT through the states of responding to a request
              to do the option, responding to a request for the
              option when it is already enabled, responding to a
              command to disable the option, responding to its peer's
              announcement that is wishes to enable the option, and
              responding to the peer's command to disable the option.

              If the IUT agrees to enable the Status option, the
              REF sends the subnegotiation command Status Send to the IUT.

          - Verification: Check the IUT option replies reported
              by the REF for correctness. When testing
              implementation of the enabled STATUS, check if the REF
              has reported receiving a Status is subnegotiation reply
              from the IUT correctly listing the status of the
              negotiated options.

          SUCCESS: The IUT correctly responds to the negotiation
              sequences. The IUT correctly enables the Status
              option.

         TELNET SCENARIOS AND TESTS DESCRIPTIONS

Scenario File SERVER_OPTIONS2 Tests optional TELNET command:
Abort Output.

------------------------------------


Test 11  Abort Output (AO) command

          - Does the server TELNET respond correctly to AO?
          - Action: REF sends an AO command.
          - Verification: Check that REF reports that it has
              received a Synch. Then the IUT is directed to send a
              data string and the REF checked to see if the data
              string is received. It should not be received.

          SUCCESS: The IUT responds to an AO by sending the REF a
              Synch and not sending any further output data across
              the TELNET connection.
          FAILURE: The IUT either does not respond to an AO with
              a Synch and/or continues to send output data to the
              peer protocol.

            TELNET SCENARIOS AND TESTS DESCRIPTIONS

Scenario File SERVER_SYNCH Tests optional TELNET command: Synch.

------------------------------------

Test 7  Synch command (TCP urgent with Data Mark (DM) embedded in
data stream).

          - Does the server TELNET correctly respond to a Synch?
          - Action: REF sends a series of Synch commands
              embedded in a very long data string.
          - Verification: Check the data string returned to the
              Central Driver by the IUT to determine if any data
              immediately preceding a Synch has been lost. The loss
              of this data indicates that the IUT has responded
              correctly to the Synch. However, if no data is lost
              the IUT may also have handled the Synch correctly.
          
          SUCCESS: Data immediately preceding a Synch was lost or
              no data was lost indicates successful handling of the
              Synch by the IUT.
