Test 4093 timestamp option pointer bumped by 4

     - Can the IUT detect an option that isn't well-formed?

     - Action:  Send a datagram to the IP Implementation Under Test
     containing a Remote Driver command request for the IUT to send
     a datagram with a 12-byte option field. This datagram should
     be passed by the IUT to its Remote Driver. The IUT's Remote
     Driver should request the IUT to send the reply datagram
     required by the IP Remote Driver Specification to the IP
     Tester. This contains an invalid address and timestamp
     timestamp option whose option pointer is four more than it
     should be. The IUT is required to inform its Remote Driver
     that the request is invalid. The Remote Driver should then
     request the IUT to send an IP Remote Driver Specification
     error message to the IP Tester.

     - Verification: The IP Tester will display the error message
     datagram that must contain "ident = 4093 error" in its 18-
     byte data field. The IP Tester should also display "HL5"

     Driver should request the IUT to send the reply datagram
     required by the IP Remote Driver Specification to the IP
     Tester. This contains an invalid prespecified timestamp option
     whose option pointer is four less than it should be. The IUT
     is required to inform its Remote Driver that the request is
     invalid. The Remote Driver should then request the IUT to send
     an IP Remote Driver Specification error message to the IP
     Tester.
