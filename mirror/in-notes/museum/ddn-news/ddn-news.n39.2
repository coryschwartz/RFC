                           MILNET/MINET INTEGRATION

       Integration   of   the   USEUCOM  MINET  communication  subsystem
       (including  all  backbone  and  access  lines)   into   the   DDN
       unclassified  segment (MILNET) was completed on 18 December 1984.
       The ongoing MINET stage II (western Med.)  installation  will  be
       completed under current contract arrangements.  Further expansion
       of communications support to the MINET user community,  including
       engineering  and  installation  of stage III (eastern Med.), will
       evolve through follow-on expansion of the MILNET.  This expansion
       will  include  increased inter- and intra-theater connectivity as
       part of the DDN program.  (James Powell, B613, 703-285-5101,  (V)
       356-5101.)



                        DDN NODE INSTALLATION SCHEDULE

       The  DDN  PMO  has  completed  an initial draft Node Installation
       Schedule which encompasses 120 new DDN MILNET, DISNET, and DODIIS
       installations  between  February 1985 and April 1986.  A majority
       of sites  have  completed  their  nomination/presurvey  and  site
       survey   processes,   and  many  are  ready  to  begin  equipment
       installation.   Detailed  schedules  which  were  coordinated  in
       February  with  Service  representatives  and  the  DDN principal
       contractor, BBNCC, have  been  published  and  forwarded  to  the
       Services and DCA Action Offices for implementation.

       Two major changes to installation approach have been directed:

          1. Node  equipment  (i.e.,  processor,  modem  and crypto
             cabinets) will be installed and integrated  into  site
             facilities    in    accordance    with   site   survey
             documentation  independent  of  the  availability   of
             interswitch  trunk  (IST) lines.  In those cases where
             IST availability does not support  activation  at  the
             time  installation  is  complete,  DCA  will  have the
             contractor revisit the site when the ISTs  are  turned
             on  for  use  not  only to complete integration of the
             node  into  the  network,  but  to  execute  line  and
             equipment performance testing and acceptance.

          2. DCA  will  fund  and/or  perform  site engineering and
             installation tasks in support of the installation plan
             and  schedule  when  the  Service  E&I  agency  cannot
             support the required schedule.  This approach is taken
             temporarily  to  expedite  completion  of  the crucial
             expansion effort through April 1986 and to permit  the
             services  to successfully complete programming actions
             to support site E&I work beginning April 1986.

                                DODIIS NETWORK

       The Department of Defense Intelligence Agency Information  System
       (DIA/DODIIS) community will have a secure data network consisting
       of C/30 IMPs and a C/70 Monitoring  Center  at  approximately  40
       sites  around  the  world  within  the  next  four  years.    The
       subnetwork, provided by the DDN PMO, will be integrated into  the
       DDN  Integrated  Secure  Network  (DISNET)  when  blacker devices
       become available.  Service O&M commands have  been  requested  to
       confirm  site  selection/nominations  made  by  DIA  for the 1985
       DODIIS expansion.  DODIIS also has a test facility consisting  of
       2 C/30s, a C/70 MC, and supporting TEMPEST terminals and printers
       located in the DIAC  at  Bolling  AFB.    The  initial  phase  of
       installation,  including  sites  and  trunks,  is  underway.  The
       completion of the DODIIS AFIS site has  been  delayed  due  to  a
       facility rehabilitation project.  Other DODIIS site installations
       are being  delayed  due  to  problems  with  ATTIS  and  BOCs  in
       providing  interswitch  trunks.  Current information indicates an
       IOC in the May/June 1985 time period.  (Mr. Charles  F.  Russell,
       703-285-5102, (V) 356-5102.)



                     HOST INTERFACE QUALIFICATION ACTIVITY

       The  Test  and  Evaluation  Branch,  B617,  recently  tested  the
       Advanced Computer Communications  (ACC)  IF-11/X.25  version  3.7
       interface  and it was granted a fully qualified status to operate
       on the DDN.  Several other interfaces are currently being  tested
       and  are close to passing the qualification test. (Mr. Chuck Ely,
       B617, 703-285-5337, (V) 356-5337)



          DRAFT DCA CIRCULAR FOR X.25/1822 HDH QUALIFICATION TESTING

       A  draft  DCAC  370-P195-XX  entitled   "Defense   Data   Network
       Qualification Testing-Link and Network Layers" is complete and in
       the  process  of  being  edited.    This  circular  provides  the
       administrative  actions  and  test procedures necessary to insure
       that candidate hosts for the  Defense  Data  Network  (DDN)  will
       properly interface with the network.  Both access protocols--X.25
       and 1822 HDH--required for qualification are covered.  (Mr. Chuck
       Ely, B617, 703-285-5337, (V) 356-5337.)



                        DDN HOST INTERFACE ACQUISITION

       To  increase  the  commercial  availability of DDN interfaces for
       major computer systems, the DDN PMO has now  awarded  to  various
       vendors  a  total  of  seven  contracts.    The  two  most recent
       contracts were awarded to Honeywell Information Systems  for  the
       DPS  8  GCOS  8 family, and to IBM Corporation for the IBM 370 VM
       family.  An eighth contract is currently in progress.

       Contracts awarded to-date are listed below:
                 Company                          Host Family

          Control Data Corporation          CDC Cyber 170 - NOS
          Gould Software Division           DEC VAX - VMS
          Honeywell Information Systems     HIS DPS 8 - GCOS 8
          Honeywell Information Systems     HIS Level 6 - GCOS 6 MOD 400
          Network Solutions                 IBM 370 - MVS
          IBM Corporation                   IBM 370 - VM
          Internet Systems                  Sperry 1100 - OS/1100

       These contracts require  that  the  interface  be  installed  and
       tested  in  a  government-designated  test  site.   The U.S. Army
       Information  Systems  Software  Support  Command,  Falls  Church,
       Virginia, has been designated as the test site for the IBM 370 VM
       interface.  Selection of other test sites is in progress.



                        PERSONAL COMPUTER (PC) SUPPORT

       The DDN PMO has launched several initiatives to improve  personal
       computer  access  to  the  MILNET,  recognizing  that  the use of
       personal computers is one of the  Military  Department's  fastest
       growing needs in computer processing.

       To  provide a more suitable PC interface for the short term, some
       minor enhancements are planned for the C/30 TAC.  While the  C/30
       TAC  is  superb  at  providing  an  interface  with  a human at a
       keyboard, it was never intended to handle the steady data  stream
       generated  by a personal computer uploading a file, or to provide
       many of the applications being requested by the growing  tide  of
       personal computer users.

       Enhancements  currently  being  worked on include changes in flow
       control handling and provision for direct communication  from  PC
       to PC.  For instance, the effective data throughput of a C/30 TAC
       for a  pc-to-host  connection  is  between  300  and  1200  baud,
       depending  on  the  make of the PC and the software in use on it.
       In particular, flow control handling problems are caused  when  a
       TAC  transmits an XOFF signal to the PC to stop the flow of data.
       Currently, this  occurs  when  the  input  buffer  is  within  12
       characters  from  overflow.   This is more than adequate when the
       TAC is interfacing with a human being, as it was designed to  do.
       However,  many PCs simply do not react to the XOFF quickly enough
       to avoid overflowing the 12 character spaces left  in  the  TAC's
       input  buffer.    A  corrective  action  under  consideration  to
       compensate for this  problem  includes  raising  the  TAC's  XOFF
       trigger  point from 12 characters to a greater value, thus giving
       the PC more time to react.

       For the long term, a different approach is  required.    Although
       some  limited gains such as described above are possible with the
       C/30,  any  other  substantial  changes   would   require   major
       modifications  to  TAC hardware or software or both.  This is not
       desirable for a variety of reasons.   A  number  of  options  are
       under study, and a decision is expected later this year regarding
       the optimum approach.   (Maj.  Glynn  Parker,  703-285-5133,  (V)
       356-5133.)



                           MILNET TAC ACCESS CONTROL

       The  MILNET  TAC  Access  Control  System  (TACACS), Phase 1, was
       extended into Europe in January 1985.  Initially, the system  was
       implemented   with   a  universal  password  for  familiarization
       purposes as was done with MILNET TACACS, in the CONUS and Pacific
       areas,  and  the  system  became  fully  operational using unique
       individual IDs and Access Codes on 6 February 1985.

       ARPANET introduced a  separate  login  system  in  January  1985.
       ARPANET TAC login uses conventional passwords which are validated
       by login hosts  whereas  MILNET  TACACS  validation  of  IDs  and
       passwords  is  handled  in  the  IMP  or node.  Phase 2 of MILNET
       TACACS involves a plan to use login hosts, pending  a  period  of
       observation  and careful evaluation of the ARPANET system.  (Maj.
       Glynn Parker, 703-285-5133, (V) 356-5133.)



                 DEADBOLT--AN ENCRYPTION/AUTHENTICATION DEVICE

       A prototype device, known as DEADBOLT, is being  constructed  for
       NSA  by  the MITRE Corporation.  DCA is participating with NSA in
       the development of this Low-cost Encryption/Authentication Device
       (LEAD)   for   terminal-to-host   communication  in  unclassified
       applications.  This prototype will be used in an operational test
       to be conducted in late spring. (Maj. Glynn Parker, 703-285-5133,
       (V) 356-5133.)



                   USER REQUIREMENTS DATABASE (URDB) STATUS

       As of 31 January 1985, the User  Requirements  Data  Base  has  a
       total of 4561 Hosts and 16641 Terminals registered.  Navy and Air
       Force have started validation efforts in order to clean up  their
       portion  of  the  database.    On-site  training was conducted at
       COMNAVTELCOM in Washington, and Gunther AFB, Alabama.

       Efforts have also begun  in  the  redesign  of  the  database  in
       preparation  for conversion to ADABAS.  This work is scheduled to
       begin  during  the  next  quarter.    (Ms.  Sandy   Vest,   B616,
       703-285-5456, (V) 356-5456.)



                  TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE REQUESTS (TSRS)

       The  DDN  PMO  Telecommunications  Management  Section  has  been
       reorganized, according to Mr. John Claitor,  Chief  of  the  Data
       Base   and   Configuration  Management  Branch.    This  section,
       presently under  control  by  this  branch,  is  responsible  for
       processing all requirements attached to the Feeder TSR forms--the
       forms to request DDN service.  Headed by Mr. Ron Gutschmidt,  the
       section   encompasses   three  data  entry  personnel,  two  port
       allocators, four technical administrative personnel and one  work
       administrator.    An  additional  three  technical administrative
       personnel and one port allocator are being recruited in order  to
       satisfy   user  and  backbone  requirements  in  an  orderly  and
       effective manner.

       The requirements processed within  the  DDN  PMO  have  increased
       considerably over the past two years.  In FY 1983, a total of 521
       DDN TSRs were processed, and in  FY  1984,  1290  DDN  TSRs  were
       issued.    So  far  in FY 1985, a total of 800 DDN TSRs (Oct-Jan)
       were processed, with  an  estimation  of  3000  DDN  TSRs  to  be
       processed  during  the  FY  1985  year.   Presently, this section
       processes approximately 40 DDN  TSRs  to  the  field  each  week,
       including  user requirements, backbone trunks and dial-up service
       lines to the TAC.

       The  processing  of  DDN  TSRs  is  being  accomplished  using  a
       semi-automated  process  by  a direct connection to the DCA/DCAOC
       computer.  Feeder TSRs  are  received,  transformed  into  a  DDN
       formatted  TSR  and  turned  over to the technical administrative
       personnel.  Information is then added by the port allocators  and
       technical   administrative   personnel,   reviewed  by  the  work
       administrator,  and  finally  transmitted  by  the   data   entry
       personnel.

       However,  the  process  is still being hindered because some TCOs
       have not addressed the Feeder TSRs to the  correct  RI  (RUEJDDN)
       and PLA (DDN PMO TSR-CRP TRAFFIC WASHINGTON D.C.).



                           DDN COST ALLOCATION MODEL

       The September 1984 Defense Data Network Cost Allocation Model was
       distributed  on  10  January  1985.    Publication  of  the  Cost
       Allocation  Model  came  in response to requests from prospective
       DDN users that a method be provided by  which  various  proposals
       for  utilization  of the DDN may be compared and evaluated during
       the ADP acquisition process.  Limited distribution  was  made  to
       cognizant  DoD  agencies  and  MILDEP activities and each MILDEP,
       DCS, or O&M command  was  provided  with  150  copies  for  their
       distribution.

       Entry  of this publication into the Defense Technical Information
       Center (DTIC) is also planned.   In  the  interim,  requests  for
       copies  should  be addressed to the parent agency or MILDEP, DCS,
       or  O&M  commands.  (James  Powell,   B613,   703-285-5101,   (V)
       356-5101.)



                             DDN LOGISTIC SUPPORT

       The  1 December 1984 DDN Newsletter reported that the DDN PMO had
       tasked Dynamics Research Corporation to do a comparative logistic
       support  concept  analysis  for  DDN.    The  final report of the
       analysis has been delivered and  is  being  integrated  into  the
       Logistic Support Concept for DDN.

       A  Management  Team (ILSMT), hosted by the Deputy Program Manager
       for Logistics (DPML), was held at 7915  Westpark  Drive,  McLean,
       Virginia  on  12  and  13  March  1985.    (James A. Evans, B635,
       703-285-5443, (V) 356-5443.)



       NETWORK ACCESS COMPONENT (NAC) UNITS FOR THE DEFENSE DATA NETWORK

       A firm-fixed-price contract, DCA200-85-C-0007, was awarded on  12
       February  1985 to Aydin Monitor Systems, 502 Office Center Drive,
       Fort Washington, Pa 19034, in the amount  of  $3,890,732.    This
       contract is for the development of NAC units.  These units are to
       be configured as Mini-terminal  Access  Controllers  (MINI-TACs),
       Host   Front   End   Processors  (HFEPs)  or  Terminal  Emulation
       Processors  (TEPs).    The  contract   also   includes   optional
       production  in the amount of $14,109,268.  The schedule calls for
       the development  to  be  completed  by  September  of  1985  with
       production   units   to   be  available  7  months  later.    RFP
       DCA200-84-R-0027 was released on 27 June 1984 to 93  contractors,
       and  four  responses  were  received.   The contracting office is
       DECCO D560 and the contracting officer is  Major  George  Tucker,
       Code   D560,  phone  618-256-5196.    The  contracting  officers'
       technical   representative   is   Ronald   Hyrkas,   Code   B626,
       703-285-5105.  (James Powell, B613, 703-285-5101, (V) 356-5101.)



                             REQUEST FOR DOCUMENTS

       Private  companies  have  made numerous calls and requests to the
       DDN PMO for copies of  documents  while  preparing  responses  to
       requests  for  proposals  (RFPs).    To obtain copies of most DDN

       The DDN Newsletter provides information of  general  interest  to
       users.    Both  official and unofficial articles are published in
       the DDN Newsletter.  Articles in  the  official  section  contain
       policy  announcements  and  general  information disseminated for
       review, adherence,  and  possible  response.    Articles  in  the
       unofficial  section contain items of general information which do
       not necessarily represent official policy or practice.  As  space
       permits, this section may include items submitted by users.  Such
       items should be as brief as possible, and should be forwarded  to
       NEWS@SRI-NIC.ARPA  or  DCACODEB613@DDN1.ARPA  for  consideration.
       All articles for the unofficial  section  should  be  signed  and
       should provide the organizational affiliation of the contributor.
