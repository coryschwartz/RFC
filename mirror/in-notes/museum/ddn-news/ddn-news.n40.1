			MILNET TAC MANAGEMENT

DDN Management Bulletin 26, 30 Jan 85 and DCA AUTODIN message 211531Z
Nov 84 (with amendments) advised that the Defense Data Network Program
Management Office (DDN PMO) would be establishing configuration
management for the DDN Terminal Access Controllers (TACs) for a number
of reasons: to provide centralized TAC port allocation, to validate
those connections to TAC ports that were authorized and operational,
and to identify those connections requiring transfer of billing from the
current organization to DDN.  Supporting commands of the TACs were
requested to submit Request for Service (RFS)/Feeder Telecommunications
Service Request (TSR) to justify and validate the current port
connections.  This was to be accomplished by 1 May 85.  The DDN PMO
also advised that any connections not validated would be disabled
effective 15 May 85.  (Quite frankly, the response to validate the
connections has been less than favorable.)

Effective 1 Aug 85, all TAC port connections that have not been
validated by an RFS/Feeder TSR will be disabled.  10 TACs per week
will be selected for this action, until all the TACs have been
covered.

The DDN PMO will accept requests to stay a port disablement for 60
days to allow for submission of the appropriate RFS/Feeder TSR.  Ten
days after port disablement, formal action will be taken by the DDN
PMO to disconnect the circuit and remove any equipment from the node
site, as appropriate, providing no arrangements with the DDN PMO have
been made to the contrary.

To verify if a port connection has been validated, call John Saunders,
(703) 734-1360 (AV) 356-5527/8.  Effective 1 Aug 85, problems
associated with the TAC connection should be referred to the MILNET
Mgr, Lt Fennig, DCA/B646, (703) 285-5230 (AV) 356-5230.
