      hardware assistance, for problems with host interfaces, or suspected node

      especially those that will affect the IMP.

      The NOC is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Call the numbers

========================================================================       
       Contacts at the NETWORK INFORMATION CENTER (NIC) at SRI 
========================================================================

   SRI International (SRI), under contract to the DDN-PMO, provides general 
   network information and assistance to new network users and manages the 
   ARPANET/MILNET Network Information Center (NIC).   The NIC works closely 
   with the DCA DDN-PMO, the NOC, the Network Technical Liaison, the Network 
   Host Administrators, network protocol groups, vendors, and military agencies
   to help direct new users to the right contact or source of information.  The
   NIC maintains data bases and information servers of general interest to 
   network users, and publishes and/or distributes publications on behalf of 
   DCA.  The NIC also maintains the WHOIS registry of network users, the 
   official DoD Host Name Table, and the DoD Protocol Repository.

   In general, contact the NIC if you are unsure of where to obtain 
   information.  The NIC reference staff will attempt to direct you to the 
   proper contact or source of information.

   For specific questions about programs or policies at a given host, contact 
   the Network Technical Liaison or Host Administrator for that host.  A list 
   of these people can be obtained online from the SRI-NIC (10.0.0.73) machine 
   as <NETINFO>Liaison.txt and <NETINFO>Host-Administrators.txt via FTP from 
   your local host.

   NETWORK INFORMATION CENTER (NIC)    (415) 859-3695    NIC@SRI-NIC

      This is the general 'hotline' for network information.  Phone service is 
      available from 8 am until 5 pm PST.  In cases where it is available, 
      electronic mail is the preferred method of contact, since this provides a
      record of the question or information being supplied.

      request will be distributed to the staff member best able to handle the
