Dear Net Users

As of Wednesday, June 24, 1981, the Network Information Center (NIC) will leave
the SRI-KL machine and move to a new location on the SRI-NIC machine (0/73 
dec).  After this date the <NETINFO> directory containing RFCs and IENs, 
Network News, Protocols, and other files of network interest; and services such
as NIC/Query and the WHOIS server and data base will only be accessible on 
SRI-NIC.  (PLEASE NOTE: This host is on a high-numbered IMP.  Unfortunately, 
those of you who are on machines which have not fully implemented 96-bit 
leaders will be unable to reach the NIC.  All I can suggest is that you 
complain to your local systems programmer.  I have pleaded with my Project 
Monitor for a low-numbered IMP to no avail!)

We also have a new direct-dial phone number - (415) 859-3695.

The NIC gets a large volume of network mail.  In the past most of it has been 
directed to FEINLER@SRI-KL.  From now on we would like to ask any of you 
sending mail to the NIC to address it to.....NIC@SRI-NIC.  This will keep me 
from being a bottleneck, and hopefully will expedite handling of bugs and 
requests for documents or information.  Mail sent to SRI-KL will be forwarded 
for a brief interim period.

I would like to take this opportunity to introduce you to the NIC staff.  These
are the people behind NIC@SRI-NIC:

   Mary Dyer - Technical editor
   Ken Harrenstien - Systems programmer
   Hal Huntley - Technical editor
   Johanna Landsbergen (Jojo) - Programming assistant
   Francine Perillo - Library assistant
   Glenn Sherwood - Consultant
   Vic White - Systems programmer

We hope you will bear with us as we settle into our new 'digs', and  please 
contact us if we can be of service to you.

Regards,
Elizabeth Feinler, Mgr.
Network Information Center

P.S.  Please don't try to use SRI-NIC before June 24th.
