             TCP/IP Conversion Effective 1 Jan 83

---------------------------------------------------------------------


1. The network  transition to exclusive  use of TCP/IP  took place  as
scheduled.  The  net is  up with  relatively few  NCP-only  exemptions
granted.  Individual host  TCP implementation  problems have  occurred
and  exemptions  were  granted  to  those  sites  experiencing  severe
disruption of service.  The exemptions are temporary and firm  cutover
dates (to TCP-only operation) have been published (see Table 1).

2.  To  support those  users  whose hosts  are  still using  NCP,  the
ARPANET terminal access controllers (TAC) will continue to support NCP
through January 1983.  This will allow hosts using NCP an  opportunity
to transition  to TCP  without  seriously disrupting  remote  terminal
service.  Terminal users will have to enter an additional command when
connecting to a TAC in order to  communicate with NCP hosts.  As of  1
Feb 83, all TACs will run TCP/IP only.

3.  The University of Delaware (UDEL)  has agreed to serve as a  mail-
forwarding relay  during the  transition  period.  A  modification  to
normal addressing is necessary as described below:	

   a.  A TCP user with mail for an NCP user will address
        TO: <Account-Name>.<NCP-HostName>@UDEL-RELAY. 
           Example:  PVAYDA.OFFICE-10@UDEL-RELAY.
       Important:  The origin host must be TCP.

   b.  An NCP user with mail for a TCP user will address
        TO: <Account-Name>.<TCP-HostName>@UDEL-TCP.
           Example:  DHENRY.BBNC@UDEL-TCP. 
       Important:  The origin host must be NCP.

   c.  UDEL will  return incorrectly addressed  messages.  Should  the
destination host protocol not be known, or be transitioning, UDEL will
complete the transaction  (TCP to TCP, or  NCP to NCP).  The  critical
point is the correct protocol of the sender.

   d.   POC  at  UDEL is Mr. Brendan  Reilly,  (302) 738-1266,
Reilly@UDEL-RELAY.

4.  The list of TCP exemptions is included for your information (Table
1) to enable effective use of the UDEL relay.

5.  Should  unforeseen  problems  result  in a  need  to  request  NCP
enablement,  Newsletter   No.  19   establishes  reclama   procedures.
Briefly, reclamas  should  provide your  justification,  schedule  for
TCP-only implementation, source of TCP  conversion effort, and a  list
of the hosts you  communicate with. TCP exemptions  are granted on  an
individual host basis  and each host  administrator must  individually
request NCP  enablement.  POC  for all  such requests  is Major  Bruce
Sweeny, DCACODEB627@BBN-TENEXB, or by phone, (703) 285-5020.

6. Thank you for your patience and cooperation.
