                       ARPANET NEWSLETTER

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Liaison,

It is time to remind all of you that Extended (New) Leader format must 
be implemented by all ARPANET hosts as of January 1, 1981.  Although we 
can determine that the host interface software is working with the 
extended leaders, we cannot determine if application software has been 
changed to accommodate the extended leader format.  Please review 
application software packages on your host(s) with the proper contacts 
to be sure the packages are compatible with the new format, thus 
avoiding cutover problems.

Enclosed is a list of hosts that are not yet supporting Extended (New) 
Leader format for your information.  The list was compiled by Bob Hinden
at BBN.

Again I urge you to review any problems you may have locally with 
extended leader incompatibilities, and to be prepared to make the 
cutover by Jan. 1.

Maj. Joe Haughney
DCA
