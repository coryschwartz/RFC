ATTENTION - NETWIDE TCP EXPERIMENT - NOV 15, DEC 13 & 14, 1982

On November 15, December 13, and December 14, 1982, for a 24-hour period
each day (00:01 to 24:00 EST), a TCP-only experiment will be conducted 
on the ARPANET.  During this period, the ARPANET IMPS will be disabled 
from sending NCP Host-to-Host traffic, and network traffic measurements 
will be taken.

The method that will be used to disable the NCP trafic will be for the 
IMPS to reject any messages submitted by the hosts that use link 0 
(i.e., that have bits 65-72 in the 1822 leader set to zero).  If an IMP 
receives such a message, it will respond to the host with a type 7 
(destination host or IMP dead) subtype 3 (communication with the 
destination host is administratively prohibited) message (see BBN Report
1822, page 3-30).  This response is consistent with the IMP's present 
behavior, and this is similar to the method that was used when short 
leaders were removed from the network.

During the test, hosts that are running NCP and TCP in parallel with 
shared remote host state tables may encounter some problems unless their
NCP is turned off for the duration.  Several TOPS-20 TCP implementations
fall into this category, and other hosts may as well.  TCP-only hosts 
should encounter no difficulties, and NCP-only hosts will be unable to 
use the network.

It is important to note that this method of disabling NCP traffic will 
be used once the network pases the TCP-only date next year (1 Jan 83), 
so your host software should (if it cannot now) be able to correctly 
recognize and handle type 7, subtype 3 messages from the IMP.

Any technical questions concerning the test may be direct to Andrew 
Malis (Malisatbbn-unix), (617) 497-3419.  Any administrative questions 
should be directed to DCA Code B645 (formerly Code 252) 
(DCACODE252ATUSC-ISI).

SPONSORS MEETING TO BE HELD DEC. 2, 1983

The Sponsors Meeting will be held on Dec. 2, 1983 in Washington, D.C.  
Time and place to be announced in a future message.

We anticipate spending some time at the meeting on the subject of the 
DDN, particularly as it affects the ARPANET and the Sponsors.  We would 
also like to include other imporatant topics, time permitting.  
Suggested topics for discussion, along with their relative importance, 
who should present them, and about how much time is required should be 
sent to us here at DCA (GPARK@BBNC).  The agenda will be prepared from 
these suggestions.  We may not be able to cover everything, but will try
to include the things which you consider most important.

Regards,

Glynn Parker
DCA Code B627

2ND REMINDER - SMTP MUST BE IMPLEMENTED BY 1 JAN 1983

SMTP will become the official network mail protocol.  All hosts with 
mail service should plan on implementing SMTP by 1 Jan. 1983 for sending
and receiving network mail.  SMTP is completely separate from FTP, and 
is handled by a distinct server.  This is different in detail from the 
current mail-handling procedures.  Questions about implementation of the
mail protocol should be addressed to Jon Postel (POSTEL@ISIF).

In addition, all hosts must be able to understand the 4-octet host 
addressing scheme outlined in RFC-796 and RFC-810.

TAC USER GUIDE ONLINE AT THE NIC

Robin Clifford of BBN has just published a revised TAC User Guide (BBN 
Rept. 4780, Oct. 1982).  Contact your local TAC Liaison first for 
hardcopies.  If the TAC Liaison is out of copies, contact Judy Gordon at
BBN (jgordon@bbn-unix) on the East Coast and NIC@SRI-NIC on the West 
coast for hardcopies.  The User Guide is also online on SRI-NIC 
(10.0.0.73) in the file <NETINFO>TAC-USER-GUIDE.DOC.  It can be FTPed to
your local host using username=anonymous, pw=guest.

AAAI CALL FOR PAPERS

The 3rd National Conference on Artificial Intelligence will be held in 
Washington, D.C., Aug. 22-26, 1983 at the Washington Hilton.  Authors 
are invited to submit short papers on original research covering any 
aspect of artificial intelligence.  Submit papers to:  American 
Association for Artificial Intelligence, 445 Burgess Drive, Menlo Park, 
Ca 94025, (415) 328-3123, AAAI-OFFICE@SUMEX-AIM.  Program Chairman is 
Michael R. Genesereth, Computer Science Dept., Stanford University, 
Stanford, CA, (415) 497-0324, CSD.Genesereth@SU-SCORE.  Watch your 
electronic bulletin board for further details.
