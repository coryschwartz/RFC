             TOPIC:  - Vint Cerf leaves DARPA

---------------------------------------------------------------------

To all my friends and colleagues in the DARPA/DoD community:

As many of you now know, I have accepted a new position with MCI 
Telecommunications beginning on November 1.  I will be responsible for 
data network development.  I will leave DARPA on October 15 (leaving 2 
weeks to clean my basement...).  I will remain in the Washington area, 
so I will be reachable in person if necessary.

My association with DARPA began in 1967 at UCLA when I worked on a 
computer performance monitoring project sponsored by DARPA.  Shortly 
thereafter, I worked with Len Kleinrock on the ARPANET Network 
Measurement Center and with Steve Crocker, Jon Postel, the BBN guys, and
a lot of you out there on the ARPANET protocols.  At Stanford, I began 
work on a project started by Bob Kahn called the Internet Project.  This
effort occupied much of my time at Stanford and, after I came to DARPA, 
much of my time there.  So the last 15 years of my professional career I
count as DARPA years (9 in universities and 6 at DARPA).

It has been a very special honor for me to have worked with all of you. 
Your enthusiasm, expertise, energy and vision have been a source of 
motivation for me both personally and professionally.  I count many of 
you now as special personal friends as a result of our work together.

I will miss the pace of DARPA's world and its special people, 
particularly the guidance, advice and stimulation of Bob Kahn, the 
Director of the Information Processing Techniques Office.  It is indeed 
rare to find anyone with such breadth and depth, and it is a source of 
great pride to me to have worked for and with him for so long.

I can be reached after November 1 at the following address:

MCI Telecommunications Inc.
MCI Building
1133 19th Street NW
Washington, DC 20036

(202) 872-1600

As to electronic access, I am less sure.  My ISI mailbox will be retired
on 1 November, allowing 2 weeks to clean it out.

The Internet Project at DARPA will be handled personally by Bob Kahn. 
The Network Security effort will be the responsibility of Barry Leiner. 
Others not quite fitting into either category should raise any questions
or issues with Bob Kahn.  Queries about ARPANET access, if they must be 
answered by DARPA rather than DCA, should be sent to Mrs. Dona 
McKenney-Vance (McKenney@ISIA).

Technical issues relating to the Internet Project should be raised with 
Dave Clark, the Internet Architect, at MIT (DCLARK@MIT-MULTICS) or with 
Jon Postel, the Internet Numbers CZAR, at ISI (POSTEL@ISIF).  Jon and 
Dave can also help you with any NCP->TCP transition questions.

Documentation on the Internet is available from the NIC (NIC@SRI-NIC).

I want to thank you all for making the last 15 years such memorable ones
for me.  I shall miss you, and I truly hope that our professional and 
personal paths will cross often in the years ahead.

Vint Cerf
