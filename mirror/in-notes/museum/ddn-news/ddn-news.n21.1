   TOPIC:  - Revised Procedures for Requesting New Host Approval
             and Port Activation

   NOTE:  This revision obsoletes procedures outlined in ANEWS-18

------------------------------------------------------------------------

REVISED PROCEDURES FOR REQUESTING NEW HOST APPROVAL AND PORT ACTIVATION:

In DoD Network Newsletter # 18, we established a procedure for 
requesting approval of new hosts on the net and activation of the 
desired IMP port.  This procedure has worked well, and has been helpful 
in maintaining an accurate data base.  We have found some ways of 
improving it, however, and are therefore asking you to follow the 
revised procedure described below rather than that of newsletter 18, 
which is superseded by this newsletter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHERE TO ADDRESS THE REQUEST:  Requests for new host approval and port 
activation, and for host change on an already activated port, should be 
addressed to the following network mailbox:

   HOST-APPROVE@SRI-NIC

WHAT INFORMATION IS NEEDED:  All such requests should contain the 
following information:

   HOST DATA:                             EXAMPLE:
