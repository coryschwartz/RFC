Re: ARPANET NEWS from DCA

Dear Liaison,

Maj. Haughney of the Defense Communications Agency (DCA) has asked me
to distribute the following ARPANET newsletter to all of you.  Will
you please pass it on to administrators and systems people who may not
otherwise see it.  Send questions and replies to DCACODE535@ISI.
Thanks.

Jake

GENTLEPERSONS:

     There are several changes forthcoming to the ARPANET over the
next couple of years which will have considerable impact upon the
ARPANET community.  Since you, the liaisons, are the primary point of
contact for users, DCA believes that it is a good idea to keep the
liaisons better informed of actions that will affect you and your
users over the next few years.  To achieve this goal, DCA will publish
a network newsletter which will provide management and technical
information and guidance to you, the liaisons.  This net message is
DCA's first newsletter.  Future newsletters will be provided through
the ARPANET on an as needed basis.  Widest dissemination of pertinent
information contained in this newsletter to ARPANET users by the
liaisons is requested.

   Maj. Joseph Haughney
   DCA

                          ARPANET NEWSLETTER


---------------------------------------------------------------------

     Over the past eleven years, the ARPANET has grown considerably
and has become the major U. S. Government research and development
communications network.  The ARPANET liaisons have made significant
contributions to the network's success.  Your efforts are voluntary,
but are critical to successful operation of each Host, IMP, and TIP.
Your continued support of the ARPANET is greatly appreciated and will
facilitate continued smooth ARPANET operation.

     To aid you in performance of your duties, DCA will attempt to
provide you with the latest information in network improvements.  This
information is grouped into two major areas: management and technical
improvements.  However, a brief discussion of where we are going with
the ARPANET is in order.

     The ARPANET is still a rapidly growing network.  It provides a
service which is both cost and operationally effective.  We predict
the ARPANET will grow to approximately 100 nodes by 1983, when we will
begin transferring some of the subscribers to DOD's AUTODIN II
network.

     While the ARPANET is quite successful, it does have some
problems.  The basic hardware and software are becoming obsolete.  The
nodes use minicomputers developed in the 1960s which no longer have
sufficient memory and other capabilities to support technical
improvements to the network.  In addition, the ultimate goal of our
planning is to provide for an ARPANET II which will be a virtual
network and make use of several different physical networks (e.g.
AUTODIN II, residual ARPANET, and commercial networks to provide
interconnectivity between users while still maintaining network
transparency.  This goal is subject, as usual, to cost, schedule and
technical constraints.

     The meshing of our immediate problems with our long term goal has
produced the following course of action.  The ARPANET will be
"modernized" over the next three years to eliminate immediate
problems.  We will also develop the capability to readily transfer
ARPANET nodes and users to AUTODIN II, and possibly commercial
networks, when this is financially and operationally feasible.

     Now that we have stated our goal, we will address the various
supporting actions that we are undertaking which will have an impact
on you, the liaisons.




                          MANAGEMENT ACTIONS

ACCESS POLICY

     The ARPANET is not meant to compete with commercial networks.
Commercial networks should be used whenever there is not any
requirement to communicate with ARPANET hosts and/or subscribers.
There have been some developments in work being done on gateways
between commercial networks and the ARPANET.  Some hosts have
implemented such gateways.  However, such interfaces are proscribed
unless specifically authorized by DCA.  Access problems with internet
gateways, as recently evidenced by the illegal access of a Canadian
Firm's computer by someone operating a New York high school's computer
system through a TELENET/DATAPAC gateway, show that technical problems
must still be resolved.  Hence, if you have an unauthorized gateway in
your Host computer, DCA should be informed immediately, and the
gateway terminated or suspended until DCA can review the access
controls for gateways.

     DCA has recently asked the ARPANET Sponsors for a detailed survey
of all ARPANET users.  This survey information will be added to the
Network Information Center (NIC) Identification Data Base.  The reason
for the expanded data base is to provide an all encompassing
description of who, where, and why a user is on the ARPANET.  This
information will be used for planning to move users onto AUTODIN II
and as a validation mechanism for the TIP Log-in program, which we
will discuss later.  To reduce workload on the liaisons, we plan to
send out quarterly updates of the master file which the host and TIP
liaison will be responsible for verifying and updating.  This report
will, hopefully, be initially published in June of 1981.  It will
replace the TIP inventory report which TIP liaisons now send us.  Host
systems which do not have any mechanism for managing backside
terminal/user validation and verification, should establish procedural
or software control mechanisms to obtain the required information.

     You may wonder why we are placing such emphasis on knowing who is
on the ARPANET.  When the network was small, a decentralized
management approach was established due to the nature of the network
and the small community of users. This promoted flexibility and
synergy in network use.  Now that the network has grown to over 66
nodes and an estimated four to five thousand users, flexibility must
be tempered with management control to prevent waste and misuse.  The
decentralized management of network access and resources is still our
objective.  We just want to ensure that we can verify proper resource
utilization and prevent unauthorized penetrations.  We believe that
the data base that we are establishing, can be used as a tool for
improving your and our management control.  We deal in gross
quantities, you deal in the particulars.

     DCA will be publishing a new Host/TIP Liaison Responsibilities
letter in July 1980 which will describe these new reporting
requirements.




TIP LOG IN

     ARPA has let a contract to Bolt Beranek and Newman, Inc. (BBN) to
study and develop, if feasible, a TIP Log-In program and data base.
By mid 1982 this effort should, hopefully, result in a means to
directly control access to TIPS.  The design will take into account
the problems encountered with a previous TIP Log-in effort made on the
ARPANET several years ago.

     The present design suggests an approach where a user would log
into a TIP when he wants access to the network.  The TIP would
transmit the log-in information to a regional data base node, which
would verify the user and validate to the TIP that that user is
allowed network access.  In some cases, this may result in a double
log-in, depending upon the host password system design.  The regional
data bases would be updated on a daily basis from a master data base.
This data base would be constructed based on a permission tree
structure where permissions are delegated down the tree.  For example,
a sponsor would grant permission to a contract monitor to connect a
certain number of users.  The contract monitor would then grant
permissions for that number of users to a contractor, who would then
delegate these permissions to his program manager.  The program
manager could delegate permissions down to the project leader or the
individual users.  When the contract is terminated, the contract
monitor revokes his permission, which deletes the contractor
personnel's access to the ARPANET.

     The previously-mentioned ARPANET NIC Data Base will be used
initially to cross-check the TIP Log-in data base, and hence it's
accuracy is critical to preventing valid users from being temporarily
without service when TIP Log-in is implemented.  The TIP Log-in data
base will be managed by the NIC when it becomes operational.  The TIP
Log-in data base will eventually replace all or part of the NIC data
base, depending upon whether or not we are successful in our
development effort to incorporate terminals which access the network
through hosts into the TIP Log-in software.

     BBN is also studying the feasibility of applying TIP Log-in
mechanisms to host computer users.  Hence, host liaisons should also
ensure that their terminals and users are included in the NIC Data
Base to preclude problems with service, if TIP Log-in is implemented
for the Hosts.

TIP INVENTORY

     For TIP liaisons, we have mentioned that we intend to eliminate
the TIP Quarterly Inventory and replace it with a NIC Data Base
Update. You should be sure of the accuracy of your inputs, because we
intend to structure the TIP buffering mechanism to support only those
TIP ports which are reflected in the NIC Data Base.  All new TIP users
will have to have a complete entry in the NIC Data Base and be
approved by DCA before these users will be permitted access to the
TIP.  NOTE: This procedure includes dial-in users.  Guidelines for
approval and procedures for requesting new user access will be
outlined in the new ARPANET Host/TIP Liaison Responsibilities letter
which will be sent to you in July 1980 as mentioned above, and the TIP
buffering allocation scheme will be enforced as of 1 February 1981.




96 BIT HEADERS

     DCA recently announced by net note that only 96-bit headers will
be accepted by the network nodes as of 1 January 1981.  This date
still stands.  Users, when reviewing the impact of the header change
upon them, should also review their applications software to ensure
their compatibility with 96-bit headers.  We have received some
queries from liaisons who did not realize the possible impacts on
their applications software of the 96-bit headers.

LIAISON MEETINGS

     In order to improve information dissemination between DCA and the
liaisons, we plan to hold a series of one day meetings for liaisons.
These meetings will cover the items discussed in this newsletter plus
any topics, problems, etc., that the liaisons wish to discuss.  These
meetings will occur in the Fall of 1980.  Tentative scheduling for the
meetings are:

GEOGRAPHICAL AREA   DATE       MEETING SITE

New England         21 Nov     To be determined
Washington D.C.     18 Nov     DCA Headquarters
West Coast          30 Sept    Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, CA
Mid West             3 Dec     St Louis Area

     Proposed agenda items, comments, etc., should be forwarded by net
mail to DCACODE535@ISI no later than 15 September 80.

SPONSOR RELATIONS

     The ARPANET has Sponsors who represent the various communities of
interest found on the network.  These Sponsors handle funding and
management of community resources.  DCA Code 535 attempts to assist
the liaisons whenever possible with problem areas and questions that
are not resolved by the NCC or the NIC.  However, your first point of
contact in such situations, should be your ARPANET Sponsor.  In some
cases, the Sponsor may still refer the liaison to DCA.  However, the
Sponsor can sometimes handle the situation within his own resources.
Such contacts can also keep the Sponsor better aware of the services
being provided to his users and enable him to more effectively
represent them.  In other words, it pays to know your Sponsor and work
with him.

CIRCUIT FORECASTING

     AT&T has stated a twelve to eighteen month lead time to provide
wideband 50/56KB service.  This lead time may be even longer in
California.  To provide timely service, they have asked us to forecast
our requirements as much as possible.  These forecasts are not firm
orders, but are used by AT&T for planning purposes to estimate such
things as modem production requirements and transmisssion overbuilds.
If you have, or know of, any new node or high speed VDH requirements
which are being contemplated or discussed, please let DCA know
immediately. These requirements may just be in the discussion stage
and unfunded.  However, by including such possible requirements in our
forecast, we hope to reduce circuit, and hence node/VDH installation
lead times, to a more reasonable time frame.





                              TECHNICAL

NEW ARPANET PROTOCOLS

     The Office of the Secretary of Defense has directed that a set of
DOD Standard Protocols be used on all Department of Defense
communications networks. This directive applies to the ARPANET.  The
ARPANET Host protocols will be replaced over the next three years with
the new DOD Standard Protocol set.  This has a direct impact on host
operating systems and some applications programs that use the ARPANET.
The ARPANET Network Control Program (NCP) will be replaced by two DOD
protocols, the DOD Standard Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and
the Internet Protocol (IP).  ARPANET FTP and TELNET protocols will
also be updated and standardized.  Planning for this transition is
still under development.  The NIC plans to publish for DCA a new
Protocol Handbook by the end of this year, which will provide details
on the new protocol specifications.

     DCA also intends to provide an ARPANET online protocol
clearinghouse which will provide a repository for already developed
implementations of these protocols and act as a clearinghouse to
resolve problem areas and coordinate new protocol implementation
development.  As soon as the planning is finished, we will publish the
details.  In the meantime, unless you have already begun development
of the protocols, you may want to start budgeting for the protocol
software development for your host.  NOTE: H316 TIP protocol
development is being addressed by an ARPA contract with BBN, and
involves a hardware addition to the TIP which will be discussed later.
DOD Standard Protocol Development for the PLURIBUS TIP is still being
studied as to the most cost and operationally effective way to
implement the protocols.

C/30 PROCURMENT

     The new BBN C/30 IMP and TIP can now be ordered.  These computers
are direct replacements for the Honeywell 316 hardware, and run the
existing IMP and TIP software in an emulation mode.  The C/30 costs
from $20,000 to $35,000 depending upon configuration.  These new
systems will begin to be installed as new nodes in late fall of 1980.
We hope to eventually replace all Honeywell equipment with the C/30s
depending, of course, on funding availability.  Unless there is a need
for a node which requires a large amount of processing power, the BBN
C/30 or equivalent will be the only type of node hardware procurred in
the future.

     The C/30 will also be used to support the DOD Standard TCP and
Internet Protocol implementation in the TIP.  This will be
accomplished by removing the IMP software from the H316 TIP and
placing it in a C/30.  The removal of the IMP software will make room
in the TIP for the installation of the programs to support the new and
existing protocols in the TIP.  All H316 TIPs will require
installation of the C/30 IMP to support the DOD protocols by late
1983.  DCA will contact the Sponsors when an installation schedule is
known.  Sponsor's will approve C/30 procurement.  However, for those
sites which must fund for hardware node procurement, approximately
$20,000 should be budgeted in Fy 1981 or 1982, to support procurement
of the C/30 Protocol TIP expansion hardware.




SUMMARY

     We have attempted to address items which will have a direct
impact on liaisons and their users for the next few years.  If you
have any questions on these subjects, drop DCA and your Sponsor a net
note.  Due to the fact that some of our actions are still in the
planning and development stage, some of the information that we
provided you is nebulous.  However, at least, you have an approximate
idea of what is planned for the network.  We will try to provide the
specifics as they develop and incorporate them in our next newsletter.
If you have any items that you wish addressed in the next newsletter,
please let us know.  We will attempt to address them wherever
possible.
