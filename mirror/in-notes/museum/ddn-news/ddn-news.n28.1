                FURTHER DETAILS ON THE MILNET/ARPANET SPLIT

Introduction

This   newsletter   continues   the   discussion   of   the   upcoming
ARPANET/MILNET split started in DDN Newsletter 26 and continued in DDN
Newsletter 27.  If you have not yet read these, you are encouraged  to
do so.  Most hosts keep a publicly accessible local copy, and they can
also   be    found    at    SRI-NIC   [10.0.0.73]    in    the    file
<DDN-NEWS>DDN-NEWS-X.TXT, where "x" is the newsletter number.  SRI-NIC
allows FTP login with the username "anonymous" and password "guest".

Testing the Logical Split

The logical  split  of  the existing  ARPANET  into  the  Experimental
ARPANET and the MILNET  is a major  change which requires  substantual
testing to insure it will be accomplished as an orderly process.

ALL HOSTS AND USERS will be impacted. The ARPANET will change from one
network into two, and communications with hosts on the other net  will
require a knowledge of internet procedures.  MILNET  hosts will use  a
new network number (Network  26).  (Details of procuring  updated host
tables from the Network Information Center will be covered in a forth-
coming newsletter.)

The MILNET and the ARPANET will remain connected via five mail bridges
(internet gateways augmented  with a load-splitting  mechanism and  an
access control filter). The load-splitting mechanism works as follows.
Each bridge will contain  a table assigning  the "default" bridge  for
each host to use in sending traffic  to the other network.  If a  host
sends a  message  via the  wrong  bridge  and its  default  bridge  is
operational, the host will receive an ICMP redirect message telling it
which alternate gateway (i.e., default bridge) to use.  This mechanism
allows the five gateways to  balance the internet traffic.  After  the
initial default  assignment, if  one of  the bridges  is found  to  be
carrying  a  disproportionate  share  of  the  load,  then  the   host
assignment table will  be modified.  No changes to  host software  are
required.  As  long  as a  host  supports  ICMP,  the  host-to-gateway
protocol, it can  make full  use of  the bridges  without knowing  its
default bridge assignment in advance.

A schedule has been developed for  testing prior to the actual  split.
The goals of this testing are to:

     o Verify the mail bridge load-splitting mechanism and
       access control filter.

     o Test host TCP/IP and ICMP implementations.

     o Test the entire system networkwide.

Initial testing will use the testbed environment already available  at
BBN.  BBN has a local  ARPANET-clone network, the BBNNET (Network  8),
which is connected to the ARPANET via a gateway.  During daytime hours
the BBNNET passes about 50% as much traffic as does the ARPANET,  with
the existing gateway passing about 1,000,000 packets during an average
day, with about 80,000 packets per hour passing through it during peak
hours.  This represents  a significantly heavier  load than will  pass
through any  of  the five  mail  bridges, therefore  the  BBNNET  will
provide a realistic test environment.

The testing schedule is:

15 June:  Two additional gateways between the ARPANET and the BBNNET
          are installed.

30 June:  The gateway load-splitting mechanism is operational.

15 June to 15 August:  Gateway load-splitting and routing between
          the ARPANET and the BBNNET are verified.

To aid users in verifying  their capabilities to communicate with  the
MILNET, the  first MILNET  host to  receive net  number 26  will be  a
public news host  implemented  on a C/70,  which will allow  anonymous
logins and  will  contain  information  of  general  interest  to  the
ARPANET/MILNET community.

In addition, to assist TAC users, a TACNEWS service will be  provided.
By typing "@n" to the TAC, a TAC user will automatically be  connected
to the public news host wherever  it may exist without having to  know
its actual internet address.

Following are some of the major milestones of the Split.

1 July - 1 September:  The mail bridges between ARPANET and MILNET
          are installed.

15 July:  The C70 public news host is installed as the first host in
          the  MILNET COI.  Also, a  second MILNET interface will be 
          added to SRI-NIC.  Host managers  and  technical personnel
          should now  try to connect to the  C/70 news host  via the
          mail bridges in order to test their  ICMP implementations.

28 July - 2 August:  Network technical liaison meetings in:
          Los Angeles and San Francisco, Cambridge and Washington DC

1 September - 1 October:  The NIC  maintains the old  (ARPANET-only)
          and  the new  (ARPANET/MILNET)  host tables  in  parallel.
          During  this period  MILNET hosts may  voluntarily  change
          to Network No. 26 provided their changeover is coordinated
          with the NIC to permit timely update of the official  host
          tables.  Two full day  tests will occur, during which  the
          network will enforce the split, and hosts must use the new
          host tables.

4 October:  The logical split occurs.  Network IMPs will enforce the
          proper COI for each host, and network addressing   will be
          updated to reflect the split.

1 Febuary 1984:  Access control filters  are implemented in the mail
          bridges.  Although  this capability has  existed  for some
          time, its implementation is deferred to reduce the problems
          associated with the logical split on 4 October.

QUESTION:

From: Brian McCune <mccune@aids-unix>
To: nic@nic
Subject: ICMP

Your latest newsletter seemed to imply that without ICMP running
in our machine (AIDS-UNIX), we couldn't send mail to a host on
MILNET (e.g., RADC-TOPS20).  Is this so, or couldn't we
send a message to another ARPANET host that knows how to
relay the message on in the right format?  (This other host might not
be an actual gateway, just an intermediate translator.)

Brian,

It is true that you could send mail through such a forwarding
host, but using such a scheme has many problems, including: 

- you couldn't receive any return mail without including in all
  of your mail a return path back through the forwarding host. 

- You would need the official permission from the administators
  of your forwarding host before using it in this manner. 

- You would be unable to participate in any TELNET or FTP
  transactions with hosts on the other net (or on ANY other
  network besides your own).  This is going to become
  increasingly important as many current ARPANET hosts are being
  moved to local networks at their sites, and then communicating
  with the ARPANET via gateways.  Here at BBN, for instance, we
  have about 30 hosts on various local networks that access the
  ARPANET via gateways - the host that I am typing on at this
  moment falls into this category.  We are able to save many
  thousands of dollars a month that we would otherwise have to
  pay to provide each of these hosts with a direct ARPANET host
  port.  I understand the ISI has even more local hosts behind
  gateways. 

- In the future, DCA may "cut off" hosts that do not fully
  support TCP/IP, including ICMP, in the same manner that
  NCP-only hosts have been removed from the net.  Any
  implementation of IP that does not include ICMP is incomplete
  (read the IP spec if you don't believe me). 

In the end, you will be saving yourself much long-term grief by
bringing up ICMP.  You are a UNIX site; there are at least 10
different UNIX implementations of IP that include ICMP.  I'm sure
that you could do a lot of copying of existing code, if you
couldn't just install one of these outright.

Andy Malis
