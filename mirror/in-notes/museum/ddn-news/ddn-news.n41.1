		 	     FOREWORD


As most of you know, we have undertaken a greatly accelerated node
installation schedule which, as a following article shows, is largely
on schedule.  We continue to have difficulties obtaining access
circuitry and there are insufficient host interfaces available in the
market place.  The case for obtaining access circuits is not resolved
and we are continuing to try different methods to obtain service.  With
respect to host interfaces, increasingly more vendors are supporting
the set DoD protocol.  The following article shows the schedule for
those DDN PMO contracted interfaces.

The DDN is being built for the Services and Agencies, not for DCA.
Accordingly, I am most interested that you be kept informed as to what
we are doing with your money and your requirements.  I think there are
a variety of ways to do this and this newsletter is but one of them.  A
further way is to make the data on which I base my decisions available
to you.  A primary effort in this vein is in putting the URDB in an
easier manipulated DBMS and making it available through the DDN.  We
completed this last month.  I am gathering 19 in-house data bases
currently on DBase III and intend to put them in ADABAS for network	
access.

We have lost several key individuals this past summer who were
pioneers in developing the DDN and in determining the scope and
direction of our efforts.  The most serious loss was the death of Dr.
Tom Harris who was the Division Chief for Engineering Development and
Acquisition.  Dr. Harris was an expert in network topology, was a whiz
in translating the requirements of an individual system into the DDN
architecture, and intimately knew packet switching advantages and
limitations.  Thus, he was a key technical advisor to the Director, DCA
and to OSD as well as being a pillar of competence in the DDN.  His
loss will be almost impossible to replace.

The PCS of the entire military representation of the User Integration
Division took place this summer.  Of the nine persons in that division
a year ago, only three remain today.  The good news is that the Services
are providing outstanding replacements and they are beginning to
report in now.

In July of this year, a team of Management Experts from the Navy
visited the DDN PMO at the request of LTGEN Powers to assess the PMO
and to make recommendations for increased efficiency.  In addition to
spending about a month in the PMO, the team visited several of our
users as well as our contractors.  The results of that visit have been
published in a report that I intend to distribute to the Services in
the near future.  Among their recommendations was a suggested
reorganization for the PMO which would integrate DDN, AUTODIN, and
AMPE, and an increase in resources devoted to planning.  Most of their
recommendations require additional manpower in that none of their
suggestions contained a recommendation that we stop doing any
particular function.

 		       1.  DDN GROWTH PROJECTIONS

The following graphs illustrate the growth that the DDN has
experienced and shows that even a greater rate of growth is needed to
satisfy projected requirements.

    	                HOST PROJECTIONS END FY86

        	Operational		     308
		Within Lead Time	     307
		Awaiting Access Lines        217
		Awaiting Trunk Circuits        0
		Awaiting DDN Nodes             0
		Awaiting Host Interfaces     500 (est.)
		Awaiting User Action	    2218

			TOTAL               3550	


The present projection for hosts requiring connections to the DDN is
3550 by the end of FY86.  As can be observed from the [above figures],
monumental efforts will be required to satisfy the requirement.  The
extent to which the requirement will be satisfied depends on many
actions by many organizations.  The services and agencies must provide  
feeder TSRs to the DDN PMO; the DDN PMO must prepare TSRs for the access
lines and install the packet switches; DECCO must contract for the
circuits; the common carriers must install the circuits; and the
subscribers must actively pursue the acquisition of host interfaces to
connect to the DDN.

Relatively slow growth was experienced prior to mid FY85.  This is
mostly attributed to two problems: the common carriers have been very
slow in circuit installation, and the dearth of vendor supported host
interfaces.  The DDN PMO is agressively seeking solutions to these
problems.  The DDN PMO has contracted for host interfaces for the
common host families as well as the development of a host front-end
device (HFEP) under the Network Access Component (NAC) acquisition.   

The solution to the circuit installation problem has shown to be more
elusive (see circuit projection--chart following) due in large measure
to the AT&T divestiture.  However, all circuit acquisition alternatives
are being investigated.

			       FISCAL YEAR

To satisfy the projected requirement for host connections, the DDN PMO
took action in February 1985 to accelerate the packet switch
installations.  The preceding chart shows that at the current rate,
there will be sufficient packet switches to satisfy projected host
requirements.

		       [CIRCUIT PROJECTIONS GRAPH
	               AVAILABLE IN HARDCOPY ONLY;
			       CONTACT NIC]

This chart graphically illustrates the circuit installation problem.
While the DDN PMO has processed approximately 2500 TSRs from the end of
February 1985 to the end of July 1985, only approximately 500 circuits
were installed and approximately 400 circuit requirements had expired
service dates.  As can be observed from the Installation curve, the
installation rate must increase dramatically from 95 to 350 per month to
meet the projected requirement.

The chart, while not quantified, illustrates how data is expected to
grow relative to voice.  The chart is included to add credence to the
belief of the DDN PMO that the growth shown on the preceding host,
packet switch and circuit projections will continue well beyond FY86.

		   2.  DDN NODE INSTALLATlON SCHEDULE

DCA message 281941Z FEB 85, Subject: DDN Node Installation Schedule
announced a schedule of node installations for the period January 1985
through April 1986.

A total of 50 nodes were scheduled for installation by the end of July
1985.  As of 31 July 1985, the following was achieved against the
schedule:

	New Nodes Installed and Operational     18
	New Nodes Installed (Awaiting lines 
		            for activation)     24
	New Nodes with Installation Underway     5
	New Nodes Slipped to August 1985         3
					       ---	
					        50

The eight nodes referenced above as having installation underway or
having slipped into August 1985 for installation represent a
shortcoming in terms of schedule.  This is indicative of the
difficulty of doing business in a different way.  As we progress into
the schedule, the rough edges are smoothing and a higher degree of
success in node installation and activations is expected.

Associated with the installation of nodes is the required survey of
prospective node sites.  A total of 60 node site surveys were scheduled
for the period February through July 1985.  Of that number, 56 have
been completed.  Four site surveys were not conducted because the
candidate node site from the present node installation schedule was
removed.

Activation of installed nodes is running ahead of last year by count,
but this is still significantly behind the desired level.  Ideally, all
nodes would be activated upon installation; however, acquisition of
high speed digital and wideband trunks requires an excessively long
lead time.  A high percentage of node activations will initially be
classed operational only as a result of being single connected to a
colocated or previously-existing, operational node.

On several occasions, letters have been sent to both ATT
Communications and ATT Information Systems, our principal supplier of
leased lines, identifying those inter-switch trunk lines which we
consider absolutely critical to the activation of nodes through this
schedule.  They have acknowledged receipt of the letters and stated
their understanding of the need and support of the current effort.  It
remains to be seen if this produces positive results.

Following is a recap of the installation status of nodes scheduled for
installation from January through July 1985:

	    3.  MILNET IMPS UPGRADED TO C/3OE CONFIGURATION

The DDN MILNET completed the upgrade to C/3OE at all deployed nodes
worldwide on 5 May 85.  This hardware upgrade, together with the
enhancement to IMP and monitoring center software programs now
completing development, will permit simultaneous connection of all
authorized types of host interfaces to any node, thereby greatly
improving efficiency of host access to the network.  The upgrade expanded
the IMP RAM memory from 64K words to 256K words.  In addition, microcode
and I/O port expansions were also done at many sites.  In all, 87
operational IMPS were upgraded in a three month period.  This was
accomplished by scheduling all work at the time of a quarterly
preventative maintenance visit by BBNCC Field Service.  Except for
very few instances, all nodes were upgraded without significant impact
to users and was in every way a professionally executed project due
principally to the efforts of Ms. Liz Walb, BBNCC C/3OE Upgrade Action
Officer, and BBNCC Field Service.

C/3OE Upgrades are being planned for the WINCS and ARPANET in the near
future. (LTC Bruce Sweeny, B647, (703) 285-5007, (V) 356-5007.)


	4.  DDN TRUNKS TO BE ROUTED OVER THE DEFENSE COMMERCIAL
		   TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORK (DCTN)

The DDN plans to use DCTN for service from Node site to Node site.  The
DDN PMO has identified 30 interswitch trunks (IST) as candidates for
routing over DCTN beginning in 1986.  These ISTs will be totally
terrestrial with end-to-end (from node to node) service.  DCTN will
provide an interface to the DDN that is totally compatible with those
used on the network today (e.g., DATAPHONE (R) DIGITAL SERVICE).
(Charles F. Russell B627, (703) 285-5102, (V) 356-5102.)

			PLANS FOR PUERTO RICO	

The DDN plans to have two new 50/56 Kbps backbone interswitch trunks
(IST) to Puerto Rico with the installation of I-S/A AMPE.  These trunks
will be associated with the classified segment of the DDN (DISNET).
Although end locations cannot be identified at this time, major
communications facilities on the CONUS East Coast are the most obvious
candidates for the mainland connections.  (Charles F. Russell, B627, 
(703) 285-5l02, (V) 356-5102.)

		PLANS FOR THE SOUTHERN REGION OF EUROPE

The DDN has identified requirements into the Southern Region of
Europe (Spain, Greece, Italy and Turkey) for 50 Kbps interswitch trunks
(IST) coming into/exiting these countries.  Specific point-to-point
connectivity cannot be determined until we have a more complete set
of user requirements.  We need at least three wideband (50 Kbps) trunks
from each major military installation in the region and up to eight 50
Kbps trunks at satellite ground stations.  Diverse routing is also
required for survivability of the DDN. (Charles F. Russell, B627, 
(703) 285-5102, (V) 356-5102.)

		  PLANS FOR CENTRAL AMERICA--PANAMA

As part of the Information System Architecture/Integration Plan-Panama,
the DDN specified for two 50/56 Kbps Interswitch trunks each for
MILNET, DISNET, DODIIS and WINCS coming into/exiting Panama.  The DDN
is the driving force in acquiring a leased satellite communications
system between Fort Belvoir, Va. and Corozal, Panama.  Host and terminal
access lines will be required to support valid user requirements in
that area when they have been identified.  The TSR submission requested
a September 85 activation of the T-1 pipe between these two points.
However, delays in acquiring this service have extended the
availability date into early CY 1986. (Charles F. Russell, B627, 
(703) 285-5102, (V) 356-5102.)


		   5.  DDN TRANSMISSION REQUIREMENTS

The DDN PMO has identified 43 interswitch trunks (IST) that are
required for DDN expansion.  We had discussed our requirements with
other DCSO organizations and pointed out our need for diverse routing
and specific needs in this area (trunk-by-trunk).  We put our IST
requirements in a priority list, by their urgency, for
coordination/validation.  However, only 12 out of the 43 IST's have
been forwarded to JCS for out-of-cycle validation over MILSATCOM
facilities.  All other IST requirements will be over commercial
facilities.

			  6.  DDN E & I MANUAL

The first version (dated 8 March 1985) of the DDN Engineering and
Installation Manual for classified networks has been released.
Subsequent to its release, the DDN PMO hosted a review conference at BBN
in Cambridge, Mass.  As a result of this conference, the manual will be
reorganized as a collection of topical documents, probably a series
of DCA Circulars.  Some guidance regarding the Services' host/terminal
sites will be given, DDN requirements for Red/Black grounding will be
described, and all sections will be expanded to some degree.

The present manual will be used pending final document development.  A
companion manual for unclassified networks is already being produced.
The reorganized and expanded manual set is due for distribution in
the May/June 1986 time frame.  (Mr. Darryl Henry, (7O3) 285-5038,
(V) 356-5038, DHENRY@DDN1.)


         7.  PACKET SWITCH NODE (PSN) RELEASE 5--RELEASE OVERVIEW

The Packet Switch Node (PSN) Software Release 5 Overview (PSN R5) for
the C/3OE processor was conditionally approved by the DDN
Configuration Control Board (CCB) on 20 June 1985 pending final
approval of documentation.  PSN R5 contains the following enhancements
over the X.25 PSN R4: supports up to 44 host connections to the C/3OE,
supports up to 500 concurrent X.25 virtual circuits vice 150, collects
usage of X.25 Virtual Circuits and passes it to the NOC, allows for
"logical addressing", allows for networks consisting of up to 255
PSN's, allows the NOC to control modems and other devices depending
upon the levels at specific interface pins and allows X.25 and 1822
HDH hosts to be homed to the same packet switch.  (Mike Corrigan,
B612, (703) 285-5030, (V) 356-5030.)


        8.  PACKET SWITCH NODE (PSN) RELEASE 6--RELEASE OVERVIEW

The Packet Switch Node (PSN) Software Release 6 Overview (PSN R6) for
the C/3OE processor has been approved by the DDN Configuration Control
Board.  The release itself is PSN R6 which offers the following
enhancements over PSN R5: Standard Service X.25 interface in
conjunction with support for interoperablity between Standard service
hosts and 1822 hosts.  X.25 Closed User Group (CUG) support, full
compliance with FIPS 1041 requirements for X.25 packet switching
networks with the availability of the "CUG" facility, support for X.75
lnternetwork Gateways, global definition of a default window and
packet sizes other than the X.25 standard defaults.  (Mike Corrigan, B612, 
(703) 285-5030, (V) 356-5030.)


		    9.  DDN SOFTWARE PATCH RELEASES

Effective 1 August, software patches to all DDN software releases will
be distributed via a Monthly Software Update (MSU) tape.  This tape
will be a cumulative tape containing all the Configuration Control
Group (CCG) approved patches for all the software releases.  The MSU
tape will be updated monthly with patches approved by the CCG; cutoff
date for adding patches will be the first Tuesday of the month.  The
tape will be identified by the year and sequentially numbered (e.g.
85-1, 85-2).  The sequential number has no relationship to the month
since there will be some months when no patches are approved by the
CCG.  Automatic shipment of the tape will only be to the ARPANET,
CONUS MILNET, European MILNET, and Pacific MILNET (when operational)
Monitoring Centers.  The special networks supported by DDN will be
advised when the MSU tape contains patches for the software being
utilized.  By then they should forward a request to CONUS MILNET
Monitor Center (CMMC) who will generate the required software cassette

		         12.  MILNET TAC AUDIT

DDN Management Bulletin 26, 30 Jan 85 and DCA AUTODIN message 211531Z
Nov 84 (with amendments) advised that the DDN PMO would be
establishing configuration management for the DDN TACs for a number of
reasons: to provide centralized TAC port allocation, to validate those
connections to TAC ports that were authorized and operational, and to
identify those connections requiring transfer of billing from the
current organization to DDN.  Supporting commands of the TACs were
requested to submit Request for Service (RFS)/Feeder
Telecommunications Service Request (TSR) to justify and validate the
current port connections.  This was to be accomplished by 1 May 85.  The
DDN PMO also advised that any connections not validated would be
disabled effective 15 May 85.

Effective 1 Aug 85, all TAC port connections that have not been
validated by an RFS/Feeder TSR will be disabled.  Ten TACs per week
will be selected for this action, until all the TACs have been
covered.

The DDN PMO will accept requests to stay a port disablement for 60
days to allow for submission of the appropriate RFS/Feeder TSR.  Ten
days after port disablement, the DDN PMO will take action to
disconnect the circuit and remove any equipment from the node site, as
appropriate, providing no arrangements to the contrary have been made
with the PMO.

Effective 1 Aug 85, problems associated with the TAC connection should
be referred to the MILNET Manager, LT Fennig, DCA/B646, (703) 285-5230,
(V) 356-5230.  (Mr. Jack Snively, B646, (703) 285-5227, (V) 356-5227.)


		   13.  WIN COMMUNICATIONS SUBSYSTEM

There is action underway to issue a record purpose only
Telecommunications Service Request (TSR) assigning Command
Communications Service Designators (CCSD's) to the existing WINCS
local host access lines.  This action will document the access lines in
the DCA database and allow reporting per DCA Circular 310-55-1.
(Major Steve Rudd, B646, (703) 285-5316, (V) 356-5316.)


		  14.  DDN USER REQUIREMENTS DATA BASE

The DDN User Requirement Data Base (URDB) has been converted to the
ADABAS Data Base Management System (DBMS) effective 31 July 85.  ADABAS
is a more powerful and flexible DBMS than the one used previously.  The
new software provides enhanced data entry and output reports
capability.  Training in use of the new software was conducted 30 and
31 July 85 for users in the Washington, DC area.  Training for other
users will be conducted as required.  It is anticipated that
Services/agencies will now perform URDB data entry using the new
software.  (Ms. Sandi Vest, B616, (703) 285-5335, (V) 356-5335.) 


                       15.  SUBSCRIBER EDUCATION   

In an effort to facilitate subscriber planning for optimum use of the
DDN, DoD communications systems managers and planners may soon receive
timely instruction on DDN engineering and transition during a course
being developed by the Network Strategies, Inc. under contract to the
PMO.  The course will contain tutorial and specific engineering topics
based on actual experience in DDN expansion.

Material planned for inclusion in the course will be presented in four
sections.  The first section outlines the functionality required to
achieve reliable data communications in an internetwork environment.
The perspective is evolutionary, tracing the development of data
communication from early telegraphy to a modern internet such as the
Defense Data Network.  In the second section, basic architectural
concepts are presented and lead to a comparison of the DDN with the
two major commercial architectures: ISO-OSI and Systems Network
Architecture (SNA).  The DDN protocol suite is explored in depth in the
third section, followed by a discussion of the architectural and
functional relationships of the major DDN hardware components.  In the
final section, strategies for transitioning a variety of prototypic
systems and networks, as well as general issues such as internet
addressing, monitoring and control, and security, are discussed in
detail.

It is expected that the course will be available by mid fall 1985.  In
the near future, the PMO will solicit input from the services/agencies
on the course, location and schedules for presentation, and desired
objectives.  (Mr. Vic Russell, B616, (703) 285-5028, (V) 356-5028.)


		   16.  DDN LOGISTIC SUPPORT CONCEPT

After analysis and careful consideration of various support concept
alternatives, the DDN PMO has decided on a support concept for the DDN.
The concept will be competitive contractor logistic support for
on-site and off-site maintenance with contractor furnished spares.  This
concept will be included in the upcoming revision of the Management
Engineering Plan, the Logistic Support Plan (LSP), and other DDN
documents. (Ms. Carolyn Taylor, B635, (703) 285-5444, (V) 356-5444.)
				

                     17.  ARMY DDN SYSTEM ANALYSIS

The Controller of the Headquarters, US Army Information Systems Command,
conducted a DDN System Analysis to evaluate the cost and systems
effectiveness of the DDN Communications service.  The executive summary
of the analysis is quoted below with the concurrence of the
originating organization subject to the following notation: The views,
opinions, and findings contained herein are those of the author and
should not be construed as an official Department of Army policy or
position unless so designated by other official documentation.

	"Executive Summary.  The DDN was developed to provide
	common-user long-haul communications support for data
   	networks.  This study was undertaken to evaluate the
        effectiveness of the DDN in providing this support.
        A comparison of	dedicated leased-line communications
        support	versus DDN support for three candidate DDN networks
        was used as the basis for this evaluation.  The comparison
        showed that DDN	support is not generally cost effective as a
	direct wire-replacement for dedicated leased line networks.
        However, much of the reduced effectiveness of DDN service
        can be attributed to suboptimal utilization of the common-user
	capabilities when used in this fashion.  Including DDN support
        as an integral part of the systems design can increase the
        systems	efficiency and, subsequently, the cost-effectiveness.
        As the Army information	systems manager, USAISC has the inherent
	responsibility for developing and promulgating systems
        architecture which derives maximum effectiveness of the DDN
        in support of Army data	networks."

DCA comments on the analysis were provided as follows:

	"The analysis is generally right on target. There is no
        question that using DDN as a wire replacement is inefficient;
        however, the DDN PMO questions the accuracy of the cost
        advantage of dedicated lines over the worse case DDN tariffs
	that is shown in the analysis.  The case for DDN would be
        even stronger if the current commercial	tariffs were used,
        and if the DDN's potential for reducing the costs of day-to-day
        user management and control of long-haul communications 
	were considered.  Also, DDN affords a system such as ARADS,
        a mobilization mission capability, which dedicated lines 
        never could.

	The conclusions and recommendations presented in the
        analysis should be acted upon as quickly as possible.  DDN
        is ideally suited to the distributed processing goals of the
        Army's Automation Architecture Plan.  It can support the
	centralized batch oriented systems that are prevalent in the
        Army today, but that is much like a multi-function touch tone
        telephone system supporting field and rotary dial telephone
        instruments.  Those existing batch systems will have to undergo
        both hardware and software changes to make effective use of the
	DDN or distributed processing.  However, actions to upgrade or
        replace existing systems have historically tended to avoid
        making any software changes.  The Army cannot begin to realize
        the full potential of DDN or achieve its architectural goals
        of distributed processing until that tendency is changed."

		    18.  DDN LIFE CYCLE COST ESTIMATE

The Defense Data Network (DDN) Program Management Office (PMO) in
coordination with the DCA Comptroller's Office has developed a Life
Cycle Cost Estimate (LCCE) for the DDN program through FY 96.  The cost
estimate was developed by MITRE Corporation as a spreadsheet based model
using LOTUS 1-2-3 as its core system and is intended to run on an IBM
PC.  This approach allows for rapid maintenance and updating of the
estimates as well as utilizing the spreadsheet to perform analysis.  The
LCCE model depicts a detailed work breakdown structure which reflects
the current DDN System Description.  Work breakdown structure cost
elements can be manually updated as necessary or can be generated as
part of a pre-processing routine using the estimated node installation
schedule as an input parameter.  It is anticipated that the LCCE will be
of valuable input to the Program Manager when conducting future cost
assessments of the DDN in addition to being the principle tool in
generating future cost projections of the DDN which are necessary for
the development of the DCA Five Year Program (FYP), Five Year Corporate
Plan (FYCP) and other Planning, Programming, and Budgeting (PPBS)
documents. (Major Larry E. Wheeler, B613, (7O3) 285-5031, (V) 356-5031.)


    19.  CENTRAL INFORMATION FAClLlTY (CIF) IMPLEMENTED AT DDN PMO

The DDN PMO has implemented a centralized collection of locally
maintained data files for the purpose of providing information reports
to the DDN PMO Management Staff.  Currently 19 files of information are
available for use in the generation of management reports and responses
to AD HOC queries.  At the present time, usage of the CIF is limited to
internal DDN PMO staff and is not accessible to the network community of
users.  However, the majority of the CIF data will eventually be available
through the work being accomplished by the Network Information System
(NIS) Activity at the Defense Communications Engineering Center (DCEC)
at Reston, Virginia. (Ms. Betty Windham, B628, (703) 285-5219, (V) 356-5219.)

	21.  INTER-SERVICE/AGENCY AUTOMATED MESSAGE PROCESSING EXCHANGE
			 (I-S/A AMPE)

The I-S/A AMPE program will field 100 I-S/A AMPE systems to standardize
the current service/Agency AMPEs such as the LDMX, AMME, AFAMPE and
Streamliner, and, combined with the Defense Data Network (DDN), replace
the AUTODIN Switching Centers (ASCs).  I-S/A AMPE will provide a
multi-level secure, DDN host which can provide the same capabilities as
today's systems; modernize the standard DoD Formal Message Service; and,
in addition, extend automated communications to the user.  Program goals
include DSSCS/GENSER consolidation and user DDN as a subscriber
transmission media.

The I-S/A AMPE is an element of the Integrated AUTODIN System
Architecture (IASA), an architecture defining DoD data communications
into the 1990's.  The IASA includes the Defense Data Network - the
transmission media; BLACKER - a host-to-host security device to encrypt
messages which leaves the address intact for message routing; the I-S/A
AMPE; and the DoD AUTODIN Subscriber Terminals - a program to
consolidate multi-service terminal procurements where requirements
intersect.

Fielding the I-S/A AMPE will increase the survivability of the formal
message network by increasing the number and dispersal of switching
nodes.  The program is further designed to eliminate the duplication of
effort associated with separate development and procurement of different
Service and Agency AMPE systems.  I-S/A AMPE will be responsive to the
message traffic requirements of the National Command Authorities, the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, Unified/Specified Commands, the Military
Departments, and to the DoD and US Government Agencies during peace and
war.

The AUTODIN Switching Centers (ASCs) have provided reliable, highspeed,
and secure record communications for the DoD since the early 1960's, far
outliving their 10-year life expectancy.  However, aging equipment and new
user requirements for even higher rates of speed have resulted in
maintainability and connectivity problems and have necessitated a $50
millon dollar upgrade program to keep the ASCs viable until they are
replaced by I-S/A AMPEs.  Additionally, the survivability of AUTODIN's 15
node network in a hostile or wartime environment is highly improbable.
The existing Service and Agency AMPEs, installed in the early seventies, 
are to be replaced by the standardized I-S/A AMPE.

The I-S/A AMPE Program has a proposed baseline system topology of one
hundred (100) systems: 94 to be operationally fielded, two to be located
at the System Support Facility at Gunter AFS, AL, and four to be
located at Keesler AFB, MS, for training.  Being modular in nature,
the I-S/A AMPE will have the capability to adapt to subscriber
connectivity and throughput sizing.  It will accommodate a minimum number
of thirty-two (32) full duplex subscriber terminations and expand to a
maximum number of one hundred and twenty-eight (128); and will have the
capability to process traffic at the sustained rate of 4O to 120
lineblocks per second.

A minimum system baseline topology, which will meet operational
requirements and is supportable by the Services and concerned Defense
Agencies is expected to be validated by JCS this summer.  Until full
DSSCS/GENSER consolidation is achieved, some locations will have more
than one I-S/A AMPE system.  The following listing contains candidate
operational I-S/A AMPE locations:
