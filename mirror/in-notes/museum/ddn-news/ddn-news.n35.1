             Topic:  TAC Login Operational January 17, 1984
                        with Universal Password

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Beginning January 17, 1984, users will be required to login to  MILNET
TACs.  This will  be a  preliminary operation  on all  MILNET TACs  to
familiarize users with the  TAC login procedure, and to alert users to
the approach  of  the  fully operational  TAC  Access  Control  System
(TACACS) which begins at noon EST on February 15, 1984.

A universal User ID and Access Code  will be made available to all TAC
users for  one month  from January  17 until  February 15,  1984.   On
February 15  the universal  User ID and Access Code  will no longer be
useable.  Users will then need to  have their own  User ID and  Access
Code.  These will be printed on the TAC Access Cards being sent by the
Network Information Center  (NIC) to  authorized MILNET  TAC users  on
February 1, 1984.

During the familiarization period, the TAC will display the  universal
User ID and Access Code when a user dials up or connects via a  direct
line to a MILNET TAC.  When the user attempts to open a connection  to
a host, the TAC will prompt for a User ID.  The user must respond with
the universal User ID.  The TAC  will then prompt for an Access  Code.
The user must respond with the universal access code.  When the ID and
Access Code are correctly  entered, the TAC will  connect the user  to
the requested host.

IMPORTANT DATES

   17 Jan 84  TAC login is operational with universal User ID
    1 Feb 84  TAC Access cards will be mailed by the NIC to authorized
              TAC users
   10 Feb 84  TAC users should have received TACAC cards
   15 Feb 84  TACACS is fully operational; universal ID now void

USER GUIDELINES

If you have not yet registered as a  MILNET TAC user or if you do  not
know whether you are registered,  CHECK WITH YOUR  HOST ADMINISTRATOR.
The NIC cannot register  you as a  MILNET TAC user  or  issue a TACACS
card without authorization from your Host Administrator.

The name of the Host Administrator for your host is available via  NIC
QUERY.  To use NIC QUERY, open a connection from your host via  telnet
to SRI-NIC, or from  any TAC to the address  26.0.0.73.  At the prompt
(@), enter the command  "NIC".  This system is very user-friendly  and
you should easily find  the information you need.  You do not need  to
log in in order to  use NIC QUERY.  The  same information may also  be
FTPed as <NETINFO>HOST-ADMINISTRATORS.TXT from SRI-NIC, using username
'anonymous' and password 'guest'.   This will give you the entire list 
of Administrators for all hosts.

A limited number of temporary Guest cards will be available during the
start-up period for  distribution by each  Host Administrator.   These
cards have a limited lifetime and  are not for permanent use.  If  you
have not  received your individual  TAC access card  by  February  15,
contact your  Host  Administrator to  obtain  one of  these  temporary
cards.

HOST ADMINISTRATOR GUIDELINES

All MILNET TAC users must have  an individual User ID and Access  Code
before February 15, 1984 or they will  be unable to login to a  MILNET
TAC.  TAC Access cards are issued by the NIC; however, the NIC  cannot
issue  a TACACS card without authorization from a  Host Administrator.
If you have MILNET TAC users who are not registered,  please  register
them as soon as possible.

Guest TACACS cards  will be  mailed soon to  each Host  Administrator.
These can  be assigned  on a  temporary basis  until a  user is  fully
registered.

----------   
Problems or questions should be directed to REGISTRAR@SRI-NIC or  call
(415) 859-3695.  (800 service to  the NIC is not currently  available,
but will be implemented  in the near future.   This will be  announced
when it is available.)
