DDN Newsletter Special Issue 37				  1 Dec 1984		




                               FOREWORD


This is the second  DDN Newsletter since I assumed the duties of Program
Manager.   During  the last three months  I have had the opportunity  of
speaking  with many of you,  and I have found you to be enthusiastically
pursuing  our common  goals.   This quarter  I want  to  emphasize  four
significant achievements for which we can jointly be proud.

First, we have provided service to the first three IGNET host computers,
thus initiating  service to  the  first new  major Army  system.   This,
coupled with continuing host cutovers in the Navy NARDAC in New Orleans,
Norfolk, and Jacksonville, Fl.  and the soon to  be provided support  to
the  Air  Force's  APDS  II  and  European  Distribution  System,   will
significantly widen the MILNET family of subscriber systems.

Second,  the physical separation of the MILNET from the ARPANET has been
completed  forming  an operational  network  to support the needs of the
unclassified military subscriber community.  This action took nearly two
years to complete,  and the final separation  went so smoothly that few,
if any, network users noticed the event.

Third,  in an effort  to improve  the availability of DDN compatible host
interface  products    from commercial vendors, the DDN PMO has
awarded five host interface contracts.  Each contract is for delivery of
a host interface  for qualification  on DDN.   In addition,  three  more
contracts are pending.

Finally,  from the comments  and concerns  I have heard  in the last
three months, it is clear to me that as far as interfaces to the network
are concerned,  DDN Standard  X.25 is needed as early as DDN can provide
it.   Our contractor,  Bolt Beranek and Newman, Inc. (BBN), has reviewed
their schedule  for DDN Standard  X.25 and has agreed  to  speed up  the
scheduled  release  of the interface  from December  1985, as originally
scheduled, to a revised date for release into the network of May 1985.

                          DDN USER ASSISTANCE
			  -------------------


DCA has established an  800 toll-free service  for DDN user  assistance.
The service is provided by the NIC under contract to the DDN PMO.  Users
who experience  problems with  using the  network in  general, and  with
Terminal-to-TAC use in particular,  are encouraged to  make use of  this
service.  User assistance is available Monday through Friday, 8 am - 5 pm
Pacific time.  The number is 1-800-235-3155.  Users who experience
network problems outside these hours should call the Network Monitoring
Center, Cambridge, Massachusetts, (617) 661-0100.  (Mr. Jack Snively,
B646, (703) 285-5227, (V) 356-5227)

                             PHYSICAL SPLIT
			     --------------

The physical split of the MILNET  and ARPANET was completed 6  September
84 with  the  disconnection  of the  last  inter-switch  trunk  directly
connecting IMPs on  the two  networks, and full  activation of  separate
network monitoring centers for each network.

This event  concludes  a two  year  planning and  implementation  effort
creating the DDN unclassified  segment, MILNET, for  DoD long haul  data
communications users.  The ARPANET continues  to be operated by DCA  for
DARPA-sponsored data  communications  network research  and  development
projects.  (Maj. Bruce Sweeny, B647, (703) 285-5007, (V) 356-5007)


                             MILNET EUROPE
			     -------------	

Implementation  difficulties  have  caused  slippages  in  the  European
network expansion schedule.   The overall expansion  plan will begin  to
show progress in  second quarter FY85.   However, extensive efforts  are
under way to achieve a MILNET/MINET merge prior to the end of 1984.  (Mr.
Darryl Henry, B627, (703)285-5038 (V) 356-5038)


                             MILNET PACIFIC
			     --------------

The planned topology of the Pacific portion of the MILNET has  undergone
some revision in  recent months.   Wahiawa, Hawaii,  is currently  under
review and may not  become a MILNET node  site.  The Navy has  requested
that NAVDAF, Pearl Harbor, be considered instead of the DSCS station  at
Wahiawa; however, the  DDN PMO intends  to ask the  Navy to review  this
decision.  Since some of  the DSCS channels  proposed are not  currently
available, it is  expected that  DCTN and  commercial satellite  service
will be  used to  augment the  available  DSCS.  This  may result  in  a
revised topology.   (Mr.  Dennis  Morris.   B627,  (703)  285-5021,  (V)
356-5021)

                         MILNET ACCESS CONTROL
			 ---------------------

The final Honeywell H316 TAC on the MILNET has been replaced with a C/30
TAC, making  TACACS fully  operational throughout  the MILNET.   Several
efforts are underway with the goal of strengthening the system.   TACACS
Phase II, when implemented, will greatly enhance the level of protection
by  providing  real-time  reporting  of  a  wide  variety  of  intrusion
attempts.  Implementation of mail-bridge filters to prevent uncontrolled
access from ARPANET TACs into the MILNET will be the next major step  in
Access Control.   An  announcement  on this  step  will  be  forthcoming
shortly.  (Maj. Glynn Parker, (703) 285-5133, (V) 356-5133)

The MINET Stage II task order was executed on 27 April 1984.  The Naples
and Sigonella nodes were installed in July.  The Capodichino  electronic
mail host  and  the satellite  circuit  from Vaihingen  to  Naples  were
operational in October.  Terminal  installations in Italy are  scheduled
for completion by  December.  Installations  in Spain  are scheduled  to
start in January 1985 and to be completed in February.

Preparations are now underway to transition the MINET system into an
operational MILNET effort in December 1984.

Port allocation and management, processing requests for termination on a
DDN TAC, validation of existing full period service, planned common-user

Further, implementation of these procedures will eliminate the need  for
the quarterly inventory  report previously  submitted by  the Node  Site
Coordinators.  (Mr. Jack Snively, B646, (703) 285-5227, (V) 356-5227)

    DRAFT DCA INSTRUCTION FOR MANAGEMENT OF DDN INSTALLATION ACTIONS
    ----------------------------------------------------------------

Draft DCAI 310-P70-XX, 31 May 1984 has been forwarded to DCA PAC and DCA
EUR for comments.  The new  DCAI describes detailed procedures and  flow
of  DCA  actions   on  new  node   site  installations  and   subscriber
connections.  (Maj. Bruce Sweeny, B647, (703) 285-5007), (V) 356-5007)


              DDN NODE INSTALLATION/RELOCATION LEAD TIMES
	      -------------------------------------------

Installation of new nodes and relocation of existing nodes require the
same set of functions and similar lead times to execute.  These are:

a. Nomination of new site to DCA via the Service's DDN coordinating
   office with completed presurvey form.  (T=0)

b. DCA and service E&I agency conduct a joint site survey at the
   nominated site.  (T=30-60 days)

c. DCA orders interswitch trunks and remote access lines, plus needed
   node equipment (T=60-90 days).  For relocations some circuits may be
   rehomes of existing lines; this must be determined by negotiations
   between DCA and the applicable circuit provider (TELCO Service) on
   a case-by-case basis.

d. Circuits are installed/tested or rehomed and tested, and the service
   engineers prepare the new site.  (T=90 days (Conus)-540 days (Oconus))

e. DCA provides for delivery of new node equipment or deinstallation
   and reinstallation of relocated node equipment.  (T depends on
   successful circuit activations.)  For relocations, the site is	
   expected to provide for transportation of node equipment between
   old and new sites, unless other arrangment are negotiated with DCA.
			
f. New node testing and cutover.  This is done at the time of the node
   equipment installation.  (T depends principally on trunk circuit
   lead times but estimate T=180-540 days.)

                   ARPANET TAC ACCESS CONTROL SYSTEM
		   ---------------------------------

Over the  next several  months,  a system  will  be put  into  operation
designed to authenticate each  user who attempts  to access the  ARPANET
via a Terminal Access Controller (TAC).  This is a separate system  from
the MILNET TACACS already in use to control access to DDN through MILNET
TACS.  The  new ARPANET  access  system will  affect only  ARPANET  TACS
(which currently  have no  access control)  and the  UCL-TAC in  London.
Details of this new ARPANET TACACS system will be announced in a  future
DDN Management Bulletin.

The MILNET and ARPANET access  control systems have a similar  function,
namely to restrict DDN access via TACs to authorized users, but they are
implemented differently.  In the  current MILNET TACACS,  identification
of authorized  users is  provided by  the Host  Administrators, and  all
users must be registered and given TAC access cards by the NIC.  In  the
new ARPANET system, a capability  for registering authorized users  will
be provided to a "responsible person" in each government and  contractor
organization whose members need to use ARPANET TACs.


Information about authorized users will be  kept in a user database.   A
"user database tool" has been developed which the responsible persons in
various organizations will  use to add,  delete, and change  identifying
information on authorized TAC  users.  The database  tool resides on  an
ARPANET host and can be accessed by authorized persons over the network.

Periodically, the user database information  will be sent in a  compiled
form to each of several "login hosts" on the ARPANET.  When a user on  a
TAC port tries to open  a connection, he or she  will be prompted for  a
name and password.   The TAC will  then interact with  one of the  login
hosts to validate the given name and password.  Each TAC will contain  a
list of all login hosts and, if one is down, the TAC will  automatically
try another.  If  the name/password  pair is invalid,  according to  the
login host, the TAC will  give the user an  error message and refuse  to
open the connection.   Thus, access will  be limited to  users who  have
been entered into the user database by the responsible person for  their
organization.

In addition to  information about  authorized users,  the user  database
also contains records  identifying organizations  and their  responsible
persons.  The organizations  are arranged in  a hierarchical  structure,
with DCA, due to  its responsibility for  operational management of  the
ARPANET, as  the  root organization  at  level zero.   DARPA  and  other
government organizations will be  at level one  and will be  responsible
for creating the next level.  For example, IPTO will be an  organization
at level two (below DARPA).  Below IPTO will be contractor organizations
whose members  need  ARPANET access  to  support efforts  performed  for


DDN Newsletter Special Issue 37		                     1 Dec 1984



DARPA/IPTO.  In each case, both  user and organization records can  only
be created below a given organization by someone authorized to "act  as"
the  organization.   The  responsible  person  can  always  act  as  the
organization.  Thus, the responsible person can assign a subordinate the
job of actually manipulating the user database tool.

The process  is  now underway  of  identifying responsible  persons  for
organizations which use ARPANET, and  sending them documentation on  the
user database  tool.   Soon  after  receiving  this  documentation,  the
responsible persons will begin entering  authorized users into the  user
database.  If  you are  an ARPANET  TAC user,  you should  expect to  be
contacted by someone in your  organization with a username and  password
prior to full activation of the  access control system.  A trial  period
will begin shortly,  during which  access control will  operate using  a
standard username and password announced in the TAC herald.  Before  the
end of this trial  period, adequate notice will  be given in the  herald
that individual passwords will soon be required.  This will give  users,
who have not been contacted, time  to track down the responsible  person
at their  organization to  obtain a  username and  password.  (Mr.  Jack
Snively, B646, (703) 285-5320, (V) 356-5230)

                           AIR FORCE DDN PMO
			   -----------------

The Air Force has  established an Air  Force DDN Implementation  Office,
which  will  coordinate  all  AF  DDN  activities  including  subscriber
connections and node site support.  This office is the Automated Systems
Program Office (ASPO) and is headed  up by Maj. Larry Angell.  The  ASPO
operates from Gunter AFS, Alabama.  Contact can be made by U.S. mail  to
ASPO/PGD, Gunter  AFS, AL,  36114-6340; by  AUTODIN to  ASPO Gunter  AFS
AL//PGD//; by  DDN  to  AFDDN@Gunter-Adam; and  by  telephone  to  (205)
279-3531, (V) 446-3261.

DDN is  particularly  pleased  to  have  this  full-bodied  support  and
anticipates that future support for the Air Force subscribers will be of
the highest calibre.  The ASPO has a wide range of planning guides  such
as Facility Support Plan (FSP), Installation/Implementation Plan (I/IP),
and Program  Management  Plan  (PMP), among  others.   These  plans  are
available upon request through the  ASPO. (Maj. Mike Allen, B616,  (703)

The DDN PMO held the  third DDN Telecommunications Certification  Office
(TCO) working  group conference  during the  period of  18-21  September
1984.  This year's conference  was held at  DIRUSARCCO at Ft.  Huachuca,
AZ.  The purpose  of the conference  was to discuss  DDN procedures  for
requesting service and other items pertaining to the DDN program as they
relate to TCO responsibilities.  Some of the items discussed were:

                        SUPPORT CONCEPT ANALYSIS
                        ------------------------

Dynamics Research Corporation of Wilmington, MA, has been tasked by  the
DDN PMO to do  a comparative logistic support  concept analysis for  the
DDN.  The analysis  will be used  in the formulation  of a DDN  Logistic
Support Concept Recommendation to  the DDN coordinating committee.   The
analysis will  investigate  four methods  or  options for  DDN  logistic
support:


   - Sole source contractor support
   - Competitively procured contractor support
   - Organic on-site and contractor off-site support
   - On- and off-site organic support

The  analysis   will  also   take  into   consideration  subjective   or
non-quantifiable factors other  than cost.  Work  on the analysis  began
the week of  24 September 1984  and the final  report will be  delivered
ninety days  after receipt  of the  task order.   (Jimmy Connell,  B635,
(703) 285-5237, (V) 356-5237)


                 INTERNET PRIVATE LINE INTERFACE (IPLI)
                 --------------------------------------

A contract modification for the IPLI has been developed and negotiated
with the contractor.  The modification includes NSA's IPLI prototype
development security requirements, HEMP protection development, addition
of the external gateway protocol, narrative clarifications, and
extension of the contract through 31 March 1985.  The IPLI is presently
undergoing software unit and some system testing and hardware validation
testing.  (Robert Olson, B626, (703) 285-5449, (V) 356-5449)


               NETWORK ACCESS COMPONENT (NAC) ACQUISITION
	       ------------------------------------------	 

The "Request for Proposals" (RFP) on the NAC was issued in July 1984  by
DECCO.  Over 90 RFP  copies were requested.  The  responses were due  18
September 1984.  The nominees for the evaluation panel were submitted by
the Army,  Navy, and  Air Force.   The evaluation  panel convened  on  1
October 1984.  It is anticipated that the contract will be signed during
the first  quarter  FY85.  Delivery  of  the first  production  NACs  is
expected in the second  quarter FY86, with a  delivery rate of 25  units
per month during the life of the contract.  (Ronald Hyrkas, B626,  (703)
