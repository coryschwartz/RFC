                       ARPANET NEWSLETTER

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Gentlemen/Ladies:

     Enclosed is an announcement of a seminar to discuss the 
implementation of the new DOD Standard Protocols.  Since these protocols
will replace the existing NCP on the ARPANET in the next two years, this
seminar is of importance to those personnel at ARPANET hosts who will be
concerned with implementing the DOD standard Protocols.  For those who 
can attend this seminar, it should be highly educational and 
informative.  We also wish to note that you or your organization will 
have to defray any travel and conference costs involved with your 
attendance.  This seminar will go into much greater detail on the higher
level protocols then we hope to cover in the proposed liaison meetings 
(See recent DCA Newsletter).  In addition, due to funding and scheduling
problems, the liaison meeting schedule presented in the newsletter is 
under revision.  We will make distirbution of a finalized schedule as 
soon as we can firm it up.

Regards,
Joe Haughney  Major USAF

  IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INTERNET AND TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOLS

   SEMINAR ON THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
   DATA COMMUNICATIONS HOST-TO-HOST
   PROTOCOL STANDARDS

---------------------------------------------------------------------

TIME: November 24-25, 1980

LOCATION: National Bureau of Standards
          Gaithersburg, Maryland

SPONSORED BY: U. S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE

   Defense Communications Agency
   Defense Communications Engineering Center
   Computer Systems Division

   Office of the Secretary of Defense
   Under Secretary of Defense for
   Research and Engineering
   Information Systems Directorate

   Defense Advanced Research
   Projects Agency
   Information Processing Techniques Office

------------------------------------------------------------------------

OBJECTIVE OF THE SEMINAR

     The objective of this seminar is to assist personnel who will 
implement the Department of Defense (DoD) Standard Host-to-Host Data 
Communications Protocols.  The seminar will also provide information of 
interest to protocol designers, computer vendors, and others who are 
active in the field.  This two-day seminar will present the technical 
experience gained from DoD research and the corresponding implementation
efforts related to two specific protocols, the DoD Standard Transmission
Control Protocol (TCP), and the DoD Standard Internet Protocol (IP).

     The sessions will concentrate on the TCP and IP specifications (1, 
2), and the implementation of these protocols on different operating 
systems.  On the first day, the seminar will present the motivation for 
the DoD Standardization effort, and will describe the approach for 
managing this effort.  The design concepts and models for TCP and IP 
will be discussed in detail. On the second day, the seminar will address
issues resulting from implementation of TCP and IP on different computer
host and operating systems.  Audience participation and interaction will
be encouraged.

ABOUT THE DOD DATA COMMUNICATIONS STANDARDIZATION EFFORT

     The Department of Defense (DoD) Data Communications Standardization
Effort was formally initiated in 1978 by the Assistant Secretary of 
Defense for Communications, Command and Control and Intelligence 
(ASD(C3I)) when he directed the adoption of a set of DoD Standard 
host-to-host protocols based on protocols developed by the Defense 
Advanced Research Projects Agency.  These protocols are the DoD Standard
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP).  The
Office of ASD(C3I) requested and received from DCA a plan for performing
the function of Executive Agent for DoD Data communications protocol 
Standardization.

     The Defense Communications Engineering Center of the Defense 
Communications Agency and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency 
have active programs to provide standard protocols for current and 
future DoD data communications systems.  The protocol standardization 
initiative is intended to reduce costs, increase interoperability, and 
facilitate the extendibility of systems.  The goal is to develop 
standard protocols that ensure that DoD interoperability, survivability,
robustness, security, precedence, and compartmentation requirements are 
supported.  Furthermore, part of this goal is the proper coordination of
DoD requirements to ensure that the appropriate services are considered 
by the pertinent standardization forums, and to ensure that DoD 
host-to-host standard protocols are responsive to emerging federal, 
national, and international standards.

     This seminar will provide a vehicle to distribute documentation and
convey knowledge essential for developing expertise within industry and 
educational institutions that support current and efficient 
implementation of DoD communications systems.  Future seminars will be 
planned to provide a forum for exchange of information and ideas.
