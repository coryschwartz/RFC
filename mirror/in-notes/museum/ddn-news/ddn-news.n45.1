			MILNET TAC MANAGEMENT
			---------------------

DDN News 40, 1 Jul 85 stated that:

"DDN Management Bulletin 26, 30 Jan 85 and DCA AUTODIN message 211531Z
Nov 84 (with amendments) advised that the Defense Data Network Program
Management Office (DDN PMO) would be establishing configuration
management for the DDN Terminal Access Controllers (TACs) for a number
of reasons: to provide centralized TAC port allocation, to validate
those connections to TAC ports that were authorized and operational,
and to identify those connections requiring transfer of billing from the
current organization to DDN.  Supporting commands of the TACs were
requested to submit Request for Service (RFS)/Feeder Telecommunications
Service Request (TSR) to justify and validate the current port
connections.  This was to be accomplished by 1 May 85.  The DDN PMO
also advised that any connections not validated would be disabled
effective 15 May 85.  (Quite frankly, the response to validate the
connections has been less than favorable.)"

Effective 21 Apr 86, the DDN TAC AUDIT will begin again and all TAC port
connections that have not been validated by an RFC/Feeder TSR will be
disabled.  Approximately 10 TACs per month will be selected for this
action, until all the TACs have been covered.

The Defense Communications System (DCS) Data Systems Directorate
(DCA/B600) will accept requests to stay a port disablement for 60 days
to allow for submission of the appropriate RFS/Feeder TSR.

To verify if a port connection has been validated, call John Saunders,
(703) 352-9700.  Effective 21 Apr 86, problems associated with
the TAC connection should be referred to LTJG Carey DCA/B652,
(703) 285-5132 (V) 356-5132 or MILNETMGR DCA/B652 at (703) 285-5230,
(V) 356-5230.
