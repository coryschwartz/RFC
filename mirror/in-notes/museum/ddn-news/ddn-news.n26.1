ARPANET/MILNET SPLIT - HOW IT WILL HAPPEN.

Restructuring the ARPANET into  two networks, an experimental  network
(ARPANET)  and  an  operational  network  (MILNET),  began  with   the
establishment of the MILNET  on 4 April 1983.  This Newsletter is  the
first of a series of newsletters which will describe the  evolutionary
process which will be  used to accomplish the split.  While it is  the
intent of the DDN-PMO to minimize any user impact, some effects cannot
be avoided.  These newsletters are intended to keep users informed  so
that they can better participate in split activities and plan for  any
impacts.

This introductory article will briefly address major milestones in the
split, and describe the two  nets after the split.  Future newsletters
will elaborate on these and related issues.


   1. Major Milestones.

Four dates stand  out above  others as  significant in  the effort  to
divide the ARPANET: 4 April 1983, 4 October 1983, 1 December 1983  and
the first quarter of CY 1984.

On 4  April 1983,  the MILNET  was established  and CSIF  billing  for
ARPANET service discontinued for those  DoD nodes and TACs  designated
to become part of the Defense Data Network - Unclassified Segment, the
MILNET.  With this  action,  the DDN  (MILNET)  came  officially  into
existence, and the evolutionary  process of partitioning the  existing
shared backbone into the MILNET  and the ARPANET Experimental  Network
began. A  complete  list  of  MILNET and  ARPANET  facilities  may  be
obtained from  the  Network Information  Center  (NIC) from  the  file
[SRI-NIC] <NETINFO>MILNET-ARPANET.LIST .

On 4  October  1983,  the  MILNET and  ARPANET  will  become  separate
networks.  This initial partitioning will be implemented by exercising
software in each IMP which enforces the segregation of hosts and  TACs
into  separate  communities  of  interest.   Electronic  mail  service
between ARPANET  and  MILNET  will  be provided  for  all  users,  and
approved hosts will  be authorized additional  services, i.e.,  telnet
and  FTP,  where   required,  via  devices   known  as   mail-bridges.
Implementation of  this  software  segregation  of  the  networks,  or
software split, will require each host to update its tables to reflect
correct network numbers.   The ARPANET  hosts will remain  in Net  10,
while the MILNET hosts will change to Net 26.  Future newsletters will
address these, and  other issues  pertinent to the  software split  in
depth.

1 December 1983 is  the target date  for Phase One  of the TAC  Access
Control System (TACACS).  TACACS will be installed on the MILNET only.
Software development for Phase One  is nearing completion by BBN,  and
the major  effort  remaining  is  user  registration,  which  will  be
accomplished during  the coming  months  by SRI  International  (SRI).
This undertaking is being accomplished by expanding the existing WHOIS
database to become the official register of authorized network  users,
with a subset being the register of authorized MILNET TAC users.   SRI
will be working very closely  with Host Administrators at each  MILNET
site during the registration and  beyond.  Your cooperation and  input
to SRI requests for information is officially solicited.  TACACS  will
be the subject of a future Newsletter.

The first  quarter, CY  1984, has  been established  as the  goal  for
completion of  the  circuit reconfiguration  necessary  to  physically
divide the two networks.  The date for this milestone is somewhat soft
since it  depends upon  successful  completion of  a large  number  of
circuit orders, many of which involve  long lead times.  When the date
for this milestone  is more  precisely known, it  will be  publicized.
Because of the software split occurring in October 1983, however,  the
physical partitioning should be transparent to the user community.



   2. Communities of Interest.

Three distinct  communities of  interest  have been  identified  among
users presently on the ARPANET;  these are the ARPANET Community,  the
Military Open Community, and the  Military Closed Community.  Each  of
these have  their own  purposes to  fulfill and  requirements which  a
network must serve.  The term Military, in this context, is not to  be
understood as  exclusively  DoD,  but  as  referring  to  its  primary
make-up.  It  may also  include  contractors and  other  organizations
which  support  DoD  programs,  as  well  as  the  non-DoD  Government
agencies.

The ARPANET Community consists of hosts and users who participate with
DARPA in  network  and  internetwork  experimentation.  Communications
reliability, although important, is  secondary to research needs.  For
example, among network experiments currently projected by DARPA, it is
planned to segment the network in order to further explore the use  of
packet radio  techniques  for  network  reconstitution.  Although  the
disruption caused  by  such experiments  is  hardly affordable  in  an
operational environment, it  is an  acceptable price to  pay within  a
community where research is the prime reason for existence.

The Military  Open  Community consists  of  hosts and  users  who,  to
satisfy their  assigned  mission,  require  continued  access  to  the
ARPANET community, but whose  mission is primarily operational  rather
than experimental in  nature.  Because of  their mission  orientation,
the users in this community would find the disruptions associated with
the  experimental  environment   of  the  ARPANET   community  to   be
unacceptable.  A large portion of this community are themselves in the
Research and  Development  business,  but do  not  meet  the  specific
criteria of  participating  with  or in  coordination  with  DARPA  in
network or internetwork experimentation.

The smallest  of  the three  communities  using the  existing  ARPANET
consists of military  hosts and users  who communicate primarily  with
their own  interest  group,  and have  no  requirement  for  continued
communication with the  ARPANET community.  Although currently  small,
projections of new users who will require service in the coming  years
indicate this to  be a strong growth area.  Examples  of new users  in
this group include personnel centers, finance centers, and  comparable
organizations for whom general access clearly is not advised.

     3. Network Architecture.

        (a) Three Communities on Two Backbones.

With the communities of interest clearly identified, the task  becomes
how to partition  the network  to meet the  needs of  all, with  least
disruption in the process, and at the least cost.  The approach chosen
is a  physically separated,  dual-backbone design  with both  military
communities on one backbone, and  the ARPANET community on the  other.
Once separated, the backbones will  be connected by mail-bridges  (see
below) in order  to maintain  communications between  the MILNET  Open
Community and the ARPANET community.  Within the MILNET, the Open  and
Closed communities will be separated by  the continued use of the  IMP
software used for the initial  ARPANET/MILNET split in October.   Mail
Relays (see below) which  will only be  capable of passing  electronic
mail will be the only interconnections provided.  A schematic  drawing
of this topology is shown below.  Future newsletters will elaborate on
various features of the topology.

         (2) Equipment and Systems.

MAILBRIDGE

The mail-bridge connects  the MILNET and  ARPANET backbones.   Bridges
are being  installed and  will be  operational prior  to the  software
split in October.  The  mail-bridge provides electronic mail  services
for all users between  the two nets and,  on a controlled basis,  full
gateway service for MILNET hosts  who request it.  A future newsletter
will describe the procedure for obtaining this service.


MAIL-RELAY

The Mail Relay is functionally similar  to the mail-bridge in that  it
passes electronic  mail;  it  is  dissimilar  in  that,  as  presently
designed, it is incapable of passing  anything else.  One or more mail
relays will  be placed  between the  Military Open  Community and  the
Military Closed Community  to provide mail  service.  The relay(s) are
not expected to be operational prior to the physical split in 1984.


ELECTRONIC MAIL SERVICE

In order to ease the process of relocating mail accounts, the DDN will
provide a  limited  number  of  mail  accounts.   Priority  for  these
accounts will be given to MILNET  users whose present accounts are  on
hosts which have been aligned to the ARPANET, leaving the user without
a usable account.  Such users should exhaust other means of  obtaining
mail service before requesting service through the DDN PMO.
