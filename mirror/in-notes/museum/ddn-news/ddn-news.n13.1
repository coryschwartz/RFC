=====================================================================

             TOPICS:  - TIP Inventory Reports Needed ASAP
                      - NIC Host Name Servers are now up
                      - Call for Papers ACM SIGCOMM '83

---------------------------------------------------------------------

TIP/TAC INVENTORY REPORTS ARE NEEDED NOW, PLEASE

There are a number of TIP/TAC inventory reports which are overdue.  
Those TIP/TAC Liaison who have not yet submitted their input should do 
so immediately.

   ===> NOTE:  Send reports online to TACSTATRPT@BBNB  <===

               Do NOT send them to the NIC

The new procedures for submitting TIP/TAC Inventory Reports was outlined
in ANEWS-11 for those of you that are new or missed reading it.


NIC HOST NAME SERVERS AND TCP/IP NOW AVAILABLE

TCP/IP is now supported by the SRI-NIC AUGUST(TENEX) monitor, and TCP 
Telnet can be used to access NIC services online.

The first version of the DoD internet Hostnames Service is now available
from the ARPANET/DDN Network Information Center machine, SRI-NIC, via 
NCP, TCP, or UDP.  The NCP and TCP versions meet or exceed the 
specifications outlined in RFC 810 and 811 (cpu type has been added).  
The UDP version meets the basic IEN 116 specification, and is a simple 
binary query/response name/address service. 

We request (with some trepidation) that you try the servers and send 
additional information and feedback to NIC@NIC.  The NIC will maintain 
the old-format (Host#/IMP#) host table for a period of 2 months.  The 
old table now has the pathname [SRI-NIC]<NETINFO>OHOSTS.TXT.  The 
new-format table is in the file [SRI-NIC]<NETINFO>HOSTS.TXT and also in 
<NETINFO>NHOSTS.TXT.  We continue to depend on all of you to provide the
NIC with information on ARPANET/DDN hosts and other pertinent hosts, 
nets, and gateways,  while work progresses toward development of name 
domains.

The SRI staff involved were: Ken Harrenstien - protocols, servers, and 
UDP; Mary Dyer - host table; Henry Miller - TCP/IP;  Geoff Goodfellow, 
Jim Mathis, Holly Nelson, Zaw-Sing Su, and Bill Westfield also 
contributed.

This work was funded by DCA and was a joint effort of the SRI Network 
Information Center (NIC), the DARPA Internet Working Group, the Network 
Liaison, the BBN Network Operations Center (NCC), and the Defense 
Communications Engineering Center (DCEC).  Jon Postel of USC-ISI, Deputy
Director of the DARPA Internet User's Group and Internet Configuration 
Control Board, consulted with the NIC on the protocols and helped edit 
the gateway and network names and numbers.  ISI, DCEC, and BBN helped 
with TCP/IP testing.  The Network Liaison provided the host information,
as did many others representing 'foreign' nets.  Thanks to all.
  

ACM SIGCOMM '83 SYMPOSIUM ON COMMUNICATIONS ARCHITECTURES AND PROTOCOLS

Dr. Vint Cerf from DARPA would like to call to your attention the Call

Architectures and Protocols.  The symposium will cover such topics as: 
network and communications software applications; new architectures; 
protocols and network algorithms; standards; techniques for design, 
testing, validation and performance evaluation; models for verification 
and specification; and distributed systems for message-switched 
networks.
