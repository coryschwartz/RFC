         DEFENSE DATA NETWORK (DDN) QUALIFIED HOST INTERFACES
         ----------------------------------------------------

DDN link and network qualification test information source for 1822/HDH,
X.25 Basic, and X.25 Standard protocols is DCA circular "DDN Host
Interface Qualification Testing - Link and Network Layers" (DCAC
370-P195-X (DRAFT)).

The following list contains interfaces which have successfully passed the
link and network Qualification Tests required prior to permitting a host
to connect to the DDN.  This list is current as of 24 Oct 86 and
supersedes all previous lists.  Interfaces qualified for X.25 Standard
are also qualified for basic operation.  Interfaces are qualified for
operation at or below the specified baud rate.  Operation above the
specified baud rate is undetermined.  This list is not intended to be a
qualified products list.  This list identifies interface equipment which
has successfully passed the testing outlined in the circular in para #1
above.  No restriction in the selection of equipment is intended.  Other
equipment, while not currently qualified for DDN use, can be qualified at
a later date.  However, procurement offices may make timely completion of
Qualification Testing a contract requirement.

                   ARPANET PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS
                   --------------------------------

A marked increase in ARPANET congestion was noted during September.
Based upon an evaluation of the situation, the following specific
actions were accomplished.

	- TAC 113 was installed on ARPANET TACs, reducing
          character-at-a-time traffic.

	- Network parameters were adjusted to provide more even
          sharing of cross-country bandwidth.

	- Wideband Network gateways were modified to favor the
          Wideband Net over the ARPANET for cross-country traffic
          between some LANs.

	- Additional network performance statistics were collected in
          early October (as reported earlier).

	- A link was restored between the Purdue and Wisconsin nodes.

In addition, and most significantly, a 56Kb line was put into service
last week between USC and CIT.  This line effectively bypasses a 19.2b
line that had created a bottleneck in one of the ARPANET's three
cross-country paths.

Finally, the ARPANET was upgraded to PSN 6, and Mailbridges were
upgraded to MB1008.1.

On Friday, 7 November, all of these changes were in place together for
the first time.  Performance measurement data taken on Friday and on
Monday, 10 November indicate significant improvement in three key
measures: mean round trip delay, mean number of hops taken by data
packets, and number of performance-related traps received by the
ARPANET Monitoring Center.

Mean round trip delay and mean number of hops have returned
approximately to their June 1986 levels, and are down significantly
from levels measured in early October (Mean round trip delay, in
particular, has dropped from 1215 ms on 2 October and 625 ms on 3
October to 298 ms on 7 November). "Traps" reported by network nodes to
the Monitoring Center indicating congestion and other performance
problems have decreased by more than an order of magnitude -- from
80K-150K per day in October to 5K-10K on November 7 and 10.

>From this data we can conclude that the ARPANET is past its most
immediate crisis.  However, the network has little reserve capacity,
and performance is still critical.  Some congestion still occurs, and
loss of a single trunk or node could still bring the network into a
very congested state.  Thus, further steps to improve network
performance, such as the provision of additional cross-country
bandwidth and additional processing capacity at several key nodes,
must still be taken in order to restore the ARPANET to longterm good
health.  (John Thomas, Jr/DCA/B601/285-5010, (AV) 356-5010)
