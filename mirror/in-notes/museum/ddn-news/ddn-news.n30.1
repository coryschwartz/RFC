            Topic:  TCP/IP Host Implementations - Results of
                      Testing for Upcoming Network Split

======================================================================

The following report was  prepared by BBN  after extensive testing  of
host implementations of  TCP/IP.  The manner  of testing is  described
herein.  While the results are not conclusive, they indicate that some
hosts and the users of those  hosts will be adversely affected by  the
October  4th  split  of  the  ARPANET  into  the  MILNET/ARPANET.   In
particular, hosts that  currently communicate on  a regular basis  may
find themselves in different networks  on October 4.  Thus, they  will
have to use  a gateway  to reach  each other.   If either  host has  a
faulty implementation of TCP/IP, this may be impossible.

Two things need to be stressed:

1.   Only  communication  to  or  from  a  host  with  a  bad   TCP/IP
implementation should be affected in any way.

2.  Communication through  gateways (mail bridges)  may be  impossible
for hosts with bad TCP/IP implementations.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Over the last month, several experiments were run at BBN to  determine
the correctness of ARPANET host TCP/IP implementations.  Each test was
run several times  to minimize the  probability that a  host was  down
during each test; however, it is possible that some hosts scored lower
than they deserved because they were off the network during all tests.

The first experiment was conducted  entirely within the ARPANET.   The
second  and  third  experiments,  however,  required  another  network
attached to the ARPANET by more than one gateway (since the purpose of
the experiments was to test hosts' abilities to talk through gateways;
see below).  BBN has its own ARPANET-like network called the  "BBNNET"
which is currently connected to the ARPANET by three gateways.  One of
these gateways, the BBN-GATEWAY, is known to the rest of the internet;
it is the gateway which is normally used by traffic between the BBNNET
and the ARPANET.  The combination of the ARPANET, the BBNNET, and  the
three gateways  was  used  as  the  testbed  for  these  inter-network
experiments.

There were three experiments.  The purpose of the first, Experiment A,
was to  determine which  hosts are  unable  to talk  TCP even  in  the
simplest circumstances.  From an ARPANET  host, an FTP connection  was
opened to every ARPANET host (not including TACs, gateways, or  secure
hosts).  The remote FTP server was then asked for "help", which causes
half a screen or  so of text to  be sent from the  remote host to  the
testing host.   The purpose  of  this was  simply  to cause  a  little
traffic to  flow  on the  FTP  connection.  Then  the  connection  was
closed.  This  test is  the  simplest possible  in  that it  does  not
require the hosts  to talk through  a gateway or  to use ICMP.   Hosts
which failed this test are labelled "4" in the following list.   These
hosts were excluded from other experiments.

The purpose of Experiment B was to determine which hosts are unable to
talk TCP to a host in another  network.  From a BBNNET host, the  same
FTP experiment  was  repeated.   Hosts  failing  to  sustain  the  FTP
conversation required by this test  are labelled "3" in the  following
list.  These hosts can talk to hosts in their own network, but not  to
hosts in other networks.  These hosts were excluded from Experiment C.

The purpose  of  Experiment  C  was  to  determine  which  hosts  deal
incorrectly with  redirect messages.   This experiment  was just  like
Experiment B,  with one  complication.  The  BBN gateway  was told  to
redirect all ARPANET  hosts to  another gateway,  "Bridge", that  also
connects the ARPANET  and the  BBNNET.  A program  called "HTM"  (Host
Traffic Matrix) was  run in  the Bridge during  this experiment.   HTM
records the  source  and destination  of  every datagram  that  passes
through the  gateway.   Thus,  after running  Experiment  C,  the  HTM
results in the  Bridge listed  every host that  obeyed the  redirects.
HTM was also run  in the BBN gateway  during this experiment, and  the
results were used  as further  proof that some  hosts disregarded  the
redirects altogether.  Some hosts failed this test because even though
they did not "choke" on the redirects and could carry the FTP exchange
to completion, they did not pass any traffic through the Bridge  (they
ignored the redirects).   Other hosts  failed this  test because  they
died or hung the FTP connection after receiving one or more redirects.
Hosts failing this  experiment are labelled  "2".  Hosts passing  this
experiment are labelled "1".

In summary, of 190  hosts tested, 98 scored  "1" (51%), 28 scored  "2"
(15%), 23 scored  "3" (12%),  and 41  scored "4"  (22%).  Since  these
tests were very simple  and did not exercise  all capabilities of  TCP
(for example, retransmission of lost  datagrams) these results are  in
no  way  proof  that  all   "1"  hosts  have  perfectly  correct   TCP
implementations.
