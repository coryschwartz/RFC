Gentlepeople:

Per our previous newsletter, we have enclosed a new Host/TIP Liaison 
Duties letter.  We hope that it clarifies your responsibilities better 
than the previous one.  Two items of importance to TIP Liaisons are that
the TIP Inventories will still be required for the immediate future.  
The October report for 1980 should be submitted not later than 15 
November 1980 if you have not already done so.  TIP phone numbers for 
dial in service will also be changed.  Some sites have not been doing 
this.  We will publish a schedule next month stating when sites should 
change their numbers.  Changes will start 1 January 1981.

You have all received in a previous message the list of hosts which have
not implemented 96 bit leaders.  With the changeout of IMP software on 1
January 1981 to support 96 bit leaders, hosts with 32 bit leader 
software will not be able to interact with the network.  That means no, 
repeat no, ARPANET service for such Hosts.  Liaison should inform their 
system software personnel to proceed posthaste to implement the 
necessary software, if they have not already done so.

                 ARPANET TECHNICAL LIAISON DUTIES

---------------------------------------------------------------------

The ARPANET Technical Liaison act as advisors to network users, the 
Network Information Center (NIC), the Network Control Center (NCC), and 
the Defense Communications Agency (DCA) on technical matters relating to
the ARPANET.  The liaison are the chief source of information about 
individual ARPANET hosts.  They often contribute to the design of 
network protocols and related software and make suggestions for needed 
changes and improvements through memos, RFCs (network technical notes), 
and participation in network working groups.  The liaison are a valuable
network resource and the first point of contact for most ARPANET users.

The liaison are traditionally individuals trained in computer science, 
telecommunications, or a related field, and are familiar with the 
resources available at the hosts they represent.  Each host on the 
network has no more than one technical liaison; however, the same person
may serve as liaison for more than one host.  The technical liaison are 
coordinated by the Manager of the ARPANET Network Information Center, 
currently Elizabeth Feinler (FEINLER@SRI-KL).

LIAISON DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:

1.  The primary responsibilities of the Host/TIP liaison are to help 
monitor the ARPANET against unauthorized use and to provide assistance 
and guidelines to ARPANET users.  The liaison is frequently the first 
person approached by potential ARPANET users, or the first person to 
become aware of unauthorized use of network resources.  Liaison are 
expected to adhere to the following guidelines and procedures in 
carrying out these responsibilities:

   A.  ATTACHING HOSTS OR TERMINALS TO THE ARPANET -  Permission to 
   connect hosts or terminals to the ARPANET can only be granted by a 
   sponsoring agency through DCA.  The liaison or host administrator 
   should obtain permission to occupy a host port from the ARPANET 
   sponsor of the node to which a host or terminal is to be connected.  
   The node in question may belong to a sponsor other than the one 
   sponsoring the work to be done on the host or terminal to be 
   connected.  If this is the case, approval must be obtained from the 
   controlling sponsor who will determine whether the requirement is 
   valid, the port is free, and the resources are available to support 
   the interface.  The controlling sponsor will in turn submit a request
   to initiate the connection to DCA.  Only after all of these 
   permissions are obtained may a host or terminal be added or changed 
   on an IMP or TIP.  The liaison should inform any individuals at their
   facilities who may wish to connect hosts or terminals to the ARPANET,
   of this procedure.

   B.  PROVIDING HOST INFORMATION TO THE NIC AND DCA -  Upon completion 
   of the host installation and prior to the host passing traffic, the 
   liaison must contact DCA Code 535 (DCACODE535@ISI) via the ARPANET 
   for final validation.  DCA will then instruct BBN to set the IMP's 
   host access permission words to allow traffic to pass to and from the
   host.  Before this validation can occur, the host liaison must 
   provide the NIC and DCA Code 535 via ARPANET with his or her full 
   name, U.S. mailing address, phone number, and network mailbox (if 
   this has not already been done), as well as the host name, host 
   address, operating system, computer configuration, and network 
   sponsor for the newly installed host.  NOTE:  Please choose the host 
   name carefully so that it does not need to be changed.  Unnecessary 
   host name changes create confusion and require considerable extra 
   data maintenance throughout the network. 

   C.  AUTHORIZING USERS FOR ARPANET ACCESS - Permission to use the 
   ARPANET can only be granted by authorized host administrators to 
   users with valid accounts.  The liaison should refer all requests for
   such access to the proper administrators or the principal 
   investigators of government contracts before permitting a user to 
   access the ARPANET.  ARPANET users must provide the NIC with their 
   name, address, phone number and network mailbox.  They must also 
   include the name of the government agency sponsoring their use of the
   ARPANET.   Users who are not members of U.S. government agencies must
   also provide the contract number under which they are working and its
   expiration date to the NIC before using the ARPANET.  (TIP users 
   should include in addition the name of the TIP that they normally use
   for access.)  This information will be used to produce the ARPANET 
   Directory and will be listed in the NIC's ARPANET Directory Data 
   Base.  Liaison should periodically review accounts with ARPANET 
   access.  Users whose access to the ARPANET is no longer required or 
   valid should be removed, and the NIC should be so informed.

   The host account administrator or principal investigator is required 
   to validate his users or contractors, and to see that the NIC is 
   informed of any changes either directly or through the host liaison. 
   The host liaison will inform all local account administrators or 
   principal investigators of this procedure and assist them in keeping 
   the user information updated.  If, after following this procedure, 
   there are still doubts about whether a user can have ARPANET access, 
   contact DCA Code 535 for final arbitration.  NOTE:  If an individual 
   has not been approved by the proper administrator and has not been 
   listed in the NIC data base, he or she should not be using the 
   ARPANET.  All unauthorized use of the ARPANET is prohibited.

   D.  MONITORING GATEWAY ACCESS -  If it is possible to gain access to 
   the ARPANET from another network (gateway) or from a tributary 
   terminal of a host via the IMP-host connection, it is the 
   responsibility of that host to provide software protection which will
   permit only authorized ARPANET users to access the network.  These 
   interfaces must be documented by letter to DCA for approval.  The 
   letter should provide a brief description of the interface, who uses 
   it, and the software and/or hardware protection mechanism.  DCA 
   reserves the right to disapprove such gateways.  The liaison should 
   inform administrators of local or 'foreign' networks, who might wish 
   to establish gateway connections to the ARPANET, of this procedure, 
   and disallow any gateway access until it has been approved.

   E.  DISTRIBUTION OF TIP PHONE NUMBERS - Distribution of TIP dial-in 
   numbers is entrusted to the TIP liaison.  These numbers should not be
   released to requesting users unless the release has been authorized 
   by the TIP's sponsor.  TIP numbers will be changed annually on a 
   schedule published by DCA.  Evidence of unauthorized use of these 
   numbers should be reported to DCA.  The liaison should emphasize to 
   the user when providing the dial-in number, that the number is for 
   his use alone.  If it is found that the user has passed the number to
   unauthorized parties, the user's access rights will be revoked.

   F.  AUTHORIZING DEDICATED TIP PORTS - Prior to a TIP port being 
   activated to support a dedicated terminal access, the TIP liaison 
   should contact DCA for final validation.  The request should contain 
   the information outlined in the TIP inventory below.  It should also 
   include the desired activation date so that DCA can request that the 
   NCC enable the TIP port on that date.

2.  The liaison help to coordinate equipment moves or installations, or 
circuit moves or installations affecting the ARPANET backbone or the 
IMPs and/or TIPS.  Info copies of Telecommunications Service Requests 
(TSR's) will be sent to the liaison from DCA, informing them of any 
changes in backbone circuitry, terminal and/or host additions/deletions.
The liaison should help coordinate access to the IMP or TIP by TEL CO or
BBN to perform actions called for in the TSRs.  Unless a TSR has been 
received authorizing equipment moves/installations or circuit 
moves/additions, no such moves or installations should be made without 
contacting DCA Code 535 for authorization.  Normal maintenance actions 
are excluded.  NOTE:  Liaison for hosts/TIPS on Army installations 
should be aware that circuit changes/connections must be coordinated 
with the U.S. Army Communications Command (USACC) and copies of TSRs 
provided to the post C-E officer.

3.  TIP liaison are required to forward to DCA Code 535 a quarterly TIP 
inventory in the format outlined below (RCS #DCA(Q)530-49).  The 
inventory is due by the 15th of January, April, July, and October of 
each year. Transmission via ARPANET is acceptable.  A copy of the 
inventory should also be provided to the agency sponsoring the TIP.  
NOTE:  A report is required indicating that no changes have occurred if 
this happens to be the case.

4.  In the first five working days of each month the NIC will provide 
via the ARPANET, a table of ARPANET Host Names, Liaison, and Sponsors.  
Liaison will be asked to review entries on this list pertaining to their
TIPs or Hosts for accuracy, and to provide changes as soon as possible 
to the NIC.  If host or TIP liaison are changed, the old liaison should 
provide the name, address, telephone number, and network mailbox of the 
new liaison to both the NIC and DCA Code 535 as soon as possible.

5.  Each liaison is expected to provide the NIC with a description of 
equipment, software, people, and interests pertaining to their 
designated hosts in accordance with the formats outlined by the NIC.

6. In addition each liaison is responsible for providing the NIC with 
updated personnel information for the ARPANET Directory and online 
ARPANET Directory Data Base.  This may be done in coordination with 
sponsors, host administrators, and principal investigators.  For very 
large organizations this activity may be delegated to an individual 
other than the liaison.  Also, individual users may send their own 
information via the network to the NIC.  However, it is the 
responsibility of the liaison to coordinate the flow of this information
from his or her host(s) to the NIC.

7.  The liaison is expected to keep local users informed about 
procedures and happenings related to the ARPANET (such as announcements 
in the ARPANET Newsletter).  The Liaison will be the recipient of 
official messages pertaining to the ARPANET.  These messages should be 
'posted' and/or passed on to local users, administrators, or other 
personnel who may have an interest or a need to know.  Unless otherwise 
specified, messages sent to the liaison are considered general 
information messages which can be widely distributed to user and 
administrative constituencies.

8.  The liaison serve as the local ARPANET contact for their respective 
host(s).  The liaison provide information to their local users about 
ARPANET procedures, and they also provide information to non-local 
ARPANET users about local host procedures and resources.  They often 
assist in bringing up new hosts by providing network software and 
folklore.  The liaison can either provide help directly or refer users 
to the proper local contact.  Requests by users for information about 
other ARPANET hosts may be referred to the liaison of the host in 
question or to the NIC.  (As a rule of thumb the NIC answers general 
questions about contacts, procedures, and resources on the ARPANET, and 
the liaison answer specific questions about their own hosts.)

9.  Liaison should inform the NCC and DCA of network backbone problems 
and network software bugs, and generate Unsatisfactory Service Reports 
if necessary.  They ensure that ARPANET protocols are implemented 
properly at the host level.  (This activity may be delegated if the 
liaison is not the maintainer of the network software.  However, the 
liaison is expected to be the contact for protocol information 
distributed to the hosts and to see that the right person receives it.)

10.  If an illegal access to the host occurs through the ARPANET, the 
liaison will advise DCA of the pertinent details in addition to 
following normal host security procedures.
