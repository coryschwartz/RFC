                 TOPIC:  - ARPANET IMPs and TACs

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    On 30 March 83, a letter was sent to the Military Services and Government 
Agencies which participate in the ARPANET, announcing the establishment of the 
Defense Data Network - MILNET, and assumption of responsibility by the Defense 
Communications Agency for the IMPS and TACs, currently on the ARPANET, which 
are to become part of the MILNET. The text of that letter is quoted below.

   HEIDI B. HEIDEN Colonel, USA Program Manager Defense Data Network

------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUBJ:  ESTABLISHMENT OF THE DEFENSE DATA NETWORK - UNCLASSIFIED SEGMENT
       (MILNET)

1. Effective 4 April 1983 the MILNET, a functional part of the Defense Data 
Network (DDN), is established.  The MILNET, serving the computer systems listed
in Enclosure 1, will provide reliable, survivable, unclassified communications 
between host computers throughout the United States and, in the near future, 
will expand services overseas.  MILNET nodes and TACs transitioning to DCA 
management are listed in Enclosure 2.

2. Initially the MILNET will be fully integrated with the ARPANET until ARPANET
and MILNET resources can be reconfigured into separate networks. The 
reconfiguration will be evolutionary, resulting in physically separate networks
in early 1984.  This separation is being undertaken for two reasons:

   a. To increase the level of resource protection afforded to MILNE
      hosts while providing reliable, survivable service; and,

   b. To return the ARPANET to its original purpose as a small
      experimental research network upon which to develop and test
      new computer and communications concepts and protocols.

3. Once the networks are separated all MILNET hosts will continue to exchange 
electronic mail with the ARPANET, and those MILNET hosts which require full 
internet communications with the ARPANET including file transfer and terminal 
access will be provided those services via mail bridges installed by the DCA.  
While mail bridges derive their name from the fact that they pass electronic 
mail between the two networks without restrictions, they also have the 
capability, on a host-pair permission basis, to function as full internet 
gateways.  Four such bridges are being installed between the MILNET and the 
ARPANET to ensure that approved MILNET hosts have full communications services 
with the ARPANET where required.

4. MILNET hosts whose requirements dictate a more restricted operational 
environment may, at their request, be placed in a separate, closed community of
interest.  Hosts within this closed community will have full communications 
services among themselves, but will only have electronic mail service to and 
from hosts which are not part of the closed community.

5. Information concerning requests for new service will be forthcoming by 
separate letter.
