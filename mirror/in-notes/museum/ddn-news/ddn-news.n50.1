                     DDN USER DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE
                     ----------------------------

Here's good news for users of the Defense Data Network, as well as for
protocol implementors, DoD contractors, and administrative personnel:
two reference documents -- the DDN Protocol Handbook and the DDN New
User Guide -- have been published by the DDN Network Information
Center (NIC) on behalf of the Defense Data Network Defense
Communications System (DDN DCS). These documents are easy to order
from the NIC, DTIC or, for military users only, their military
communications commands office.

Other documents available from the NIC which may be of interest are:
the ARPANET Information Brochure, the DDN Protocol Implementations and
Vendors Guide, and the Request for Comments technical notes (RFCs).
Each of these documents is described below, including information
about how you can order copies.  In addition you will be happy to
know that a new version of the TAC User Guide is currently being
reviewed and will be released soon by the DDN DCS.  Watch for future
announcements in a DDN Newsletter about this and other DDN documents
as they become available.

Copies of the documents described below are available from the NIC for
the minimal cost of reproduction and handling, and all have been
deposited at DTIC.  Both DTIC and NIC ordering numbers and procedures
are provided below for your convenience.  The intent of both the NIC
and the DDN DCS is to make these basic network documents available
through a variety of sources to accommodate the various needs of the
military subscribers, military contractors, and network designers and
implementors.


                        DDN PROTOCOL HANDBOOK

The DDN Protocol Handbook is the basic reference resource for protocol
implementors and network researchers.  This document is essential for
the implementation of required protocols on network hosts.  It gathers
together the military standards, pertinent RFCs, related references,
and recommended reading into one compact, easily-referenced
three-volume set.  The DDN Protocol Handbook has been extensively
revised and contains the most up-to-date material on DoD protocol
implementations.  This handbook obsoletes several earlier documents,
including the 1982 Internet Transition Workbook and related documents.

Volume One contains the military standard (MIL STD) versions of the
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), Internet Protocol (IP), and
associated DoD application protocols required for connecting a host to
the DDN.  Volume One also contains administrative directives and
guidelines pertaining to the DDN.

Volume Two contains the protocol specifications for the DARPA Internet
protocol suite, specifically TCP, IP, TELNET, FTP, SMTP and several
associated protocols.  It summarizes the protocol review and
acceptance process for the DARPA Internet.

Volume Three includes implementation guidelines and auxiliary
documents useful for implementing protocols on both the DDN and DARPA
Internet.

The cost of the 2,749 page three-volume set is $110, which includes
shipping.  Shipments outside the U.S. are $130 per set.  Non-military
users who are California residents must add 6.5% sales tax to the
total cost of the shipment.  A limited number of these sets are also
available for distribution to military personnel through military
communications command offices.  The NIC can supply the proper
points of contact at these command offices.

The DTIC order numbers for these volumes are: Vol. 1 AD-A166 324; 
Vol. 2 AD-A166 325; Vol. 3 AD-A166 326.


                          DDN NEW USER GUIDE

The DDN New User Guide was designed as a quick and easy reference
guide aimed at simplifying network access for the new user.  It
presents an overview of the DDN, describing such network services as
how to transfer files (FTP), how to make remote connections (TELNET),
and how to send electronic mail.  Step-by-step scenarios for
interacting with the network are included, as is an extensive glossary
of terminology, and a look at administrative and technical aspects of
the DDN.  This document is invaluable for introducing new users to the
DDN.

The cost of the DDN New User Guide is $10 in the U.S. and $13 outside
of the U.S., which includes shipping.  Non-military, California
residents must add 6.5% sales tax to the total cost of the shipment.
The DTIC order number is AD-A166 368.  Online copies of the document
may be obtained from host SRI-NIC via FTP using pathname
NETINFO:NUG.DOC.  A limited number of these documents are available
from military communications command offices; military users are
advised to check this source first.


                     ARPANET INFORMATION BROCHURE

The requirements for subscriber access to the ARPANET have been
changing since the split of the original ARPANET into the experimental
ARPANET and the operational MILNET.  This has caused some confusion
for potential network subscribers.  The ARPANET Information Brochure
explains the administrative steps to connect a host computer to the
ARPANET subnet of the DDN, and describes subscriber access procedures,
ARPANET management policies, and services available for obtaining
information about the network.

In addition, a convenient list of current DDN DCS, DARPA, and other
network service contacts is provided.  The list includes names,
telephone numbers, electronic mailbox addresses, and U.S. postal
addresses of these contacts.

This document costs $10 in the U.S. and $13 outside of the U.S.,
including shipping.  Non-military California residents must add 6.5%
to the total cost of the shipment. Its DTIC order number is 
AD-A164 353.  Online copies of the document may be obtained from 
host SRI-NIC via FTP using pathname NETINFO:AIB.DOC.


          DDN PROTOCOL IMPLEMENTATIONS AND VENDORS GUIDE

If you are looking for a software or hardware product that is
compatible with the DDN TCP/IP protocols, the DDN Protocol
Implementation and Vendors Guide may be the reference you need.  The
guide is a compilation of TCP/IP- and X.25-compatible vendor
products and machine-specific implementations.  The information is
presented in a concise format, and vendor contacts are included.  This
document is updated twice a year in order to provide the most current
information possible.  Please note that the guide is merely an attempt
to bring such information together into a convenient list of known
TCP/IP- and X.25-compatible hardware or software implementations.
Inclusion of a product in the list does not imply official endorsement
of the product by the DoD or the DDN DCS.

The cost is $20 in the U.S. and $23 outside of the U.S., including
shipping.  Non-military California residents must add 6.5% sales tax
to the total cost of the shipment.  The DTIC order number is 
AD-A173 060.  Online copies can be obtained from host SRI-NIC via FTP 
using pathname NETINFO:VENDORS-GUIDE.DOC.


                HARDCOPY REQUESTS FOR COMMENTS (RFCs)

Requests for Comments (RFCs) are technical notes which describe
progress of developing internet protocols and which serve as a forum
for the introduction and discussion of new protocols.  The RFCs
chronicle many facets of protocol research and development,
particularly in the areas of protocol design and internetworking.
Some RFCs have become part of the official DARPA and/or DoD suite of
protocols and, thus, are included in the DDN Protocol Handbook.
Individual RFCs may be purchased from the NIC.  The complete index
listing all the RFCs is also available for purchase.

Each RFC of less than 100 pages costs $5 in the U.S. and $7 outside of
the U.S.  This cost applies to the RFC index as well.  Those few RFCs
which are 100 or more pages cost $10 in the U.S. and $13 outside of
the U.S.  All prices include shipping.  Non-military California residents
must add 6.5% sales tax to the total cost of the shipment.  Online copies
can be obtained from host SRI-NIC via FTP using pathname RFC:RFCnnn.txt
(where "nnn" is the RFC number).


                  RFC HARDCOPY SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE

In response to numerous requests, the NIC will be offering hardcopy
subscription service to the RFCs, beginning in January 1987.  Users
who subscribe to this service will automatically be sent each new RFC
in hardcopy form as it is published.  The subscription will include
all those RFCs that are designated for "unlimited" distribution, as
well as a complete up-to-date index issued each December.

The cost per subscription is $200 per year (domestic) or $230 per year
(overseas).  To receive a subscription to this service, send a check or
purchase order in US dollars, made payable to SRI International, to
the DDN Network Information Center at the address listed below.


                ORDERING INFORMATION FOR NIC DOCUMENTS

To order documents from the NIC, submit a check, money order or
purchase order for the amount of the order made payable to SRI
International.  Include the titles of the documents, and the quantity
desired of each document you are ordering.  Since all documents are
mailed via 4th class, U.S. Postal Mail, expect up to four to six weeks
