             TOPIC:  - Misuse of the ARPANET

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Liaison,

We have received many complaints from users about a chain letter that 
has circulated around the ARPANET since mid February.  Such use of the 
Net is contrary to DoD policy, and those who participate in such or who 
permit it's continued occurrence via facilities under their control do 
so at risk.  Early efforts to stop the circulation of this chain letter 
have been ineffective, and more drastic measures are being considered, 
up to and including the possibility of removing entire facilities from 
the net if appropriate.

Please assist us by informing your users that they must not forward such
messages under any circumstances, and that they risk loss of Net 
privileges by so doing.  Some users already have lost their access to 
the Net because of this matter.

We greatly prefer to see matters of this nature corrected at the 
liaison/host level, but will not hesitate to act if results are not 
forthcoming.

Major Glynn Parker
ARPANET Management Branch
Defense Communications Agency
