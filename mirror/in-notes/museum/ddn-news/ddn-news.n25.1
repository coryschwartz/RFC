NEW FORMAT FOR NEWSLETTER.

With this issue, the DoD NETWORK NEWSLETTER becomes the DEFENSE DATA NETWORK 
NEWSLETTER, marking the official beginning of the DDN in April 1983.  Though
directed primarily at the numerous subnets making up the DDN, the DDN 
Newsletter, for the foreseeable future, will continue to serve as a source of 
information for users of the ARPANET as well. This, and future editions of the 
DDN Newsletter will be published in a new format, with different sections for 
OFFICIAL and UNOFFICIAL articles.  Articles in the OFFICIAL section will
contain policy announcements and other general information which is being
disseminated for review, adherence, and possible response.  Articles in the
UNOFFICIAL Section will contain general information items which do not
necessarily represent official policy or practice.  As space permits, this
section may include items submitted by users.  Such items should be as brief
as possible, and should be forwarded to NIC@SRI-NIC for consideration.  All
articles for the UNOFFICIAL section should be signed and provide the
organizational affiliation of the contributor.

----------


SUBSCRIPTIONS WANTED.

Along with the change in name and format, the DDN Newsletter gains a greatly 
expanded role as the official means by which the DDN Program Management Office 
communicates with DDN and ARPANET users.  To this end, a significant increase
in circulation is sought.  Two means of accomplishing this are feasible.

The first means of increasing circulation is by remailing at the host level.
This clearly is the more efficient method, and avoids building the mailing list
at the NIC into something unmanageable.  Host Administrators and Technical
Liaison personnel are therefore requested, where feasible, to remail the DDN 
Newsletter to all account holders on their host.  Remailing is particularly 
solicited for this edition of the DDN-NEWS.

The second means is by direct mailing from the NIC.  Although not the desired 
approach, an increase in size of the NIC mailing list is feasible within 
limits.  Users with accounts at hosts which cannot provide remailing of the 
newsletter may, therefore, obtain a copy directly from the NIC by submitting a 
request for subscription directly to NIC@SRI-NIC.

NEW TAC INVENTORY REPORT REQUIREMENT

In Newsletter 22, the March submission of the Tac Inventory Report
was deferred pending reevaluation and revision of the requirements and format
for the report.  That process having been completed, the new requirements and
format are as follows.

Who:         The Tac Inventory Report is submitted by the Technical Liaison
             for each TAC.  Reports are required for all TACs,
             whether on the MILNET or ARPANET.  TAC users, especially of 
             hard-wired terminal ports, are requested to assist the TAC Liaison
             in gathering the information for this report.

What:        See format below.

When:        The first report is required not later than 27 May 1983.
             Subsequent reports are required by the end of each quarter 
             thereafter beginning with the September submission.

Where:       Submit reports via electronic mail to the mailbox 
             TACSTATRPT@SRI-NIC.
  
How:         The complete report must be submitted each time and must
             be complete and accurate.  Incomplete reports will require
             resubmission.

Why:         During the next year, we will be engaged in a massive rehoming
             effort to relocate MILNET users to MILNET TACs and ARPANET users
             to ARPANET TACs.  We need the information requested in this report
             in order to accomplish this task with least disruption to the
             users affected.  Your assistance in providing us with this data
             in the manner and timeliness requested will be a major
             contribution in the effort to accomplish this.  The importance
             of this first submission of the revised TAC Inventory Report
             cannot (repeat) cannot be overemphasized.  This data will
             provide the basis for exhaustive analysis which is vital
             to successful network partitioning.  Failure to provide
             complete and timely information will result in denial of service
             to TAC users.

6. Other Comments: (Use this section to appraise us of any other information
pertaining to your TAC users which you believe we should be aware of):
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


In most cases, providing this information will require direct contact between
the Liaison and the user.  It is extremely important that all of the
information requested be provided.  Without it, we will be unable to  
rehome users to their appropriate net, and this will result in denial of 
service to those hard-wired TAC users who remain connected to the wrong net.
Question pertaining to this report may be directed to Major Parker at
(703)285-5133 or AV 356-5133, or by netmail to GPARK@BBNC.

DDN-DIGEST.

Our thanks to Steve Nelson and Pete Vayda for their timely and excellent
suggestion that we begin a DDN-DIGEST, similar to the TCP-IP Digest published
by Mike Muuss, to keep you, the users, informed about the DDN and to get 
feedback from you as well.  To this end, we have established the mailbox 
DDN-NEWS@SRI-NIC to receive questions, comments, and the like which you want
to send us.  These we will incorporate in the UNOFFICIAL section of the 
Newsletter (allowing for duplication) along with an answer from an appropriate
person.  More on this in future Newsletters, but in the meanwhile, the mailbox
is there and ready for your use.
