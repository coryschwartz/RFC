                   -   MILNET/ARPANET HOST AND TAC ALIGNMENT LIST

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TAC-NEWS SERVICE

A news service for TACs has been installed.  This service will be used
to inform TAC users of important changes in the ARPANET and MILNET, as
well as for TAC-specific notices.  To  reach this service from a  TAC,
use the "@n" command to the TAC and the connection will  automatically
be made.   The user  should then  log in  with username  "tacnews"  or
"tac-news" (no password  required).  The tacnews  program will scan  a
mailbox of  notices  in  reverse chronological  order  when  the  "@n"
command is invoked.


MILNET/ARPANET HOST AND TAC ALIGNMENT LIST

In DDN Newsletter No. 31, dated 1 Sep 83, TAC users were advised  that
they should know the net alignments  of the TACs and Hosts which  they
commonly use.   This knowledge  is especially  critical following  the
MILNET/ARPANET  split  (4 Oct 83) and  the two test days  preceding it 
(8 and 15 Sep 83).  A complete list of TACs and Hosts on each net will
be placed in a notice available through the TAC-News Service described
above.   All  TAC users  should obtain  a copy of this  list prior  to 
8 Sep 83.

TAC users are also reminded that  they must use the complete  internet
address scheme  if they  wish to  connect  to a  host on  a  different
network from  the TAC  they are  using.  An example  of this  form  of
address is: 10.1.0.40, where

   10 is the network number of the host being accessed (10 for ARPANET,
      26 for MILNET);

    1 is the port number of the host being accessed;

    0 is reserved and currently is usually 0;

   40 is the number of the IMP to which the host is connected.
