ARPANET LIAISON INVITED TO MEETINGS TO DISCUSS TCP/IP TRANSITION

   The ARPANET Liaison are cordially invited to attend one of two 
   meetings scheduled for March 1982 - one on the East Coast and one on 
   the West Coast - to discuss the planned transition from the NCP 
   protocols to the TCP/IP protocols during 1982.  This transition is 
   part of a larger DoD standardization activity which was set into 
   motion in April 1980 by Gerald Dinneen, then the Assistant Secretary 
   of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence.  In
   his April 3, 1980 directive, Dr. Dinneen identified the Transmission 
   Control Protocol and Internet Protocol as ratified DoD standards and 
   placed DCA in charge of managing their further development, 
   specification, and application in multinetwork environments.

   Since that time, DCA, DARPA, and other DoD representatives have 
   worked to refine the specifications and to test a variety of 
   implementations on a wide range of computers, operating systems, and 
   networks.  Just as it did a decade ago, tha ARPANET community is 
   leading the way into a new networking territory of great importance 
   to the future of US military command and control systems.  This 
   transition effort on the ARPANET has the sanction and encouragement 
   of the DCA ARPANET Management Branch and the DoD protocol 
   standardization organization as well as the support of the Office of 
   the Undersecretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications 
   and Intelligence.

THE C/30 UPGRADE ON THE ARPANET

   The ARPANET IMPs and TIPs are based on Honeywell 516 and 316 
   computers which are reaching the limit of their useful lifetimes.  
   Bolt Beranek and Newman has developed a replacement processor called 
   a C/30 which has already been installed at a number of sites on the 
   ARPANET.  The ARPANET sponsors are generally planning to order 
   replacements through DCA for all the Honeywell IMPs on the network. 
   ARPA has ordered a number of C/30 IMPs to replace existing ones. In 
   addition, the ARPANET TIPs are being upgraded to include both NCP and
   TCP/IP software along with TELNET protocol as part of the general 
   transition into the internet environment.

   The upgraded TIPs are being re-named TACs (Terminal Access 
   Controller) and perform only host functions.  A Honeywell TIP becomes
   a TAC when it is plugged into an IMP host port and its software is 
   re-loaded to include both NCP and TCP/IP protocols.  BBN has also 
   developed a C/30 TAC and there are a few of these on the net as well.

   Over the course of calendar 1982 and probably into early 1983, the 
   Honeywell IMPs will be replaced with C/30 IMPs.  Also, all the 
   Pluribus TIPs and IMPs will be replaced with C/30 IMPs and C/30 TACs.

   As an ARPANET sponsor, DARPA/IPTO has ordered or will order C/30 IMPs
   during 1982 to replace all the Honeywell or Pluribus IMPs for which 
   it is responsible.  Honeywell TIPs will be converted to TACs.  In 
   1983, DARPA will begin replacing the Honeywell TACs with C/30 TACs so
   that, by the end of calendar 1983, the DARPA/IPTO sites will have 
   been fully converted to C/30 equipment.  The other ARPANET sponsors 
   have similar plans, although I cannot vouch for the precise timing of
   their actions.

   I have requested that BBN send to each site liaison a configuration 
   plan for the C/30 IMP replacements for which DARPA/IPTO is 
   responsible.  Ms. Judy Gordon (JGordon@BBN) has or will shortly be 
   sending to a subset of the liaisons, the configurations we are 
   ordering for those sites.  I would appreciate liaison review of the 
   configurations and response to Judy Gordon if there are questions or 
   problems.  Particular attention should be paid to planning for 
   connector and cable arrangements as these have often been a problem 
   area in the past when a C/30 replacement IMP arrives at a site.

   If you are a liaison who has not or does not within a couple of weeks
   received such a configuration plan, I urge you to get into contact 
   with your ARPANET sponsor to determine the plans for your C/30 IMP 
   replacement.

   Details about the C/30 product line can be obtained from Judy Gordon.

TCP/IP DIGEST

   Mike Muuss at the Ballistics Research Lab., Md. has started a special
   interest group on TCP/IP protocols which you may want to join.   He 
   would be happy to add you to the distribution list for his TCP/IP 
   Digest, and would like to receive current information on TCP 
   implementations and questions/answers on status and issues.  The NIC 
   would also like to be cc:ed (NIC@SRI-NIC) on the latter.  

   Contact Mike@BRL.

TRAVEL INSTRUCTIONS FOR LIAISON MEETINGS

   GETTING TO SRI INTERNATIONAL

   Most of the Liaison can either drive in or fly in for the day.  The 
   meeting does not start until 10 AM to give people from Southern 
   California time to get to SRI from the airport.  Hotels are listed 
   below for anyone who plans to stay overnight.

   Menlo Park is about equidistant between San Francisco or San Jose 
   airports, so flights to either airport are OK.  To get to SRI in 
   Menlo Park take Freeway 101 (also called The Bayshore) north from San
   Jose, or south from San Francisco, to the Willow Road/Menlo Park 
   (west) exit (don't take the Willow Road/Dumbarton Bridge exit or you 
   will be headed in the wrong direction).  Drive up Willow Road to the 
   3rd traffic light which will be Middlefield Road.  Turn right on 
   Middlefield Road.  At the 2nd traffic light turn left onto Ravenswood
   Ave.  SRI is a red brick building on the left.  Turn into the main 
   entrance, enter the main door behind the white pillars, and check in 
   with the receptionist.  Visitor parking is on the left facing the 
   building.

   To reach the hotels, continue over the railroad tracks to the next 
   light which will be El Camino.  Turn left if staying at the Mermaid 
   Inn or Holiday Inn and right if staying at the Menlo Motor Lodge.

   If you are not renting a car, it is best to book a limosine in 
   advance.  The limos are fairly expensive...about $18.  There are some
   buses, but the schedules are not good for reaching Menlo Park, 
   unfortunately.

   Hotels in the area are:

      (415) 328-2800

   TO GET TO BOLT, BERANEK, AND NEWMAN, INC.

      From Logan Airport, take Sumner Tunnel to Southeast Expressway - 
      North (2nd exit up the ramp after tunnel).  Take Storrow Drive 
      exit, and follow Storrow Drive to end, and then follow Rt. 2-3 
      (Fresh Pond Parkway) to Howard Johnson's.  Bear left at traffic 
      rotary, so ARCO service station is on your right.  Second right is
      Fawcett Street.  Parking is available in the small lot in front of
      the building.
