   ADDENDUM TO 1 July 1980 DCA Newsletter

        We have received several messages from users who are concerned 
   with our TIP Login development efforts.  We hope this message will 
   clarify or allay a number of these concerns.  The ARPANET is 
   comprised of a large number of sophisticated users.  We appreciate 
   their interest and advice on possible network improvements and will 
   take these into consideration in making network decisions.  The 
   ARPANET Newsletter was published in part to obtain user reaction and 
   in light of comments received, it has achieved it's purpose.

        The ARPANET currently has an operational budget of approximately
   $5,000,000 per year and represents and investment of over $50,000,000
   in hardware and software by the government.  TIP Login is a method to
   control access to resources so that they can be more effectively 
   utilized.  Our initial efforts are directed to controlling access to 
   the TIPs to prevent unauthorized users from dialing in.  It will 
   permit publishing of TIP phone numbers and allow users to be given 
   access to several TIPs as long as they have authorization for those 
   TIPs in the TIP Login data base.  This concept will be of great 
   advantage to those  authorized users who travel a lot, since they 
   would have a list of phone numbers that they can call anywhere in the
   country, and, if their data base record contains the proper 
   authorization, they can access any local TIP.  This is one advantage 
   of the TIP Login.  Other advantages are:

      a. Accurate representation of network users.  This information
         will increase the accuracy of the WHOIS program and provide
         readily available management information without the necessity
         of the user surveys which we now require.

      b. Development of regional TIPs to support the many users who are
         not associated with TIP sponsoring organizations.  With the
         present situation, we cannot spread the TIP access load among
         several TIPs in the same geographical area.  Knowing who the
         dial in users are, would enable us to shift them to TIPS that
         have spare capacity or justify a regional TIP if the load is
         too heavy.

   

        Another area of TIP Login which is of concern to some users is 
   our mention of the inclusion of controls similar to TIP login for 
   hosts.  The first point to be made is that TIP Login will study what 
   needs to be done and what can be done to control host terminal 
   access.  From our viewpoint, we wish to control unauthorized dial-in 
   access to the ARPANET through the Host front ends.  We are not trying
   to provide a statment of requirements or a design at this time.  As 
   part of the design effort we need to know the magnitude and types of 
   users, so that we can make reasonable decisions on what can and 
   should be done.  That is the reason behind our request for accurate 
   input data.

        In conclusion, TIP Login is being developed to provide the 
   authorized user with improved services.  We have attempted to reduce 
   administrative overhead while improving management control.  Some 
   thought was given to introducing a charging system similar to 
   commercial networks (e.g. by packet, or access period).  Such a 
   system would add economic realism to network use.  However, such 
   mechanisms would be costly to implement and add a lot of needless 
   administrative overhead to the ARPANET.  TIP Login will be designed 
   to support the middle road between minimal network controls that 
   presently exist on the network and complete network access and 
   billing controls as might be found on a commercial network.
