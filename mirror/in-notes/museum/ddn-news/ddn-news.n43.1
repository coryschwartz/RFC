           POLICY ON RELOCATION OF ARPANET AND DEFENSE DATA
	   ------------------------------------------------
		        NETWORK (DDN) EQUIPMENT
		        -----------------------

The following letter, subject: Relocating ARPANET and Defense Data
Network (DDN) Equipment, dated 24 May 84, is quoted by Code B642 for 
your information and serves as the DDN policy on relocation of ARPANET 
and Defense Data Network (DDN) equipment.  All requests for relocations
to node equipment on the ARPANET and DDN are to adhere to the policy 
set forth herein.

        1.  In several recent instances subscribers have submitted 
            requests to have ARPANET and DDN node equipment relocated.  
	    Requested move dates have ranged from 2 to 6 months from 
            the date the request was forwarded to DCA.

        2.  In all justifiable instances the DDN PMO action officers 
	    will accommodate the requestor by initiating the necessary 
	    actions to move the node equipment.  However, based on past 
	    experience, many such moves must be planned and executed 
	    over a period of at least a year.

        3.  A node move involves coordination and cooperation between 
	    several agencies.  Each agency is governed by its own 
	    timetables and established priorities.  

	4.  For planning purposes, a year in advance must be adhered 
	    to when considering the relocation of DDN node equipment.  
            The bulk of this time is needed to reterminate highspeed 
            data circuits (50 and 56KB).

	5.  The following factors must be taken into consideration 
	    when relocating node equipment:

	     a.  Lead Times

        	 150 days new site engineering and preparation
		 30 days DECCO action on TSR
	         120-360 days engineer and install new or rehomed 
			telephone circuits (may be extended for 
			analog and high speed data circuits)

	     b.  Other factors which impact the schedule:

		 1)  Schedule and conduct survey of new site by DCA 
			and contractor personnel.
		 2)  Deinstallation of old node/installation of new 
			node.

	6.  I [Colonel Maybaum] realize that longrange forecasting to
	    anticipate future mission requirements is a diffcult task 
	    but it is necessary to DDN or ARPANET communities.

	7.  Should a node site relocation become necessary, notify 
	    DCA, B646, Washington, D.C.  20305.

Please take note of the prior notification time frame stated in the
second sentence in paragraph 2.  which reads "...such moves must be
planned and executed over a period of at least a year."  Also, note
the following CODE change to paragraph 7, which states "...notify DCA,
B646, Washington, D.C.  20305."  The correct code is now B652.

(Ens. Linda Liggett, B642, (703) 285-5394, (V) 356-5394.)


                      NETWORK (SCINET) NAME CHANGE
		      ----------------------------		

On 19 Nov 85, the name of the previously called DODIIS or TS/SCI 
network was offically changed to SCINET (Sensitive Compartmented 
Information Network). All future references to this network must 
hereafter be referred to as the SCINET. The SCINET will eventually 
become a community of interest in the classified segment of the 
DDN when the DDN evolves into a fully integrated multilevel secure
network. (Jerry Phillips, B652, (703) 437-2481, (V) 364-2481.)


                         WINCS C/30 UPGRADE
			 ------------------

The WWMCCS Intercomputer Network Communications Subsystem (WINCS)
C/30 PSNs will be upgraded to C/30E PSNs during the months of
Jan, Feb, and Mar 86 as a part of BBNCCs normal preventive maintenance
visit to WINCS sites. The C/30E upgrade expands memory of the C/30 to 
allow deployment of future PSN software releases that requires the 
additional memory.  (Jerry Phillips, B652, (703) 437-2481, (V) 364-2471.)


	  DDN COMMUNICATIONS OPERATIONS GROUP (DDNCOG) FORMED 
          ---------------------------------------------------

The Defense Communications Agency (DCA), Defense Communications System
(DCS), Data Systems, has begun an operational forum called the Defense
Data Network Communications Operations Groups (DDNCOG).  The first
meeting was held 27-28 August at Arlington, Virginia, and was chaired
by the Defense Communications Agency (DCA) Code B645, Operations
Management Division, (now Code B650). The meeting was attended by 
representatives of the Military Departments, Military Services, 
Department of Defense (DoD) agencies, and non-DoD agencies that 
have responsibility for the operation and maintenance (O&M) of the 
Defense Data Network (DDN).

Most of the agenda for this initial meeting was devoted to information
exchange.  Presentations were given by several of the DCS Data Systems
Divisions and by some of their major contractors.  The DDNCOG was
briefed on DDN operations plans and procedures; the reorganization
plans for the DDN PMO; DDN growth and expansion issues; installation,
testing and acceptance procedures; maintenance and field service;
automation of the Telecommunications Service Requests (TSR) process;
and information services available for users.  Configuration
management of the network was discussed, and an overview of the
accepted security architecture was presented.  Monitoring center
operation, logistics support, and training were also discussed.

The remainder of the meeting was spent discussing issues of interest
to the attendees.  Security and privacy issues were discussed and the
group was briefed on plans for making network performance and usage
data available to them for planning purposes.  Representatives from
the classified network segments discussed progress they have made
using the secure architecture and DoD protocols.  Other concerns about
integration of the classified and unclassified segments of the network
were also voiced.

Several military groups outlined their plans to bring large numbers of
users onto the DDN in the near future.  They were concerned about the
procedures and timing for accomplishing this.  There was considerable
interest in documentation concerning use of the network and node
operation.  Several draft documents were on display at the meeting and
these will be available in final form in the near future.  Among these
were the DDN Subscribers Guide, the DDN Security Guide, the DDN New
User Guide, the DoD Protocol Handbook, the TAC Users Guide, a set of
network overview documents, and documents explaining the duties and
procedures of Node Site Coordinators and Host Administrators.            

A draft charter was introduced and was discussed in some detail.
There was not sufficient time to fully air all the contributions to
the charter. Cmdr. Kathy Shipman, USN, volunteered to revise the
charter based upon the discussion.  She will make it available for 
future review by the DDNCOG.

Membership in the DDNCOG is by invitation only for purposes of keeping
the group to a manageable size.  However, it is the hope of the DDNCOG
and of the Deputy Director, DCS Data Systems, that network users will
make their needs and wishes known to their DDNCOG representative so
that procedures and policies that are set will accommodate the many
requirements of the diverse DDN user community.  

The list of DDNCOG representatives can be FTPed from SRI-NIC using
the filename NETINFO:DDNCOG.TXT.  It can be obtained in hardcopy by
calling 800-235-3155 or by sending a message to NIC@SRI-NIC.ARPA.

  MINUTES AND VIEWGRAPHS OF FIRST DDNCOG MEETING AVAILABLE AT THE NIC

The minutes and viewgraphs of the first meeting of the DDNCOG are now
available from the NIC.  Those users with FTP capability may obtain
online copies of the minutes from SRI-NIC using the filename 
NETINFO:DDNCOG-MIN-1.TXT.  Hardcopies of either the minutes or the
viewgraphs are also available.  Contact the NIC for copies.

                    DATE SET FOR NEXT DDNCOG MEETING	

The second meeting of the DDNCOG will be held 25-26 Feb 1986.  A place
will be announced.  (Jack Snively, B652, (703) 285-5227, (V) 356-5227.)


           PACIFIC MILNET MONITORING CENTER (PMMC) CONTACTS
	   ------------------------------------------------

The recently established Pacific MILNET Monitoring Center (PMMC),
located in Hawaii at DCA-PAC, Wheeler AFB, is expected to
be operational in 1986. The mission of PMMC will be to monitor,
control, and support the existing and future Pacific MILNET
nodes and circuits on a continuous 24 hour-a-day, 7 day-a-week basis.
When operational, the PMMC will take over these functions from
CMMC, which will result in three separate MILNET monitoring
centers, i.e., CONUS MILNET Monitoring Center (CMMC), European
MILNET Monitoring Center (EMMC), and Pacific MILNET Monitoring
Center (PMMC).

As with the other MCs, PMMC will be operated by BBNCC personnel under
contract to DCA. The DCA-PAC Task Monitor for PMMC is Maj. Gary
Hurst, USAF, (808) 655-1202. The key PMMC personnel are:

		Manager            Jim Fitzgerald
		Network Analyst    Brian Sudis
		Sr. Controller     Dave Curry
		Database Mgr.      Glen Viernes
		Data Admin.        John Hardesty

The PMMC address and telephone numbers are:

		DCA-Pacific Area
		Attn. BBN Communications Corp.
		Wheeler AFB, Hi  96854-5000

		Tel.    (808) 655-1474
			(808) 655-1473
			(808) 655-1472
		        (808) 624-3744

The temporary online mailbox for the PMMC is Jfitzger@BBNCCT.  
Once the Wheeler Electronic Mail Host becomes operational, the
PMMC will have an account on that host. (Lt. Chris Fennig, B652, 
(703) 285-5231, (V) 356-5231.)


	    NEW VERSION OF PSN SOFTWARE UNDER DEVELOPMENT
            ---------------------------------------------

PSN Release 7.0, a new version of the Packet Switch Node (PSN)
software currently under development, will have changes which will
affect several users of the DDN.  The new version will no longer
support the 1822 Very Distant Host (VDH) interface and 1822
Uncontrolled Packet type.  These two capabilities are described in BBN
Report No. 1822, Appendix F and Section 3.6, respectively (available
from DTIC or the NIC).  PSN 7.0 is scheduled for deployment no earlier
than January 1987.  As of 1 January 1987, host systems on the DDN,
including the ARPANET, must insure that they no longer use these
services.  (Dennis Morris, B612, (703) 285-5029, (V) 356-5029.)
