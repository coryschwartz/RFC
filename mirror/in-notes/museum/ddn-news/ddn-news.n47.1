                       TAC RELEASE 113 PROBLEMS
		       ------------------------

TAC Release # 113 is gradually being deployed on DDN TACs.  Some
problems which have occurred with this release are being solved as 
they appear, but users should be aware of one notable problem.

The problem is that valid MILNET TAC cards are at times not accepted
by TACs containing Release # 113.  Sometimes a user is given a "bad
login" in response to the valid TAC User ID and Access Code.  If this
should happen, hang up and try the TAC again at a later time.  If it
persists, use another TAC (call the NIC at (800) 235-3155 or (415)
859-3695 if you do not have a TAC telephone list).  Finally, if you
cannot log in successfully after a day, call the MILNET Monitoring
Center at (202) 692-5726 to report the problem and to receive a status
report.


                    DDN NETWORK TRAINING AVAILABLE
                    ------------------------------

DDN training is now available for DoD and DARPA military and civilian
personnel involved with the DDN.  This includes users as well as site
personnel.  BBNCC (Bolt Beranek and Newman Communications Corporation),
Washington office, will provide the DDN training as outlined below.

All costs, except TDY, have been contracted for by the Defense
Communications Agency, DCS Data Systems (B600).  TDY costs must be
borne by the students' organizations.  The training schedule may be
revised based upon student densities.

Course outlines and training schedules for September to December of
1986 follow.  The number in parentheses following each class title
indicates the available DDN slots.  Candidates will receive a welcome
package which contains the time and location of the courses and other
details.
