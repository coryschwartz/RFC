         PLEASE NOTE:  - New Policy for Enabling IMP Ports

---------------------------------------------------------------------

TO:  All ARPANET Sponsors, Host Administrators, and Technical Liaison.

As the impending split of the ARPANET into the MILNET and the 
EXPERIMENTAL ARPANET draws nearer, it is increasingly important that we 
have a completely accurate data base of which hosts are on which IMP 
ports. An error could easily result in inadvertently denying service to 
a user, which we want to avoid.

Accordingly, we are asking that all new additions of hosts to the 
network, and port changes of existing hosts be coordinated with the 
Defense Data Network Program Management Office (DDN-PMO) prior to 
implementation.  BBN has been instructed to disable all currently unused
ports, and to enable them only upon approval from the DDN-PMO.

Requests for port assignment and activation should be sent to the 
following netmail addresses for action:

   DCACODE252 at USC-ISI
   DCACODEB627 at BBNB
   GPARK at BBNB.

Info copy should be sent to

   NIC at NIC
   CONTROL at BBN-UNIX.

Allow at least one week prior to the desired activation date.
