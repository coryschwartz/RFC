              Topic: -  MILNET/ARPANET SPLIT - TEST DAYS

----------------------------------------------------------------------
As described in newsletters 26 through  29, the ARPANET will be  split
into the MILNET and the experimental  ARPANET on October 4, 1983.   In
preparation for  this  split,  two  full scale  test  days  have  been
scheduled in September.  THESE TEST DAYS ARE THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 8 AND
THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 15. The tests will involve complete cutover to the
split configuration of the two networks.  The tests commence at  12:00
NOON EST and terminate at 12:00 NOON EST the following day.

Host administrators must ensure that  new host name tables are  loaded
at the  start  and  finish  of the  tests.   (An  upcoming  Management
Bulletin will have further details on host table updating.)  For hosts
moving to MILNET, administrators must also ensure that their host uses
its new network 26 address during the test period.

During the  tests,  users of  TACs  should  be aware  of  the  network
alignment of the TACs and hosts they use.  Every effort should be made
to use a TAC on the same network as the host being accessed.

Further details concerning the split, and its ramifications for  users
and administrators,  may  be  found  in  the  above-mentioned  network
newsletters.
