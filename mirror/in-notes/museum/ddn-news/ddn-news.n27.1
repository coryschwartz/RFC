   Topic: - More Details on the MILNET/ARPANET Split

----------------------------------------------------------------------

           FURTHER DETAILS ON THE ARPANET/MILNET SPLIT

Introduction

As previously discussed  in DDN  Newsletter 26,  the existing  ARPANET
will soon  be split  into  two separate  networks -  the  experimental
ARPANET and the operational  MILNET.  Hosts on  the two networks  will
intercommunicate  via  mail  bridges,   using  the  internet   gateway
mechanisms to pass  mail traffic  between hosts on  the two  networks.
The mail bridges will,  on a controlled  basis, provide full  internet
gateway services for MILNET hosts that request it.

The Logical Split

Because it takes a large amount of time and effort to physically split
a network  in a  coherent manner,  the ARPANET  will initially,  on  4
October  1983,  be  logically  partitioned  by  the  use  of  existing
mechanisms in the IMPs to enforce  segregation of hosts and TACs  into
separate communities of  interest.  Each community  of interest  (COI)
becomes a virtual network,  i.e., hosts (including  TACS) in the  same
community can fully interoperate as is currently the case, while hosts
in different communities  cannot directly  intercommunicate. This,  in
effect, transforms the ARPANET  into an Internet  in which the  MILNET
will assume  a new  class  A network  number,  network 26,  while  the
ARPANET  remains  network  10.   (Details  of  the  host   renumbering
procedures will  be covered  in a  later newsletter  from the  Network
Information Center (NIC).)

Intercommunication between the MILNET and ARPANET is via mail  bridges
which use  standard internet  protocols and  mechanisms to  pass  data
between hosts in the  two networks.  This is  why the conversion  from
NCP to TCP/IP is  so important; any host  with a fully working  TCP/IP
implementation (including ICMP, the host-gateway protocol), should see
no loss  in  service  because  of  the  split.  However,  hosts  using
incomplete TCP/IP implementations (those that do not include ICMP as a
part of  IP,  or  have  no  provision  for  using  gateways)  will  be
restricted to  communicating  with  other TCP/IP  hosts  in  the  same
network.  In particular, this means that they will not be able to send
(or receive) mail traffic  through the bridges to  hosts in the  other
network.

THERE CAN BE NO EXEMPTIONS TO THE SPLIT!!

Unlike the NCP-to-TCP  conversion which  is still underway  for a  few
hosts, once the  split occurs, there  is nothing that  can be done  to
allow a host with an incomplete TCP/IP to fully intercommunicate  with
the other  network other  than  helping them  to  convert to  a  fully
working TCP/IP as soon as possible.

Future DDN Newsletters will  discuss in greater  detail how the  split
affects the users  and host  software maintainers, and  how the  split
will be tested before it is finally implemented in October.

The Physical Split

Concurrent with  the logical  split the  network is  being  physically
split as  well.  Many  new  trunks are  being  added to  support  each
network, and  a  number of  trunks  will eventually  be  removed  once
replacement trunks have been installed.  The first quarter of CY  1984
has been established as the goal for completion of the physical split,
but this is dependent upon delivery  of new circuits from the  TELCOs,
some of which have very long lead times (over a year in some cases).

To complete the physical split, hosts and terminals which are homed on
the wrong IMP or TAC must be rehomed.  In some cases, a new IMP on the
proper network will be used;  in other cases, a  host may need to  use
HDH (the HDLC-based replacement  for VDH) in order  to gain access  to
its network via a  remote IMP.  In either  case, the host must  change
its network address,  and the TAC  users of these  hosts must be  made
aware of the change. Both host  and terminal rehoming will be kept  to
the absolute minimum possible.
