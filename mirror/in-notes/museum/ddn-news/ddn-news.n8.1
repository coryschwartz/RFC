USE OF THE ARPANET

The following is in answer to the many requests for guidelines as to who
may use the ARPANET:

   Only military personnel or ARPANET sponsor-validated persons working 
   on government contracts or grants may use the ARPANET.

DCA access enforcement policy will consist of the following procedure. 
If unauthorized users are found on the net because of a weak or 
nonexistant host access control mechanism, we will review the host's 
access mechanisms and request improvements.  If the host refuses a 
review or refuses to make the suggested improvements, we will take 
action to terminate its network access.  This is a club of last resort, 
but we will use it to protect other network users who have invested time
and money to bring their controls up to par.

If Sponsors have delegated access authority to host and TIP liaison or 
host managers, it is the duty of these delegates to enforce access 
control mechanisms for their connected systems and subsystems.  All 
hosts connected to the ARPANET...and that includes GATEWAY hosts and 
hosts with forwarding mechanisms...will implement access controls so 
that unauthorized traffic is stopped.

Files should not be FTPed by anyone unless they are files that have been
announced as ARPANET-public or unless permission has been obtained from 
the owner.  Public files on the ARPANET are not to be considered public 
files outside of the ARPANET, and should not be transferred, or their 
contents given or sold to the general public without permission of DCA 
or the ARPANET sponsors.  Hosts which use a "guest" or "anonymous" FTP 
login convention should inform their local users about the ramifications
of this convention with respect to unprotected files, as the users are 
not always aware that their files can be FTPed.

NETWORK INFORMATION GATHERING:

The NIC has been designated by DCA to run a yearly survey to obtain 
information for the ARPANET Directory.  Providing information for this 
survey is a requirement levied on all users who have ARPANET access. 
Some hosts have run similar surveys which have confused users and 
created a lot of duplicative reporting, not to mention a burden on the 
user.  In the future, we request that any survey of users for directory 
purposes, other than a survey of users on a local host, be coordinated 
through DCA and the NIC.

In addition, the NIC is authorized by DCA to collect information for the
ARPANET Resource Handbook.  Liaison or other host designates are 
expected to make this information available to the NIC on request.

TIP INVENTORY

The NIC has also been designated as the central repository for the TIP 
Inventory Data Base.  The NIC will be sending out a TIP Inventory Update
Request in the next week.  All TIP liaisons will be responsible for 
updating these reports or filling in the report where no prior input 
exists.  Response time on these reports is 9 October 1981.  If no report
is received after this period, DCA will direct BBN to software disable 
those TIP ports for which no input has been received.  If no change has 
occurred in the TIP inventory since the last report, you should send DCA
(DCACODE252@ISI) a message stating that with cc: to NIC (NIC@NIC).  Our 
new database capability will permit us to better enforce this reporting 
and make the updates hopefully, much easier.  Your cooperation is 
requested and appreciated.

FAREWELL

I will be leaving for civilian life, and wish to announce a change of 
personnel at DCA, the ARPANET Network Manager.  Cmdr Kirkwood and Capt. 
Parker will be assuming the management role.  In my two years as manager
the network has grown to approximately a 100 nodes and is in the process
of hardware and protocol modernization.  I hope it will continue to grow
in the future and provide better services and capabilities to you the 
user.  The next two years will be a time of great change and many 
interesting improvements. I really hate to leave but I must.

Good Luck,

Joe Haughney Major USAF
