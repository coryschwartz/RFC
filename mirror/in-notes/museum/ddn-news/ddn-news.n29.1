           FURTHER DETAILS ON THE ARPANET/MILNET SPLIT

Introduction

This newsletter continues a discussion begun in DDN Newsletter 26  and
continued in DDN Newsletters 27	and 28 of the upcoming  ARPANET/MILNET
split.  If you have not yet read these newsletters, you are encouraged
to do so.   Most hosts keep  publicly-accessible local copies  online.
Copies may also  be obtained  by invoking  FTP from  your local  host,
connecting  to  SRI-NIC  [10.0.0.73],   logging  in  as   'anonymous',
password='guest',  and  doing   a  'get'  on   files  with   pathnames
<DDN-NEWS>DDN-NEWS-x.txt (where 'x' is the newsletter number desired.)

Further Information for TAC Users

At the time of the Logical  ARPANET Split, some TAC users will  notice
changes because they use network  addresses rather than host names  to
establish connections  to  hosts.  At  first,  these changes  will  be
limited to the requirement  that all MILNET hosts  have a new  network
number, 26.  (ARPANET  hosts will  keep their  current network  number
10).  Later, in preparation for the physical split, some hosts will be
rehomed to a different IMP,  which will cause their network  addresses
to change.  TAC users may find that hosts which they currently  access
routinely are now  on the opposite  network.  This will  occur if  the
host resides on the network opposite the one on which the TAC resides.

To minimize any impact, each TAC user should:

   a.  Learn the network assignment for the host(s)  and TAC(s)  which
   you regularly use.  This information is available from SRI-NIC,  in
   the file <NETINFO>MILNET-ARPANET.LIST.  Then always use a TAC  that
   is on the same network as your primary host when possible.  If  you
   use dial-in lines and there is a TAC on each network in  your area,
   you should  dial in to the TAC on the same network as  the host you
   intend to access.

   b.  Contact  the  Liaison for  the  TAC(s) you  normally  use,  and
   register your usage of that TAC.  When registering, include whether
   you dial in or are full period (give your port number), your  name,
   address, phone number, network  mailbox, and whether you  primarily
   require MILNET or ARPANET access,  based upon the alignment of  the
   hosts that you intend to access.

   A list of  TAC liaisons  can be obtained  by invoking  FTP at  your
   local host, connecting to the SRI-NIC (10.0.0.73) machine,  logging
   in as 'anonymous', with password 'guest', and doing a 'get' on  the
   pathname <NETINFO>TAC-LIAISON.TXT.

   c.  Learn how  to specify  internet numeric addresses  to the  TAC.
   The TAC accepts three forms of addresses:

      (1)  The host/imp form:  (e.g.  1/22 for  ISIA).  This  form  is
      acceptable if the TAC  and host are on  the same network.   Note
      that 1/22 on the MILNET specifies a different host than 1/22  on
      the ARPANET.  (E.g., 1/22 on MILNET means  26.1.0.22 while  1/22
      on ARPANET means 10.1.0.22).

      (2)  The network:host/imp form: (e.g. 10:1/22  for ISIA).   This
      form  uniquely identifies ISIA no matter which  network your TAC
      is on.

      (3) The internet dotted decimal (a.b.c.d) form: (e.g.  10.1.0.22
      for ISIA).  In the  ARPANET and the MILNET,  "a" is the  network
      number, "b" is the  host port number, "c"  is the  logical  host
      field,  and is usually set to  zero, and "d" is the IMP  number.
      In the  ARPA internet,  using  this form  often makes  the  most
      sense  because many  networks are not made up of hosts and  IMPs
      and the interpretation  of the various  portions of the  address
      may differ.  For example,  the address of  the host CMU-CS-G  is
      128.2.254.132; the 128.2 specifies  the network number, and  the
      254.132 specifies a certain host  on that network (which is,  in
      fact, an Ethernet local-area network).

   The TACs now  accept internet  addresses (type  (3) above) for  TCP
   opens, and users are encouraged  to use these forms of  addressing.
   The   TAC    User's    Manual   (available    from    SRI-NIC    as
   <NETINFO>TAC-USER.DOC) contains  more  information  concerning  the
   different  forms  of  addresses.   (Note:  <NETINFO>TAC-USER.SCRIBE
   contains a SCRIBE-formatted version.)

   d.  Report  all problems  that you  encounter to  TACBUGS@BBN-UNIX.
   Reports of problems get your problems fixed;  they cannot be  fixed
   if they are not reported.
