                       ARPANET NEWSLETTER
   

---------------------------------------------------------------------

GREETINGS:

Once again we provide "pearls of wisdom" on actions and planning for the
ARPANET which directly concern your hosts and you as Liaison.  Pleading 
ignorance of the items discussed will no longer be considered a valid 
excuse for liaison nonparticipation.

CIRCUIT INSTALLATION

We have had some problems recently with Telephone Company personnel 
arriving at a site to install a circuit, only to have the liaison refuse
them entrance.  When DCA issues a Telecommunications Service Request 
(TSR) for a new circuit, we provide an information copy to the liaison. 
Granted these TSRs are not always easily understandable since they are 
in a machine input format; however, block 401 is the 'remarks' section, 
and we normally attempt to explain in that section what is going on.  
You should keep all copies of TSRs for reference so that if the 
telephone company calls up to install, remove, or change a circuit, you 
are aware of what is going on.  If you have any questions or do not have
a record of the TSR, please call us or send us a letter.  We will 
attempt to answer your questions and provide clarification.

An example of a situation which has recently caused confusion is one in 
which a site has all of its host ports filled, and the Liaison there is 
puzzled as to why we are ordering an additional wideband circuit.  The 
added circuit is needed for the planned expansion of the network which 
will require the installation of additional backbone circuits at 
existing sites (most nodes can take three or more).

NODE RELOCATIONS

Over the next two years, we will replace all of the H316s and H516s on 
the network with C/30's.  If you are planning to move your existing 
node, you may want to plan to have the move coincide with the C/30 
installation.  If you do plan to move the node, please let your Sponsor 
know, so that he can advise us.  The C/30 installation TSR will not 
cover the move of the supporting circuitry.  Based upon the Spronsor's 
request we will write additional TSRs to move the backbone circuits, and
any other circuits that we ordered, to the new location.  Local circuit 
relocations are your responsiblity and will normally be performed 
through the telephone company and/or the local  government telephone 
management office.

TIP INVENTORY

We recently put out new guidelines in a past newsletter on TIP inventory
reporting.  TIP Inventory Reports last quarter were noticeable by their 
absence.  These reports are NOT opitonal.  If there is no change to the 
previous report, so state.  In addition, the NIC will now be responsible
for maintaining the TIP inventory data base.  Thus, all TIP Inventory 
Reports should go directly to the NIC with an information copy to DCA.  
NOTE:  Those TIP ports for which TIP inventory information is not 
provided will be considered not in use and will be software disabled as 
of 1 August 1981.  Ports can be reenabled by providing the required TIP 
inventory information to the NIC and DCA who, upon receipt of the 
information, will direct the NCC to reenable the port.

96 BIT HEADER

The 96 bit header software has been fully implemented on the network. 
Congratulations and thanks to those of you who worked to make the 
cutover successful.  Our next major netwide effort will be to cutover 
all hosts to the new DOD Standard Protocols by 1 January of 1983.  This 
is the cutoff date and it will be enforced.  Network implementation 
details will be made available in follow-on newsletters.

TIP ACCESS

The advent of lowcost, home computer systems has subjected the ARPANET 
to increased probing by computer freaks.  We are implementing in the 
near future, a TIP Log-in which will provide additional network access 
control.  At present, however, only procedural controls can be 
implemented.  When TIP Liaison pass out TIP dial-up phone numbers, they 
should advise the user that the number is for his or her use only and 
should not be passed on to anyone else (co-worker, relative, etc.).  It 
should also be pointed out that by passing out the number to 
unauthorized persons, that the user is denying service to himself.  The 
unauthorized user can hog the dial-up port, thus preventing legitimate 
user access.  Further, dial-up access may be cut off until the advent of
TIP Log-in, for those sites where it is established that illegal use 
continues to cause problems.  Thus it is in the user's best interests to
keep his or her dial-in number secure.
