                   Topic: -   TEST DAY REMINDER

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Two tests  of the  MILNET/ARPANET  Split were scheduled  for 8 SEP and  
15 SEP prior to  the final  cutover on  4  OCT.  The  first  test  was
successfully completed as  scheduled.  No  significant  problems  were
discovered with  the design  of the Split.  Although  some hosts  were
observed using the wrong gateways  and not responding to redirects  as
required, the mailbridges themselves performed well.  Several problems
were noted with table entries and these have been corrected.

The second test  will be conducted  15 SEP as planned.  The test  will
begin at  12:00  Noon  and  will continue  until  12:00  Noon  of  the
following day.  Some minor degradation may be noticed during the first
hour of the test as IMPs and TACs are reloaded with the test tables.

Host administrators are reminded that they must obtain an updated copy
of the host  name tables from  the NIC  prior to the  test.  (See  DDN
Management Bulletin No. 13 available from SRI-NIC  [10.0.0.73] via FTP
from your local host using pathname= <DDN-NEWS>DDN-MGT-BULLETIN-13.TXT,
username=anonymous, and password=guest.)

TAC users should obtain an updated copy of the HOST/TAC ALIGNMENT FILE
which is available from the TAC  News-server. The  new edition of this
file will be  available on Wednesday,  14 Sep, and  contains the  port
numbers of the hosts listed.
