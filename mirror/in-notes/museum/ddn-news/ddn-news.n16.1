         TOPIC:  - Reminder of TCP/IP test, 1 Oct 1982
                 - SMTP implementations needed by Jan. 1983
                 - Documents available from NIC
                 - Implementation survey being taken

---------------------------------------------------------------------

REMINDER - TCP/IP TEST FRIDAY, 1 OCT 1982

   You are all reminded again that a netwide test of TCP/IP will be 
   conducted Friday, 1 Oct 1982 from 12:00 to 16:00 EDT, during which 
   time NCP will be disabled in the IMPS.  Those hosts which have not 
   implemented TCP/IP will not be able to communicate via the ARPANET 
   during the test period.

   Will those of you participating in this bakeoff please report 
   problems or useful observations to POSTEL@ISIF with cc: to the NOC 
   (JGORDON@BBN-UNIX) and the NIC (NIC@SRI-NIC)

   If you have NOT implemented TCP/IP, the end of the world is near!
         ***** 1 Jan 1983 is the cutover date, folks! *****
   

SMTP MUST BE IMPLEMENTED BY 1 JAN 1983

   SMTP will become the official network mail protocol.  All hosts with 
   mail service should plan on implementing SMTP by 1 Jan. 1983 for 
   sending and receiving network mail.  SMTP is completely separate from
   FTP, and is handled by a distinct server.  This is quite different in
   detail from the current mail-handling procedures.  Questions about 
   implementation of the mail protocol should be addressed to Jon Postel
   (POSTEL@ISIF).

   In addition, all hosts must be able to understand the 4-octet host 
   addressing scheme outlined in RFC-796 and RFC-810.
   

DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE ONLINE FROM NIC

   The documents you will need, if you do not already have them, are the
   following:

   1. The Internet Protocol Transition Workbook (IPTW).

      Most of you have this volume which contains many of the needed 
      protocols.  However, new versions of SMTP and other mail-related 
      protocols have been issued since this book was published.  
      References to the updated mail protocols are listed below and are 
      available online at the NIC.  If you do not have the IPTW, copies 
      may be obtained from the NIC (NIC@SRI-NIC).

      The IPTW contains TCP/IP/UDP/ICMP, the application level 
      protocols, discussion of the address mappings and host table 
      specification, and related information.

   2. RFC-821 - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (68 pp)
      (Note:  This is a new version that obsoletes RFC-788 contained
      in the IPTW.  Pathname = [SRI-NIC]<Netinfo>RFC821.txt)

   3. RFC-822 - Standard for the Format of ARPA Internet Text Messages
      (47 pages)  (Note:  This is a new version that obsoletes RFC-733
      contained in the IPTW.  Pathname = [SRI-NIC]<Netinfo>RFC822.txt)

   4. RFC-819 - The Domain Naming Convention for Internet User
      Applications (18 pp).  Pathname = [SRI-NIC]<Netinfo>RFC819.txt)

   5. Internet Protocol Implementor's Guide - This document gives an
      overview of the protocols and some general implementation
      guidelines.  Copies have been sent to everyone who has a copy
      of the IPTW and should be arriving soon.  This document is not
      necessary to the implementation of the protocols, but is very
      useful.  Additional copies are available from NIC@SRI-NIC.
   

   Changes are taking place rapidly.  We will try to keep you informed 
   of events and necessary documentation (new or updated) via this 
   newsletter.  Please see that implementors at your site are added to 
   the Network Newsletter distribution list (ANEWS) by sending a request
   to NIC@SRI-NIC, or otherwise see that they are notified of 
   newsletters as they are published.

   Documents online at the NIC can be obtained via FTP from your local 
   host using username 'anonymous' and pw=guest.

TCP IMPLEMENTATION SURVEY BEING CONDUCTED

   The NIC is conducting a survey on behalf of DCA, of who has TCP/IP 
   and related software implementations and products.  Questionnaires 
   have been included in the current mailing of the Internet Protocol 
   Implementation Guide.  A copy of the questionnaire is also online at 
   SRI-NIC (10.0.0.73) as file <NETINFO>TCP-QUESTIONNAIRE.TXT if you 
   prefer to submit the information online.  Return completed 
   questionnaires to NIC@SRI-NIC or to E. Feinler, SRI International, 
   Room EJ221, 333 Ravenswood Ave., Menlo Park, CA, 94025.

   If you have promotional or descriptive literature for any of the 
   implementations or products, please send copies to the NIC for 
   reference, and keep us on your mailing list for future announcements,
   advertising, or descriptive brochures.
