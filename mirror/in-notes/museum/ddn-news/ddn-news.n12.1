DCA REORGANIZES

   DCA is being reorganized to carry out the DoD decision to cancel 
   AUTODIN II in favor of an ARPANET-based system, known as the Defense 
   Data Network (DDN).  As part of this reorganization, the ARPANET 
   Management Branch has become a part of the DDN Program Managers 
   Staff.  This action has been taken to insure that actions to 
   implement the DDN will have minimum impact upon services to ARPANET 
   users.  As a result, Code 252 is now Code B645.  Messages addressed 
   to DCACODE252 at USC-ISI will continue to reach us.
   
CHANGES TO PROCEDURES FOR SUBMISSION OF TIP INVENTORY REPORT

   The following changes have been made in the procedures for submission
   of the TIP Inventory Report:
   
   1.  SUBMISSION OF REPORTS:  Reports are to be submitted to a new 
   address: TACSTATRPT@BBNB.  Previous addressees (i.e., NIC@NIC, 
   Huntley@SRI-NIC, etc.) should no longer be cc:ed.  Reports are to be 
   submitted during the first week of each quarter, i.e., the first week
   of January, April, July, and October.  Each quarterly report should 
   be complete within itself, even though the information is unchanged 
   from the previous quarterly report.
   
   2.  FORMAT CHANGES:  Facilities will be identified both by name and 
   address, e.g. DCEC-TIP, 2/20. Under the column heading, "TYPE", use 
   the following codes to indicate the type of port:
      H = Hard wired
      D = Dial-up.
   Other codes may be used in addition to these if needed; however, such
   other codes as are used must be explained at the bottom of the 
   report.
   
C\30 UPGRADE

   Most sites have already placed their orders with BBN for C\30 
   equipment to replace the older Honeywell H316 and H516, and BBN 
   Pluribus nodes on the ARPANET.  There are still a few stragglers, 
   however, who have not yet placed their orders.  Although we can 
   understand the budgetary constraints which some of you are under, we 
   cannot allow the Network as a whole to suffer as a result of a few. 
   Some have wondered what will happen if a given node has not been 
   upgraded by the January 83 deadline.  Such nodes will, of necessity, 
   be reconfigured out of the network for the benefit of those who have 
   upgraded.  We regret this necessity, but will have no choice in the 
   matter.
   
   Sincerely,
   
   Major Glynn Parker
   DCA Code B645
