Section I. OFFICIAL

              Topic: - IDENTIFYING DIRECTLY-CONNECTED TAC USERS

----------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: The following requirement is not addressed to Tech Liaison or to
Host Administrators, but to individual, direct-connected (not dial-up)
TAC users.  It will be placed in  the TAC News Server  as one means of
getting it to  the intended  recipients.  Hosts are also requested  to
make it available to  account holders  on their machines via  bulletin
boards, or such  other means  as are feasible.  IMPORTANT:  This is  a
completely separate requirement from the TACACS registration drive now
underway.


        IDENTIFICATION OF DIRECTLY CONNECTED TAC USERS REQUIRED

All directly connected (dedicated)  users of TACs are asked to provide
the  following  information  to  the  Defense  Data  Network   Program
Management Office (DDN-PMO)  not later than  16 Dec 1983.  Information
should be sent by  electronic mail to gpark@ddn1.  (If the sender does
not have access to an electronic mail system,  the information may  be
sent instead to HQ  DCA Code B627, Washington, DC 20305,  ATTN:  Major
Parker).  This  information  is necessary  in  order to  complete  the
physical split of the  MILNET/ARPANET  backbone, AND IS IN ADDITION TO
THAT WHICH  IS REQUIRED  FOR THE  TACACS REGISTRATION.   Because  of a
shortage of TAC ports to serve new requirements, and/or as a result of
long lead times for obtaining circuits if rehoming is required,  users
who remain unidentified beyond the date requested above may be subject
to interruption  of network  service.   The following  information  is
required.  INSTRUCTIONS FOR EACH ITEM ARE GIVEN BELOW.


   1. Name of principle user/phone/U.S. mail address: 

   2. Terminal Location:

   3. Circuit Number and description:

   4. Organization: 

   5. DoD affiliation: 

   6. TAC used: 

   7. TAC Port: 

   8. Primary electronic mailbox address: 

INSTRUCTIONS: 

   1.  If more than one person uses the terminal, enter name of person
who is primarily responsible for the terminal.  Person listed will  be
used as Point of Contact for circuit actions if  rehoming is required.

   2. Provide  the physical  location of  the terminal.  Include  room
number, bldg number, street address, etc.

   3.  The circuit number  may be obtained  from your local  telephone
company.  Circuit description should include line speed,  modem types,
and other communications equipment, if any.

   4.  Enter the  specific, local organization of the principle  user.
If military, this would  be Squadron, Company,  etc.  If Contractor or
University, give the comparable local organization.

   5.  For military  organizations,  enter  the  name  of  the  parent
Service.  For Contractors  or Universities, enter  that branch of  the
DoD which  sponsors your  participation in  the network.  For  non-DoD
agencies such as DOE,  enter the corresponding  non-DoD branch of  the
government.

   6. The name of the TAC is included in the TAC herald.

   7.  The TAC port to which you are connected is also included in the
TAC herald.

   8.  E.g., gpark@DDN1.  This information  will enable us to determine
whether it is necessary to rehome your terminal to a different TAC than
the one to which your are currently homed.

Any questions pertaining to this requirement may be addressed to Major
Glynn Parker,  DCA Code  B627, (gpark@ddn1),  (703) 285-5133  or  (AV)
356-5133.
