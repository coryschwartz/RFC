A new Request for Comments is now available in the online RFC
libraries.

Note: This is a PostScript RFC, a secondary version is available in
ASCII.  The secondary ASCII version may lack figures and the
information encoded in typographic variation (italics, boldface,
etc.).  Since this information often provides essential context, the
ASCII version is at best incomplete and at worst misleading.  Anyone
expecting to understand this document is strongly encouraged to obtain
the PostScript version.
