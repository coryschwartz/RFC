                   Where and how to get RTRs
                   =========================

Some RARE Technical Reports (RTRs) are also published as subset of the
RFCs.  Once you know the RFC number of the document describing an RTR
you may obtain that document by getting the RFC.  RFCs may be obtained
from http://www.rfc-editor.org/, or from many other mirror sites around
the world.

For convenience the RTR document that were RFCs are also grouped and
listed by their RTR numbers, and these may be obtained via EMAIL or FTP
from RTR Repositories.

Many of these repositories also now have World Wide Web servers. Try
the following URL as a starting point to locate these servers.

                http://www.rfc-editor.org/

In particular, they can be obtained from the RFC Editor Web site
as follows.

1.  Via Anonymous FTP

RTRs are available via anonymous FTP from FTP.ISI.EDU, with the
pathname: in-notes/rtr/rtrNN.txt (where "NN" is the number of the RTR).

For example rtr8.txt is titled "Network Access to Multimedia
Information".  Login with FTP username "anonymous" and password "ftp".

2. Via Email

RTRs can also be obtained via electronic mail to "rfc-info@isi.edu"
with a message body of:

	 Retrieve: RTR
	   Doc-ID: RTRnnnn

(Here "nnnn" refers to the number of the RTR; always use 4 digits, so
RTR 6 is RTR0006 in the RFC-INFO service).

The RFC-INFO@ISI.EDU server provides other ways of selecting RTRs based
on date ranges and such; for more information send a message to
"rfc-info@isi.edu" with the message body "help: help".

Note that RTRs may be very large (greater than 100,000 characters), the
RFC-INFO service will return large documents in sections of less than
50,000 characters each.
