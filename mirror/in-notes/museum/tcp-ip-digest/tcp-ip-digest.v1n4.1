Subject:  Administrative Notes

For those of you who have trouble remembering where the list originates from,
I have (with the graceous help of JSol) added mail reflectors for TCP-IP and
TCP-IP-REQUEST on both AI and MC.

People wishing to get back issues can now FTP them from Utah-20 (see letter
below), or they can write to TCP-IP-REQUEST.  Again, I regret our inability
to allow anonymous logins.  If there is a high demand for back issues, other
archive sites may be set up.

Subject: Online Archive

We are keeping an online archive, of at least recent stuff.  Will probably
archive it (to tape) after it gets old, whatever that means (probably a
function of disk space and interest and list content).  Anyway, people are
welcome to ftp it from here-- it's <bboard>tcp-ip.txt, in chronological
order, MM format.

Subject: PUP

PUP stands for Parc Universal Packet.  It is the network architecture
used in the Xerox internet for several years, which has several hundred
computers on various kinds of networks throughout the world.  A good
overview is in April 1980 IEEE Transactions on Communication.  To
summarize its features, it is a datagram-based very simple family of
protocols, from which IP borrows many of its ideas.  Because it was one
of the first working "network architectures," there are some
unresolvable problems, like limited address space.  Stanford did Unix
implementations of PUP because we got all sorts of equipment from Xerox
that used it.  Ethernet has always supported multiple "network-level"
protocols, so there is no problem encapsulating IP at the same time.

Does that clear up some confusion?

If anyone is interested in more detail concerning the problems with
TOPS-20 TCP/IP, I wrote a long-winded document about said topic.
It needs some polishing up to reflect feedback from the people who
did the work, but if there's enough interest (how do we gauge it?)
I'll make it available.

Mark Crispin hit on some of the high points, but if you're a TOPS-20
type and are worried about what TCP is going to mean to you if DEC
continues its current course, then it should be useful.

I can only second Mark's prediction that this current BBN/DEC TOPS-20
implementation is going to be basically useless because of its poor
performance.  There is some hope that there is something grossly wrong
with it that can be tuned away, but we're grasping at straws.  Does
anyone at ISI involved in looking at this implementation have any new
data?

Subject: Suggestions to make the NCP ==> TCP Transition happen.
From: the tty of Geoffrey S. Goodfellow
Reply-To: Geoff at SRI-CSL

Here are some suggestions to help/force people implement TCP/IP
by "the deadline", Jan 1, '83:

1) Removal of NCP from TIPS -- When your out of town and away
from your host, and can't login to read your mail, you'll want to
have it implemented.

2) When your Principle Investigator (i.e.  high level bureaucrat)
can't send mail to other hosts which only support TCP or login
remotely from a TIP, you'll want to have TCP/IP implemented.

3) I believe it is DARPA's intention to put AS MANY services as
possible onto the Internet (i.e.  only accessable via TCP/IP)
that users will REALLY WANT to implement the Internet Protocols
in order to have access to them.  It might be nice for a
"Directory Of Services" (like the VAN-Gateway for example) to be
published to show availalbe Internet services.  [I guess this
would be the current ARPANET RESOURCES HANDBOOK covering the
entire Internet as opposed to just ARPANET Resources, and perhaps
becoming the INTERNET RESOURCES HANDBOOK?]

and lastly (this one is my favorite), 4) Have such hosts as the
various ISI-* systems, where most of the Network Sponsors have
their mailboxs who provide many a funded $$$ to us all,
de-install NCP on the transition date.  Therefore, causing anyone
who has *NOT* impelemented Internet by that time, be unable to
communicate with their Sponsor, and hence, they won't get funded.

MIKE,
RECENTLY I SENT YOU A NOTE WHICH
YOU PUBLISHED AS PART OF YOUR NEWSLETTER.

WHEN I SAW THE NOTE, I REALIZED THERE
MIGHT BE SOME CONFUSION CAUSED BY THE
FACT THAT IT WAS SENT FROM MY SECRETARY'S
MAILBOX (DUCKETT@ISIE) AND NOT FROM
MINE (CERF@ISIA). JUST WANTED TO
ALERT YOU TO THIS (AND YOUR READERS).

THE ODDLY FORMATTED MESSAGE BEFORE YOU
COMES FROM AN APPLE COMPUTER WITH
SMALL DISPLAY SCREEN (15 USABLE LINES)
AND 40 CHARACTERS ACROSS AND UPPER CASE
ONLY. THE ONLY SAVING GRACE IS THAT
THE COLOR GRAPHICS AND SHOOTING 
GALLERY GAMES LOOK GOOD IN COLOR...

Subject: Re:  REM's gripes about internet mail

I found REM's comments interesting but not very well based in reality.
First note that the internet mail standard is essentially
	"user.host@network"
where user, host, and network are character strings.  There is no
assumption that the "host@network" pair can be mapped into a pair
of integers from some table somewhere, unless you actually intend
to send packets and simulate things like telnet.  Of course, for
sending mail you don't need this.

PCnet is not the only network that provides el-cheapo service at
el-cheapo prices (e.g. over dialup telephone lines).  The UUCP net
has been around for some years and does this (with no internal
numbering of hosts) and the new CSNET PhoneNet is the same idea.

Only the network has to be able to translate "host" into enough
information to route the message there, not the whole internet.  This
requires ONE SITE on each network to keep an up to date list of sites
and routes.  Other sites have the option of sending the mail to the
smart site to forward.  The alternative to this is what UUCP does now:
you explicitly route messages through all the hosts that forward the
message, e.g. decvax!duke!unc!smb@Berkeley gets forwarded through the
three UUCP sites decvax, duke, and unc to user smb.  The advantages to
this are (1) to add a site, all you have to do is inform its
neighbor(s) that it exists, and (2) the software doesn't have to worry
about routing.  The disadvantages are (1) it's a pain for people to
manually route stuff, and, more importantly, (2) your address varies
depending on the place the mail is sent from.  Thus the current custom
of specifying a UUCP address relative to a well known host such as
ucbvax or duke.  Not very pleasant.

If a net like PCnet wants to avoid keeping tables anywhere, all that's
necessary is to put info such as phone number and other connection info
in the host field.  (I don't recall a limit on how long these names
can be, although most implementations will probably assume one, so some
large upper limit ought to be documented.)  This makes even UUCP look
luxurious - you get to refer to a site by NAME! REM's latitude/longditude/telno
scheme seems kind of useless to me - within one square minute can often
be found a large number of computers.  Often they are on a switch front
end, so even the phone number is the same.  Maybe this will work for
personal home computers, but if everybody in a large office building has
their own personal computer...  In any case, it seems that such conventions
ought to be up to the individual network to specify, so long as they
fit the user.host@network syntax.

From: NIC at SRI-NIC
Subject: ANEWS-9
 
There is a new alternative host interface for the ARPANET C/30 IMPs
called HDH (HDLC Host).  This interface method is similar to the
existing VDH (Very Distant Host) interface in that it provides for
reliable transmission of messages between the host and its IMP over a
communication circuit of arbitrary length.  As with VDH, the HDH
interface can be used with communication circuits that range in speed
from 9.6KB to 56KB. 
 
HDH is superior to the VDH interface in that it uses as a reliable
transmission protocol the HDLC protocol which is the link level control
procedure of the CCITT international standard X.25.  HDLC is supported
by a much wider range of vendor equipment than the special ARPANET VDH
protocol.  It is also technically superior to VDH in that it provides
for a window of up to seven outstanding frames instead of the two
allowed by VDH, thus increasing the potential throughput.  The HDH
interface is also capable of accepting a full-length ARPANET host/IMP
message in a single frame, where VDH always requires fragmentation into
buffer-sized frames.
