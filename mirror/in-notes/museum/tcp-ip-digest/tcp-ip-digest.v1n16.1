The Universtiy of Maryland Computer Science Center is now implementing
TCP-IP for the Univac 11xx machines. Currently, they have an IP version
running with the DCNET local-network protocol and a TCP/TELNET user
interface. TCP itself is only partially complete at this time.

Further information can be obtained from Mike Petry (301) 454-2946.

There is a quote character in SMTP, the backslash "\".

[ The next two letters are a continuation of the discussion between Calvin
  George and Jon Postel started in V1#15, concerning FTP Commands and
  Replies.  They are published by permission.  -Mike ]

From: GEORGE at AFSC-HQ
Subject: ftp commands and replies

I am still concerned that there can be different interpretations of
RFC765 (your correction noted) concerning the changing of DEFAULT
port numbers. The scenario on page 41 of RFC765 concerns 3rd party
transfers. I appreciate the need for the PASV command and 227 reply
for 3rd party transfers. In the case of 2 party transfers, I see no
requirement (in the protocol specification) for the USER to issue
a PASV command to the SERVER, so that the SERVER might have the 
opportunity to specify a different port for the data connection. 
By using DEFAULT ports, defined for FTP, it appears to me there is
less network overhead establishing connections. I also cannot see
that requiring the SERVER to use the DEFAULT port places any undue
restrictions on the SERVER, given the way TCP defines a session.
 
My real concern is:  Given we (SAMNET) convert our FTP assuming there is
no requirement to issue the PASV command (for 2 party xfers) and the 
UNIX and TOPS20 implementors convert their FTP such that they expect
a PASV so they can REPLY with their intended data port-- our current
problem may well follow us to TCP.
 
Could it be that I do not understand RFC765 or is there some ambiguity
in this area?

Calvin:

I think your concern about two-party transfers and the potential for
deadlock between a default-only data connection implementation and
a non-default-only data connection implementation can be put to rest.
The RFC 765 rules require that every implementation operate with the
default ports, and that only the user can initiate a change from the
defaults.

I will put  a note in my master copy of the RFC to add a paragraph
on page 15 and on page 40 stating this very clearly.

Subject: Network suggestions solicited

We would like some advice from the networking community out there in
TCP-IP land.

The Microelectronics Center of North Carolina (MCNC) is in the process of
setting up a network to connect the various universities and other
institutions that are participants.  We would welcome any suggestions
about hardware, software, etc., given the rather varied machines to be
connected.

Configuraton:

	At MCNC itself are two VAX 11/780s running 4.1BSD UNIX.
	Currently, there are 9600 baud leased lines to each of the
	participating institutions (PIs); these lines are used for
	8-line statistical multiplexors.  We are considering high-speed
	microwave links to fully interconnect all of the PIs, and would
	prefer software that would remain usable.

	UNC has two VAX 11/780s running 4.1BSD, an 11/45 running v7
	UNIX, and another 11/45 which will probably run 2.8BSD.  The
	first three machines are in the same room, and are connected by
	Able Interlinks; the fourth is across the street, and will
	probably be connected via either an DMR11 over a coax cable, or
	a 9600 baud asynch line.  They are linked by uucp and Purdue EE
	net connections.

	Duke has an 11/70 running v7, as well as several smaller 11s.

	UNC-Charlotte has a pair of 11/40s running v7.

	NCSU has several VAX 11/780s running VMS and (sometimes) Eunice;
	an 11/24 acts as a front-end for their terminals via DECnet.

	NC A&T will soon (imminently) have a VAX 11/780 running 4.1BSD.

	RTI has an 11/23; it's not clear what system they'll run on it yet.
	V7 and XENIX are two possiblities.

	There are plans to get a large number of single-user
	workstations; these will also need to be tied in to the net.
	And we'll probably need the ability to talk to IBM systems
	running MVS and/or VM, and probably other machines as well.

We need mail service, remote logins, and both spooled and real-time
file transfer.  Some of these files will be quite large.  We currently
use uucp, but it isn't sufficient.

Now -- if you had all that hardware, what would *you* do?
