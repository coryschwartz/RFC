Subject: Administrivia

Well, the source of the leak to ComputerWorld has been found, so that
we have some breathing space to mull over the implications (it was an
ArpaNet recipient, so USENET sites need not worry).  It is certainly
clear that anything that goes out in a Digest will reach a large audience,
not all of whom are involved with the ArpaNet (USENET, for example).  At
some time, material WILL fall into "outside" hands.  The question becomes
a choice between:

    1)  Being more careful, so that anything said is quotable, or
    2)  Publishing a "restricted rights" notice on the top of the digest
	as a deterent to re-publication.

Under no circumstances do I want to restrict the membership or distribution
of this Digest.  I hope that we can get over these political problems, and
get back to discussing technical issues once again.
					Thoughts?

Subject: use of .

Why not use ! instead of . for routing in network addresses.
It seems a much wiser choice.

From: cak at PURDUE
Subject: Overloading .

Many other systems use . as a separator; PhoneNet for CSNET uses it
as in cak.purdue@udel, the Berkeley local network can use it, as in
csvax.cak, PUP uses it, as in clark.WBST@Parc-Maxc, ad nauseum....

[ I believe that the CSNET usage of User.Host@Forwarder is the RFC733
  approved addressing format for sites which can't take User@Host@Forwarder.
  The choice of the dot does seem rather unfortunate.  The British have
  adopted RF733 for their mail standard, but selected the percentage symbol
  "%" rather than the dot ".".  -Mike ]

Subject: TCP-IP implementations
From: AVRUNIN at USC-ECLB

In implementing TCP-IP in various computer systems it would be helpful
to have an implementation to start with.  There seems to be severaly "C"
versions.  I would like to know what other languages have
been used for implementations.  I would especially like to know if anyone
has or is using Fortran 77 for implementation.

Thanks

  written in RATFOR (Rational FORTRAN).  -Mike ]

Would claiming a common law copyright on this digest stop ComputerWorld
from printing quotes?

------------------------------

From: Geoffrey H. Cooper <GEOF at MIT-XX>
Subject: Re:   TCP-IP Digest, Vol 1 #10

    If there is really a concern about having TCP-IP entries published
on paper-based media, it would help some to put a copyright notice on
each digest:
	(C) Copyright 1982, DARPA, all rights reserved.  The material
	    in this digest may not be copied, in whole or in part, for
	    purposes of commercial publication without the written
	    permission of the moderator.  Individual sections of the digest
	    may contain copyright notices which supercede this notice.
This would at least make editors of computerworld and the like hesitate if
given the entire digest.

Subject: TCP digest as a public forum

I just want to make sure the people on this list are aware that each
TCP digest is fed into USENET on newsgroup fa.tcp-ip.  This is sent to
(currently) about 120 machines across the US and Canada.  (For those
who don't know about USENET, it's a distributed bulletin board system.)
USENET specifically has a policy that anything posted to net and fa
newsgroups is public information that can be redistributed to whoever
wants it.  The point is that if you have anything you consider secret,
it probably shouldn't be mailed to the list.

While I am under the impression that this policy is consistent with the
intent of the TCP-IP digest, if I'm wrong, it may be necessary to
remove the USENET feed from the mailing list.

It is possible that ComputerWorld got their information from USENET,
but from the wording of the article, they seem to have gotten it from
somewhere on the Arpanet.

It is easy to confuse private mail and public mailing lists/newsgroups,
and it seems clear that the quote from the digest was written in a
"I'm talking privately to friends" frame of mind.  Clearly he didn't
intend his words to be printed in ComputerWorld.  But it is important
to remember that anything which is mass-mailed is effectively published.

Mike,

Following is an extract of a recent report on the status of our
IP/TCP implementation which may be of interest to your readers.

The COMSAT IP/TCP implementation, which was sponsored by DARPA,
was developed over the last three years and used extensively for
testing, evaluation and experimentation with other
implementations. This implementation runs in a sizable number of
PDP11s and LSI-11s with varying configurations and applications.
It consists of a package of MACRO-11 modules structured into
levels corresponding to local-net, IP and TCP levels, with user
interfaces at each level. It is designed to be incorporated
either into a special operating system built for a multi-media
internet workstation (so-called "fuzzball," based on RT-11
emulation) or into the RSX-11 operating system as part of a
package to support the INTELPOST electronic-mail network.

The local-net level supports several comunication devices,
including synchronous and asynchronous serial lines, 16-bit
parallel links and 1822 interfaces. Hosts using this package have
been connected to ARPANET IMPs, Satellite IMPs, internet
gateways, port expanders and to the DCNET local network. It
provides optional automatic routing, time synchronization and
error-reporting functions. The IP level conforms to the RFC-791
specification, including fragmentation, reassembly, extended
addressing and options, but currently does not interpret options.
A full set of ICMP features compatible with RFC-792 is available,
including destination-unreachable, timestamp, redirect and
source-quench messages. Support for an IEN-142 compatible time
server and an IEN-109 (as amended) compatible internet gateway
can be included on an optional basis. The internet-gateway
support can be configured to include hierarchically structured
gateways and subnets. Destination-unreachable and source-quench
information is conveyed to the user level via the TCP and
raw-datagram protocol modules.

The TCP level conforms to the RFC-793 specification, including
PUSH, URGENT and options, but currently does not interpret
options. Its structure is based on circular buffers for
reassembly and retransmission, with repacketizing on each
retransmission. Retransmission timeouts are dynamically
determined using measured roundtrip delays, as adjusted for
backoff. Data flow into the network is controlled by measured
network bandwidth, as adjusted by source-quench information.
Features are included to avoid excessive packet fragmentation and
retransmission into zero windows. The user interface level
provides error and URGENT notification, as well as a means to set
outgoing IP/TCP options.

A raw-datagram interface is available for XNET (IEN-158), UDP
(RFC-768) and similar protocols. It includes internal congestion
and fairness controls, multiple-connection management and
timestamping. A number of user-level protocol modules have been
built and tested with other internet hosts, including user/server
TELNET (RFC-764) user/server FTP (RFC-765), user/server MTP
(RFC-780) and various utility file-transfer, debugging and
control/monitoring protocols.

Code sizes and speeds depend greatly on the system configuration
and features selected. A typical 30K-word LSI-11/2 single-user
configuration with all features selected and including the
operating system, device drivers and all buffers and control
blocks, leaves about 16K words for user-level application
programs and protocol modules. A typical 124K-word LSI-11/23
configuration provides the same service to a half-dozen
individually relocated users. Disk-to-disk FTP transfers across a
DMA interprocessor link between LSI-11/23s operate in the range
20-30 Kbps with 576-octet packets. The 124K-word PDP11/34
INTELPOST adaptation supports two 56-Kbps lines and a number of
lower-speed lines.

Further information is available from D. Mills (Mills@ISIE) on
the IP/TCP implementation and D. Jupin (Jupin@ISIE) on the RSX-11
adaptation.

Regards,
Dave Mills
