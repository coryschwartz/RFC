Subject: Special Issue on TOPS-20/TENEX TCP/IP Implementations, and Pinging

This issue is entirely devoted to discussion of the TOPS-20/TENEX
IP routing mechanism, which uses InterNet Control Message Protocol "Echo"
(ICMP/ECHO) packets to determine the Up/Down status of various Gateways.
(I have removed most of the lengthy message headers to improve readability).

Subject: TCP & Gateway Pinging

In the course of studying the long delays and other problems experienced
by users of the TYMSHARE-[IMP]43 Office machines 1,2,3, and 7, some
undesirable aspects of the TCP implementation at TYMSHARE were
uncovered.  We have not yet examined the rest of the IMPs on the ARPANET
to determine if other hosts are suffering from the same disease, but
have reason to suspect TENEX and TOPS-20 TCP implementations.

TYMSHARE's TCP running on OFFICE-1 and OFFICE-2 had built into it a
clumsy approach to maintaining a table on the status of internet
gateways.  Generally it is unnecessary to communicate with a gateway
unless one has traffic destined for that gateway, however, both hosts
were regularly "pinging", or exchanging single messages, with each of 23
gateways, at the interval of 37 seconds.  This is unnecessary for
TYMSHARE as none of its users accesses the ARPANET through a gateway.
It also may have contributed some of the degradation of service that
they have observed.  This last point has not yet been demonstrated, but
as I explain below, there is good reason to suspect this.

Here is the scenario.  TYMSHARE-43 is a C/30 IMP running 4305.  This
provides for 56 end-to-end connections.  TYMSHARE has 4 real hosts
which, during one of my 5-minute measurements, sent substantial numbers
of messages to 15 different hosts on the ARPANET.  However, as their
implementation of TCP, combined with its interaction with 1822, uses the
handling type field, each of these logical connections may result in
several subnetwork connections.  (This results from a misinterpretation
of the implementation specifications in BBN Report 1822 on the
interconnection of a host and IMP.  We are presently considering what
the right policy on this matter should be.  Handling type should
generally be set to zero.  If messages are submitted on a single
host-to-host connection with different handling types then a separate
connection will be set up for each type.  We have observed as many as 5
different subnetwork connections between a pair of hosts.  This is
undesirable for two reasons.  First, since messages in the same stream
will be sent on different connections, the IMPs will not deliver them in
order so that the TCP will have to reorder them; messages on the same
connection are always delivered in correct order.  Second, having more
connections open drains the resources of the IMP.  This can be quite
serious, as I explain below.  Furthermore, it is not at all clear that
there are any benefits to maintaining multiple connections.)

Here's the problem.  Two of the hosts on TYMSHARE-43 ping each of the 23
gateways every 37 seconds.  (CUMSTATS, after much scrutiny, exposed
this.) These possibly also have variable handling type.  Thus this
configuration can easily consume the available connection resources in
the IMP which means that each time either of the hosts pings a gateway
it will probably need to set up a new connection.  (EESTATS over a
1-hour period showed that the IMP was resetting its transmit blocks once
every 1.07 seconds, on average.)

Assuming a new connection is required for each ICMP ping of a gateway,
then each host is blocked every 37/23 = 1.6 seconds for as long as it
takes to set up a connection.  (When the ping message is submitted the
interface blocks until a message number is obtained.  Since there is no
existing connection a connection must be established before obtaining a
message number and queuing the message.) Measured round-trip times for
messages originating at TYMSHARE-43 (using CUMSTATS) range between 440
and over 600 ms, averaged over 1-hour periods.  Minute-by-minute
fluctuations presumably result in higher values at times.  If we assume
a 600 ms round-trip time then it takes at least 600 ms to set up a
connection to a gateway and dispatch the ping.  During this time nothing
else can be submitted to the net by that host.  Thus, using the above
values, the two host would each be blocked 600 ms out of each 1.6
seconds or almost 40 % of the time.  If the ICMP pings are bunched this
could lead to higher blockage rates for particular intervals.

This can have at least two adverse effects.  First, it will certainly
impact host throughput if its interface is blocked 40 % of the time on
useless persuits, at least from TYMSHARE's perspective.  Second, it
cannot be useful to the gateways to be pinged this often by however many
hosts on the ARPANET happen to be running this code.  (Incidentally, we
will soon run measurements to try to identify any other culprits.)

When I explained this all to Robert Lieberman at TYMSHARE he discovered,
via some software people at SRI, that the timer in the TCP code which
controlled this gateway pinging could be easily adjusted and since his
hosts do not talk to gateways he set the timer to 280 minutes,
effectively disabling the pinging so that we can observe the effect on
performance.  Our hope is that this will yield improved service for the
STLA-[IMP]61 users of TYMSHARE hosts.  Basically this approach to the
gateways is inadequate and must be replaced.  Just setting the timers is
not an adequate solution, although useful immediately.

It is not known if this contention for connections is degrading service
for other hosts on the network.  However, the mechanism explained above
may very well be impacting your network performance without being
obvious.  It happens, for example, that this mechanism does not produce
any kind of trap that would signal a problem to network operators
because, while the host may be blocked much of the time, it is not
blocked for an extended period e.g. 3 seconds.

I would appreciate hearing about any other cases, suspected or proven,
where connection contention causes degraded service.  Remember, the
ARPANET is NOT just a datagram network.

Subject: Re: TCP & Gateway Pinging

Steve,

	Thank you for your deductions on this.  I believe that you will
find all or most of the TOPS20 and TENEX sites on the network exhibiting
this behavior, since we are running variants of the same code.  However,
the pinging algorithim should be sufficiently similar in all the
implementations to exhibit the same bad manners.  The exceptions, as
far as I can see are those hosts who have edited entries out of their
gateway tables.

	As far as I know, 37 seconds is the standard inter-ping
interval.  From conversations with Dave Mills and Mike Brescia,
this interval is way too short, and results with the poor gateways
being flooded by probes at a high rate.  This congests them as well,
and hampers communications with other nets.  The value of PINGT0
in the monitor should be raised to a higher value.  We are currently
using about a 1 minute interval, and may raise that if the results
warrant it.

	There are many other things that the code may be doing
wrong, but more research is needed.

Subject: Warning, TCP-4 problems

This message is to make it clear that at least two problems exist in the
TOPS20, TENEX TCP code that is based on the BBN implementation.

1) The frequency of 'pinging' has caused excessive delays and heavy net
loads for our local IMP.  Our brief experiments show that whatever the
interval is, when the process wakes up and begins to 'ping' the several
gateways, all hell breaks loose and the host/imp are effectively down
until this process completes.  The most noticeable symptom is the sudden
slowness for a minute or so. However, the most annoying is the fact that
this process in some way (yet unknown) can disrupt the other connections
to our hosts with the result of user jobs that disconnect in funny ways
leaving 'hung' jobs on the host.  With a PING interval of 37 seconds (the
common standard), the situation is far worse.  We have gone the full way
and will just NOOP the entire process of pinging.  When a proper
solution is found, we will re-implement the pinging process.

2) This version of the BBN TCP code uses connections in an inefficient
manner as was stated by Steve Cohn.  Also we agree with Steve that this
code has a 'clumsy' approach to maintaining internet gateway data.

Since we run as vanilla as possible implementation of the TCP code to be
as compatible as possible with the TOPS20 sites, we will wait until
there is some general agreement on how to design the 'ping' process
before installing it.  Since BBN is not supporting this code, we will
continue to work closely with SRI, ISI, Stanford, etc. in solving these
common problems.

Subject: Re: Warning, TCP-4 problems

One suggestion -

     Do not run the NIC-supplied INTERNET.GATEWAYS file!!  This
is not made obvious to sites (I certainly was unaware of it), but
it is an important axiom.

     The problem is that the NIC gateways file has all the
gateways.  You really don't want all the gateways; instead, you
want a few "prime" gateways that are your primary contacts for IP
datagrams leaving ARPANET.  You probably also want a few other
selected "always-up" (these don't get pinged) and "dumb" gateways
(e.g. for nets you know you are going to talk to all the time).

     The reason you don't need all the gateways is that ICMP to
the prime gateways will take care of fixing up your routing table
to suit your needs dynamically as those needs happen.  ICMP is
always going to be better than any file the NIC could provide.

     I've talked to several individuals who've been involved with
this stuff for years, and they all concur: if you're on the East
coast, run BBN's INTERNET.GATEWAYS; if you're on the West coast,
run ISI's.  Otherwise, look at both and figure out for yourself
what looks best for your needs.  Use the NIC's only as a
reference source of gateways you might want to add.  Don't
actually run it.

Subject: Re: Warning, TCP-4 problems

It would help me (and I suspect also other people on this list) if
someone would describe in a bit more detail the method in which we hear
about gateways that are not listed in our internet.gateways file.  I
would like to be able to talk to any internet-addressable host.  I would
not like to spend all of my time pinging.  If I list only the prime
gateways, will I still be able to talk through any gateway?  If so, then
why does anyone list anything other than the prime gateways?  Also, a
previous message said that prime gateways are safe because they don't
get pinged.  It also implied, but did not say, that this was true of
DUMB gateways also.  Is it?  Would anything be gained if we listed all
of the gateways from the NIC file, but changed the ones that get pinged
(I am still not clear on which those are) to be listed as dumb?

All a host has to have is a short list of fairly reliable gateways.  The host
also keeps a dynamicly built table of (destination-network,gateway-to-use)
pairs.  When the host has oo send a datagram it first checks to see if the
destination network is in the dynamic table.  If it is then it uses the
indicated gateway.  If the destination network is not in the dynamic table,
then the host choose one of the gateways from the short list (randomly if
it wants) and makes a new entry in the dynamic table for that new pair.  If
a host sends a datagram to a destination network through the "wrong" gateway,
that gateway will (in addition to forwarding the datagram anyway) send back
to the host a  ICMP Redirect Control Message indicating the correct gateway.
The host on receiving an ICMP redirect message should update the dynamic
table entry to show the correct gateway for that destination network.  The
entries in the dynamic table should be aged and deleted after a fairly long
time (say, an hour). The entries should also be deleted at once if there if
is any indication that the gateway has died (e.g., an ARPANET 1822 "host dead"
is returned).

Subject: Of gateways and pinging
From: Joel Goldberger <JGoldberger@usc-isib>

Mark's comments on this subject are essentially correct, but it's clear
that there is some confusion.  PRIME gateways are a small subset of
gateways that engage in GGP (Gateway Gateway Protocol) amongst
themselves to maintain up to date routing tables.  At some interval they
announce to each other what networks they are connected to and how far
(in hops) they are from all networks that they know.  I'm not sure what
their known set of networks is.  The way things are supposed to work is
that if a host needs to talk to a particular network and doesn't know
the gateway to use it sends the message to any PRIME gateway.  If that
gateway knows of another gateway that is closer it sends an ICMP
re-direct packet back to the host.

TOPS-20 uses two different methods to PING gateways; PRIME gateways are
sent ICMP Echo packets, which they return as ICMP Echo Reply packets.
Dumb gateways (which don't speak ICMP) are PINGed with ICMP Echo-Reply
packets "reverse-addressed", that is the packet is addressed to the host
that is pinging; since the packet isn't for the gateway that received
it, it simply sends it back out.  ALWAYS-UP and HOST gateways are not
PINGed at all.  Since non-PRIME gateways don't get involved in the GGP
routing table update game one needs to include them in the tables if one
wants to talk to hosts on the network that they serve.

I hope this removes some of the mystery surrounding this subject.

  Recent measurements and messages indicate that a clarification
of the use and contents of the INTERNET.GATEWAYS file is needed and
that some TOPS20/TENEX hosts may still have a bug in their network
driver which is degrading network performance.  First, the bug:
The end of the IMPHDR routine (1822DV.MAC) should be:

	LOAD T3,NBBSZ,(T2)	; Get size
	SUBI T3,.NBHHL		; (Pseudo and real) header words
	ASH T3,2+3		; Make into bits
	CAILE T3,^D1008-1	; Uncontrolled flow must be single packet
	  MOVX T1,STY%FC	; Too big, must use Normal flow-controlled
	STOR T1,IHSTY,(T2)	; Message sub-type
	RET			; And return

If there is an		IDIVI T3,^D1008
			STOR T3,IHHTY,(T2)
please remove it.


  In theory, gateways do not have to be pinged;  a generic internet
gateway server whose internet logical name is coded into each host
could supply that host with the internet address of a gateway to use
(try) when the route to a destination network is not known.

   Until such a service is readily, reliably available, the TOPS20
and TENEX hosts use a site-dependent initialization file, named
INTERNET.GATEWAYS, to provide the address of a gateway to try when
the route to a destination is not known.  There is no need for a
host to know about all of the gateways;  the gateway system and
the ICMP protocol should make it possible for a host to reach any
"official" internet address, if it is at all possible.

  The INTERNET.GATEWAYS file should contain one or two (fairly
reliable) "PRIME" gateways on each network to which the TOPS20
or TENEX is directly connected.  Briefly, a PRIME gateway is
one of the "back-bone" gateways which knows now to route a packet
to one of the reachable networks, and will send ICMP redirect
messages when appropriate.  For reasons of performance (some of
which have been described in other messages), it is best if
sites do not all use the same gateway(s).  A "nearby" prime
gateway should be the first entry in the file, and a "backup"
should follow.  Entries should not be included simply because
the site has frequent communications with a particular net.

     One can make a reliability argument that the backup
     should be on the other side of the continent to try
     and minimize the possibility that both are down at
     the same time (due to a failure or maintenance).  A
     better solution (until the "gateway server" arrives)
     would be to have a backup file and to teach the
     operator(s) when and how to dynamically install it.

  Before one starts changing the values of the default network
parameters, make sure the consequences are well understood (and
please inform the operator what sorts of "performance problems"
the users may consequently report).  Most of the timeouts, etc.
are associated with robustness;  the longer the time constants,
the longer the associated outage will be when something fails.

   If a gateway listed in the routing cache goes down then
communication with the related network will not be possible
until the route is timed-out;  setting the timeout of the
routing cache to a large number can result in many problem
reports.  Setting it too short will cause packets to be sent
to the prime gateway more frequently.  [One recent incident:
"Users at B cannot communicate with Site D (anywhere else is
ok, though)" -- an ICMP redirect caused an entry to be placed
into the routing cache, and that gateway had subsequently
failed;  the routing cache was set to time out in six hours.
By the time the problem had been identified, there was only
one hour to go ...]

  If the ping interval is lengthened, the loss of a gateway will
not be noticed for a period about four times as long.  During the
interval, attempts to use the gateway (which are "hidden" from
the user) will fail.  If pinging is disabled, and the first prime
gateway listed in INTERNET.GATEWAYS goes down, the host will only
be able to communicate with directly connected networks and
networks which are still in the routing cache.

  If your host is only connected directly to the ARPANET, then
you need not read further.  Complications arise when the host
must be able to deal with "unofficial" entities -- hidden nets
or hosts, local area networks, home-brew gateways, etc.

  When the host tries to find a route to a network, it first checks
the routing cache.  If there is a functioning interface to the
desired network, it is used, secondly, if a <net,gateway> pair
is found, the gateway is used as the destination for the packet.
If no entry is found,
    [the gateways listed in INTERNET.GATEWAYS (which are "up")
    are examined (in the order specified in the INTERNET.GATEWAYS
    file) to see if one is listed as being able to reach the
    desired net, if so, it is used,  otherwise,]
the first PRIME gateway in the file (which is "up") will be tried.
If an ICMP Redirect Net message is received, the <net,gateway>
pair will be entered into the routing cache.

  The TOPS20/TENEX TCP-IP implementation is designed to operate in
the internet environment, not just the ARPANET;  in fact, it is not
necessary that the host even be connected to the ARPANET  (thus it
cannot rely on ARPANET/1822-specific mechanisms such as "host dead";
there is no corresponding mechanism in ethernet, for example).
The bracketed clause in the paragraph above is intended to allow a
site's liaison to both override the routing supplied by the internet
gateways (for administrative purposes, for example), and to allow
the host to use hidden or "unofficial" gateways, etc. between
networks with which the host must communicate, or which form the
site's local area network.  If such is not the case, there probably
should not be an entry in the gateway file;  if there is an entry
in the file (which isn't being pinged) and the gateway fails,
communications with the associated nets will be blocked.

  The following descriptions of non-PRIME gateways is included for
completeness, but use of such gateways is probably limited to sites
which have to communicate via local gateway implementations that do
not "conform to the official behavior" expected of a PRIME gateway.

PRIME gateways speak Internet Control Message Protocol, and will
turn an ICMP ECHO packet into an ECHO-REPLY;  they know how to
forward packets to reachable networks, and will send ICMP Redirect
messages when appropriate.  (E.g. the "backbone" gateways.)  They
are pinged to monitor when they are up and down.

DUMB gateways do not speak ICMP and thus will only forward packets.
These are pinged with ECHO-REPLIES instead of ECHO packets.

ALWAYS-UP gateways will not answer pings at all due to strange
implementations which, for example, prohibit reflecting packets
back into the net from which they came.  They are assumed to always
be up;  if they go down, you have a black hole.  (E.g. Two IMPs
on different networks which have ports which are wired together.)

HOST gateways are hosts which are capable of routing packets which
they receive;  they should not be burdened with forwarding packets
since they did not originate them, but they can be used in an
emergency.  (E.g.  TOPS20s [BBN or current DEC software] connected
to more than one (inter)network can be used to pass packets between
those (inter)networks.)

Hopefully, this has answered more questions than it raises;
if questions remain, send me a note.

2) IS there a program that anyone has that will printout the current
