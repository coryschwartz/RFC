Distribution of 2.8 BSD with TCP/IP.

Our port of the 4.1a BSD VAX networking code to the PDP11/44 or /70 is now
essentially complete.  We have been running the software on our SRI-PRMH
and SRI-WARF systems for about a month now with very good results.  The
local net drivers tested and running at this time are:  INTERLAN 10 megabit
ethernet, ACC LH-DH, and our locally built SRI1822.  Converting an existing
VAX network device driver to run with the 11 requires editing just a few
lines.  The DEC IMP11A driver has been converted but not yet tested.

I wish we had the time to make this distribution a really polished one, but
we don't.  We make the assumption that you already have installed 2.8 BSD
on your machine, and understand kernel configuration and debugging.  If you
brought up an early 2.8 distribution, I think you qualify.

To avoid licensing difficulties, we are restricting distribution to holders
of Berkeley UNIX licenses (x.x BSD).  Within a few months we hope that the
PDP11 group at Berkeley can take over and incorporate this distribution
into their next 2.82 release.  We are making this release available from
SRI due to the fast approaching ARPA TCP conversion deadline.  The tape we
can send you contains the new kernel, user level network code, and other
necessary tools (such as "cpp" from the VAX that understands long
identifier names).

Here is a copy of the entry recently submitted to SRI-NIC, for the
"tcp-ip-status.txt" document:

5. SRI UNIX 11/44,11/70  V7 (2.8 BSD)

   Date:  13 October 1982
   From:  Bill Croft <croft at sri-tsc>

   This TCP was ported from the Berkeley VAX 4.1a version.  IP, TCP, ICMP,
   UDP, and RAW layers are all kernel resident.  This means we can run
   faster than older PDP11 TCPs that require auxiliary daemons (such as
   BBN's V6 or 3COM's UNET).  Typical TCP interprocess thruput between a VAX
   750 running 4.1a BSD and the 11/44 running 2.8 BSD is 300000 baud;
   this was measured with INTERLAN 10 megabit ethernet hardware.

   For programmers, there is easy access to all layers of protocol, so
   that (e.g.) IP or UDP services can be written.  Service protocols
   available are all of those supplied with the VAX version:  FTP, TELNET,
   ECHO, rlogin, rsh, rexec, talk, routing daemons.

   1.  Hardware - currently requires an I/D machine, such as an 11/44
       or 11/70 with at least a half megabyte of memory.  The total kernel
       size (text, data, and buffers) is about 200K bytes;  so it won't
       fit if you have only 256K bytes.  Although this sounds like a lot
       of bytes, comparison with our older 2.8 BSD NCP-only system shows
       that the kernel has only grown by about 60K bytes.  This is very
       reasonable considering that the entire network is now resident
       versus the NCP case which used a hulking NCP daemon.

       A number of net interfaces are supported.  See the Berkeley VAX
       documentation.  The ones specifically ported to the 11 are:
       INTERLAN 10 megabit ethernet, ACC LH/DH, SRI 1822, DEC IMP11A.
       Porting a new VAX interface driver to the 11 involves changing
       less than 10 lines of code.

   2.  Software - ported from the 4.1a Berkeley VAX UNIX system.
       Manipulates I and D space mapping registers to reference more than
       65K bytes of instructions and data at a time.

   3.  Documentation - supplied on tape as manual pages.

   Contact for further information:  Dan Chernikoff, dan@sri-tsc, (415) 859
   4144.  We can mail a copy of our distribution tape.  Eventually the
   software will be incorporated in Berkeley's next PDP11 distribution
   (2.82 BSD).  This tape is supplied as-is to 2.8 BSD licenses, with no
   warrantees or support expressed or implied.  The terms of your original
   Berkeley license apply:  the software cannot be resold or redistributed.

To get the software, send a magnetic tape and a copy of your 2.8 or 4.x
license to:

	Dan Chernikoff
	SRI International
	333 Ravenswood Ave.
	Menlo Park, CA  94025

As far as updates and bug fixes go, this mailing list (ucbtcp11@sri-tsc)
can be used as a distribution point.  Send a note to dan@sri-tsc to
add or delete names from the list.

Subject: TCP/IP for VAX/VMS

This is to clarify a misconception that might be fostered by the note
from Y. Pin Foo in TCP-IP Digest #1:23.  Digital Technology Incorporated (DTI)
does indeed market software including TCP/IP under the name "ACCESS".
Our software is available for connection to the ARPANET via the ACC LH/DH-11.
It is also available in an Ethernet version using 3COM's Unibus Ethernet
interface.

The only 3COM software that we use is the device driver that is supplied
with the 3COM hardware.  All other software, including IP, TCP, TELNET,
FTP, and MAIL, was produced at DTI.

The first copy of the software package costs $15K.  Additional copies
to the same site cost $6K.

Am in the process of reading this "Xerox System Integration Standard",
and was wondering if anyone had thought about implementing this on top
of IP and/or TCP... and what progress you've made.

Subject: TCP-only throughput figures

Mike,

Vint Cerf suggested that you may be interested in including the
following figures in some form in the TCP-IP digest.  Basically,
they are a comparison of the number of packets going through the
net during the TCP-only test, as compared to the previous day
during the same time period.  They show that during the test, the
network had about 47% of the number of packets flowing as it did
during the previous day at the same time. 

You may want to include the figures as is, or you may want to
just present the totals.  I'll leave that up to you.

The line from DCEC to ETAM has come up for real.  DCEC gateway sees the
satnet, and also its satnet neighbors.  That ought to create real fun for
the gateway routing.

We expect to watch this for a while to make sure it settles in for good.

Subject: Results of DCEC Gateway Test
To: gateway-info at Bbn-Unix

Yesterdays test, which consisted of looping away the VDH line of the
BBN gateway, was very successfull.  All the traffic which normally
used the BBN gateway as a route between Satnet and the Arpanet was
redirected to the DCEC gateway.  I have included throughput data for
the period before and during the test, showing that the traffic
load switched to the DCEC gateway after the VDH line was looped.

[ Here is the correct throughput data for the DCEC gateway test.
  The first message included the data for the period before the
  test twice.  -Bob Hinden ]

Subject: VMS to UNIX software for DECNet

We are looking for a reliable and affordable software package that implements
a "DEC Net" interface between a UNIX host and a VMS host (both VAX computers).

The idea is that, if we must have UNIX as an ARPANET interface, we want to
be able to connect that host VAX to our other VAX computers, via DECNet.

Also, we have a VAX here at NWC that is running UNIX now; someday they may
want to join our NWCNet (LAN), via "DEC Net."

Do you know of such software?

If not, do you WANT to know about it? (i.e., If I go hunting, do you want
to be informed of my findings?)

Please reply to ESTELL at NWC-387B.

Thanks,

Subject:  TCP/IP &/or NCP for 3.0 UNIX

We are running UNIX 3.0 on an 11/70 and we're trying to get it running on the
net. We are currently using the CSNET as a gateway to Arpanet, but want
to get our system(s) directly into it.

We are looking at various places to get a reasonable NCP (short-term) and
TCP/IP (longer) that we can port over to 3.0. Is there anyone else out
there in UNIX-land who is trying to get to NCP and/or TCP/IP under these
circumstances?

Seems like you could get the Greep NCP front end that runs on VAXen
to work. But I'm not sure it would be worth the effort for a little
over two months of access.

As for TCP, you might want to look at the work that Bill Croft has
just completed. Are you tied to a 3.0 kernel? If not, you can
just put his up (it's based on 2.8bsd). Otherwise, you have some
work to do, but his code should be a good guideline.
