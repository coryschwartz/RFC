To: tcp-ip at BRL
     
     BBN has developed TCP/IP software for the HP3000 computer.  The
software runs under the MPE IV operation system on any of the HP3000
series computers.  In addition the basic TCP/IP software we also
have User and Server Telnet, User FTP,  A raw IP datagram user interface,
and a Name Server.  Yet to come is a Server FTP and an MTP mail program.
The software has been up and running on the ARPANET (bbn-hp host 2 on imp83).
for about 9 months and has taken a lot of pounding to shake out the bugs.  

     We use HP's INP (intelligent Network Processor) as an interface device
to connect to a C30 IMP.  The HP3000 uses HDH/HDLC protocols between the host
and the IMP.  These protocols are described in BBN report 1822 Appendix j.

Subject: CSNET's TCP/IP over X.25

     As part of the Purdue CSNET effort,  we  have  designed
and  implemented  software   to  send IP datagrams across an
X.25 network.  Essentially, our software layers TCP/IP  over
the   X.25   net  by managing  X.25  virtual circuits.  When
IP sends a datagram, our software first maps  the   Internet
address   into   an   equivalent  Telenet  address.  It then
checks to see if there is an open X.25  connection  (virtual
circuit)  to  the destination address, and uses it  if there
is one.  If none exists, the software opens one.  It  should
be  noted  that all traffic to a given host flows  over  one
X.25 virtual circuit.

     The software runs on Digital Equipment Corporation  VAX
computers  under  UNIX  (BSD  4.1) using an Interactive Sys-
tems Inc.  INcard-X25 device to handle X.25 levels 1-3.   It
uses  the  Gurwitz  implementation  of TCP/IP from BBN.  Our
software was demonstrated to  CSNET  project   personnel  on
June 15.  The demonstration consisted of sending files (FTP)
and  doing  remote  login  (TELNET) through TCP/IP, over the
GTE  Telenet  network between computers at Purdue University
in West Lafayette, Indiana and  the  University of Wisconsin
in Madison, Wisconsin.

(dec@purdue)  or Tim Korb (jtk@purdue), principal invesitga-
tors  on  the  Purdue  CSNET   contract,  or   Paul   McNabb

Subject:  Interlan Controller

We have gone into detailed analysis of the differences between 3Com and
Interlan. Basically the 3Com is cheaper and gives you less. This is
no problem if you are a stand-alone system (Indeed, we will probably
get 3Com for our SUNs) but on a Timeshare VAX it can be hell.
Let me illustrate:

o On a 3Com you have to carry the data from the SBI memory to the UNIBUS
  memory in has on its card. This is a big expensive loop of 16 bit
  word transfers, withi much unibus window turning. The Interlan board
  does cycle stealing to the SBI memory. No processor intervention needed.

o If a collision occurs on the 3Com, you have to go in and dump the
  queued output datagrams, if you don't you will not know who the next
  collision belongs to. You also have to do the backoff and retry in
  the driver at interrupt level. (you have to wait a precise number
  of microseconds). The Interlan does backoffs by itself.

o The 3Com driver does not allow you to cancel pending messages.
  If you hit ^C to stop a remote disk file transfer, you can't
  abort it.

o Don't Believe 3Com about collisions being very rare. Those measure
  ments were taken under fairly controlled enviroments by Shoch.
  There are other articles that point in other directions. Use
  your head and what you think your net environment will eventually
  look like when deciding if collisions are so rare.

If you are single user micro, none of this is any worry. So the
Interlan is no big win (and is more expensive). Look at what you
are going to use it for, and make your decision on this basis

To:  tcp-ip at BRL

Mike,

I've noticed lately that some, but not all, of the traffic I've been
receiving on multics (or perhaps its a function of where its sent from)
has been bearing Internet kinds of headers.  Presumably this means a) that
the net is gradually moving over to the Internet frame of mind, and
b) that this is being done in a way that ordinary users like me are
essentially transparent to and don't have to really think about.
If that is the case, it would be nice of someone to make a general statement
to the world at large reassuring us that although the transition to
TCP-IP may be a pain to all those who have to implement it, ordinary
people who just send and receive mail, and maybe even extending that
to FTP and TELNET, will so no change in their interfaces (unless they
start communicating beyond the ARPANET in whch case they'll have to at
least learn some extended form of addressing.)

Subject: Connecting DG machine to ARPAnet
To:   TCP-IP at BRL

I'm interested in connecting a Data General computer (MV 8000 most
likely, but could be an Eclipse or Nova also) to the ARPAnet.
In fact, I would like to create a gateway between a DG X.25
network and the ARPA TCP/IP network.  My options seem to be:

(1) Build a TCP/IP server for the 8000 from scratch.  Is anyone already
working on this?

(2) Port someone elses code, e.g., the RATFOR implementation from
Tektronix.  Is this really feasible?

(3) Put a dedicated gateway on both networks.  Does anyone know of
a reasonable candidate (e.g., some flavor of PDP-11), i.e., one that
already has one or both of TCP and X.25 implemented and that doesn't
cost too much?

Thanks for any and all answers to the above questions or any related
suggestions.

Subject: some questions about TCP-IP implementations
To: tcp-ip at BRL
Postal-Address: Sandia National Labs, Div 2644, Albuquerque, NM 87185
Telephone: (505) 844-6300, [FTS 844-6300, AUTOVON 244-6300]

Sandia is building a local net which may be connected to a soon-coming
DOE network which MAY use TCP-IP.  We have CDC (6600, 7600, and CYBER-xxx)
UNIVAC (1100/82), CRAY-1, and some DEC (PDP-11, VAX, DEC-20).  We are
taking time to reconsider some previous decisions about the protocol
on that local net (which must by the way deal with security issues).
We are going to put a FUJITSU (IBM look-alike) system on the net as 
file store.  The local network will use an NSC hyper channel.  We plan
to have one or more gateways to our distributed network (covering a few
square miles), and possibly the new DOE satelite network.

Now the questions:

1) Does TCP/IP seem reasonable for such a net.  (Most important use of
the local net will be file transfers from the CDC and CRAY systems to
and from the file store).

2) Are TCP/IP implementations available for CDC, CRAY, and IBM systems?

We are trying to make somewhat intelligent decisions rather quickly,
that we and our users may have to live with for years.  Honest answers
would be appreciated, whether pro or con.

Subject: TCP for TOPS-20
To: TCP-IP at BRL

I just wondered what the current status of TCP/IP for TOPS-20 is.  Last
I heard it suffered from performance problems and was not really suitable
for every day use.  I've also heard reports that BBN or DEC is trying to
fix it up to be more usable.  Who is supporting it and when will a good
implementation be available?

[ At the last InterNet meeting at BBN, BBN reported that they had
  improved the TOPS-20/TENEX greatly.  No idea when this will
  become availible, though.  -Mike]

To:   tcp-ip at BRL

Gentlemen:
It would appear that the optimal implementation for TCP/IP
would be in a linecard front end that could be tailored
to meet standard host interface protocols by 
firmware changes. Any VLSI work going on out there
on a optimized TCP/IP processor?

Subject: Re: S R Kleiman on Service Specifications (TCP-IP Digest, V1#20)
To: TCP-IP at BRL

I guess I don't understand how what you say can be true.  To take a
concrete example, when an X.25 package places a virtual call to
another X.25 machine, the packet level in the calling machine builds a
CALL REQUEST packet which it then gives to the link level for
forwarding.  The link level at the receiving machine passes the
corresponding INCOMING CALL packet up to the receiving packet level.
This much is the first two arrows of the four arrow model.

Now it may well be that the receiving packet level has to perform
time-consuming functions in order to decide whether to accept this
call .  While these functions are being performed, there is in fact no
flow control blockage at the LINK level; the link level continues to
service requests to/from the other logical channels of the packet
level.  However the particular logical channel that the call was
placed on is of course in a blocked state during Call Establishment
Phase; the caller is in state P2 (DTE waiting) and the callee is in
state P3 (DCE waiting).  Other logical channels are not affected by
this condition.  Finally, when the callee decides to accept or reject
the call, the logical channel in question goes to DATA TRANSFER or
CALL CLEARING state.  This is the second two arrows of the four arrow
model.  AT NO TIME is the link level ever in a flow control blocked
condition because of this.

Indeed, when the CALL REQUEST packet is passed to the link level of an
X.25 implementation, there is no reason for the link level to be aware
that this is a CALL REQUEST packet as opposed to, say, a DATA packet.
The link level has no reason to examine the content of these packets,
it merely forwards them to the corresponding link level at the other
end.  Hence the addition of FAST SELECT and DATAGRAM packets in the
1980 standard had no effect on the link level.

Now if we consider the effect of the three arrow model, the reply from
the callee indicates only that the call was received.  This is an
end-to-end flow control that is not provided by the link level
interface, whose flow control in X.25 indicates only that the frame
carrying the CALL REQUEST packet has been passed across the interface
to the link level in the network node.  Hence the acknowledgement
arrow in the three arrow model does provide some information, but not
much.  However in the four arrow model, when the packet level gets the
CALL ACCEPTED or CALL CLEARING packet indicating whether or not the
remote packet level accepted the call, there is considerable
information content in this packet.  Not only is a logical channel
open, but the flow control parameters and the throughput class and the
question of whether acknowledgments will be end-to-end have all been
resolved.

               DIRECTORS OF THE DEFENSE AGENCIES

SUBJECT:  DoD Policy on Standardization of Host-to-Host
          Protocols for Data Communications Networks

Reference:  (a)  USDR&E Memo, "Host-to-Host Protocols for Data
                 Communications Networks," 23 Dec 78 (IEN-152).

            (b)  DoD Standard Transmission Control Protocol
                 Specification, Jan 80 (IEN-129, RFC-761).

            (c)  DoD Standard Internet Protocol Specification, Jan 80
                 (IEN-128, RFC760).

            (d)  DoD Directive 4120.3, "Department of Defense
                 Standardization Program," 6 June 73

            (e)  DoDI 4120.20, "Development and use of Non-Government
                 Specifications and Standards," 28 Dec 76

1.  The purpose of this memorandum is to clarify DoD policy concerning
standardization of host-to-host protocols for data communications
networks .

2.  The policy cited in reference (a) is reaffirmed, namely:  (1) the
use of DoD standard host-to-host protocols (Transmission Control
Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP), references (b) and (c)) is
mandatory for all DoD packet-oriented data networks which have a
potential for host-to-host connectivity across network or subnetwork
boundaries; (2) the Director, Defense Communications Agency, is designated
as the Executive Agent for computer communications protocols; and (3)
case-by-case exceptions will be granted by the Executive Agent only for
networks shown to have no future requirements for interoperability.

3.  Reference (a) is not intented to replace the normal DoD
standardization procedures established by DoDD 4120.3 (reference (d)).
Rather, the Executive Agent Function is intended to place increased
emphasis and initiative on the important and currently volatile
technology of data communications protocol standardization.  New
standards and modifications to existing standards will be submitted by
the Executive Agent to the Defense Department components for
ratification aned dissemination in accordance with the provisions of
reference (d).

4.  DoDI 4120.20 (reference (e)) also continues to apply to protocol
standards.  Thus, it is desired that nongovernment protocol standards be
adopted and used in lieu of the development and promulgation of new
documents. Military requirements for interoperability, security,
reliability and survability are sufficiently pressing to have justified
the development and adoption of TCP and IP in the absence of
satisfactory nongovernment protocol standards.  In the future, the
Executive Agent will determine whenever unique military requirements
justify the development and adoption of unique DoD protocol standards
after making every effort to use prevailing nongovernment standards.
Moreover, the Executive Agent will make every effort to inject DoD
requirements into the nongovernment standard development process through
participation in voluntary standards forums and through coordination
with other U.S. Government members of such forums.  This influence
should be exerted with the objectives of both avoiding the need to
develop and adopt unique DoD standards and enabling eventual replacement
of unique DoD standards with functionally equivalent nongovernment
standards.
