Folks -

	It looks like somebody on this list is feeding copies of the TCP/IP
Digest to ComputerWorld magazine, which seems delighted with this
newfound source of "inside" information.  While it is my intention that
this list receive as broad a distribution as possible, several
tightropes must be carefully traversed:

	Networking plays a vital part in the Mission of the Ballistic Research
Laboratory (BRL), which fully supports the distribution of the TCP/IP
Digest.  However, the ArpaNet is intended for U.S. Government business,
and is not supposed to compete with commercial packet networks.  This
has a rather limiting effect on the group of people who can freely use
the ArpaNet.

	More importantly, though, is a question of content.  If it becomes
known that contributions to the TCP/IP Digest will appear in ComputerWorld,
possibly verbatim, or perhaps cast in the wrong light, then I suspect that
there will be a marked decrease in the quantity of information that is offered.
Few of us expect our net mail to wind up published in the commercial press,
and only the brave will knowingly open themselves up to this kind of direct,
external exposure.  And the cost?  Those readers who desperately need the 
information on what is happening may find their information sources again
reduced to RFC's and official notices, carefully worded for public scrutiny.

	This digest was intended as an open forum?  Is a direct pipeline
to the outside world too open?  I solicit discussion on this matter.
Maybe we can reach a consensus?
					Happy New Year!

Subject: Computerworld on the TCP/IP cutover

Well, they're at it again.  Here are some excerpts from the December 14
issue:

	Arpanet, the Pentagon-sponsored packet network that supports U.S.
	computing research, is slated for Jan. 1, 1983 cutover to two
	protocols that some experts predict will revolutionize
	commercial data communications.

	Considered the world's first packet network, Arpanet is expected
	to become an internet -- a network of networks -- ... said an
	informed source, who revealed the cutover date.

It was secret?

	...  Arpanet was not built to support wartime communications
	among the military, but the planned cutover to TCP/IP -- roughly
	a year away -- suggests that computer scientists have a lot of
	confidence in the protocol pair.  An Arpanet crash would
	seriously disrupt American research and development in many
	fields of science and technology, one expert maintained.

	...  A number of TCP/IP developers seem to believe that Arpanet
	will be ready Jan. 1, 1983 cutover [sic] -- but not all of them,
	Arpanet correspondence revealed.

	Available to all Arpanet subscribers, electronic mail files on
	TCP/IP include the following dispatch by a Stanford University
	researcher:

	"Some people [believe] that TCP work on [Digital Equipment
	Corp.'s] Tops-20 [operating system] is 'done.'... I believe
	the 1983 deadline for TCP conversion will not be met.  I have
	worked on BBN's TCP at the user program level; specifically, I
	have implemented general user Telnet for TCP as part of a
	general multiple-network Telnet for Tops-20.

	"Briefly, the Tops-20 TCP implementation in its present form is
	unacceptable to Stanford and many othe Tops-20 sites.  It is sad
	that so many bright people at BBN have had to maintain this dog
	instead of working on a complete rewrite."

	This critic wrote, in his Arpanet communique, that "the TCP
	process consumes between 40% and 60% of the CPU.  We simply
	cannot sacrifice that much of an already-loaded CPU to implement
	a network ."

[ I suppose that the TCP Digest quoting ComputerWorld quoting the TCP Digest
  is only fair!  -Mike ]

    Your TCP-IP digest entry caught my attention concerning
    addressing capability in the IP protocol. I'd like to know
    more about your "internet packet radio" since it isn't
    one of the projects ARPA is supporting. Is this something
    you are pursuing as a graduate or undergraduate effort
    or supported by another funding agency?

Amateur Packet Radio is an experimental networking implementation
among Amateur Radio Operators under the regulation of the FCC.  It
is a group of "hams" creating a network for digital communication
among citizens.  It is not supported by ARPA or any government agency
(although AMRAD hosted an "Amateur Radio Computer Networking
Conference" in conjunction with NBS in October).

We currently favor the Internet Protocols, with minimal modifications,
to encourage timely comprehension, software development, and
extramural connection.  Our network has two constraints that we hope
are not unique, which is why I sent my query to TCP-IP, hoping for
known solutions.  They are:

	There is no underlying software protocol; IP Datagrams are
	transmitted without enclosure at the lowest level. (This
	is not, so far, a problem, but we're wondering if anyone else
	is doing similarly.)  The medium is broadcast and there are 
	contention problems.

	There is no central authority; no user sign-up; no fixed
	connectivity or user location.  Each terminal node runs the
	same program with a small number of variables different (at
	least one unique).  Nodes can appear, disappear, and move at
	any time; connectivity depends on electromagnetic weather.
	We had trouble with 24-bit addresses in this environment,
	since we have no way to create unique addresses that short.

If the TCP-IP mailing list is for Official U. S. Government users
only, rather than for the clarification, distribution, evolution, and
improvement of the standard among all who are gaining experience with
it, then please excuse my assumption and have me removed from it.

[ Nope, you are in the right place.  -Mike ]

1. TCP-IP Digest is an open forum and your entry was perfectly
valid - just caught my attention since I didn't know about the
internet protocol choice by the Amatuer Packet Radio group. I did
know a little about the private Packet Radio work.

2. Use of raw IP formats could cause you some trouble. The current
  architectural assumptions are that a gateway can "direct" an
  IP THROUGH another gateway, but to do this, it uses a lower
  layer of addressing (encapsulation philosophy). This seemed
  quite natural to us during design of IP since all the nets we
  were concerned with or knew about had a lower layer format with
 local addressing - even Ethernets.

  In a single network architecture, populated with a blizzard
  of private packet radios, you are faced with a number of
  challenges. First, the generation of unique identifiers.
  Second, the use of these identifiers to aid in routing
  decisions.  I am not entirely convinced that a geographic
  basis is necessarily helpful - in the ARPA packet radio net,
  for example, the actual location of a radio is not always a
  good indicator of its radio connectivity into the system.
  Routing towards its geophysical location may in fact fail
  while routing "away" toward the high mountain peak which is
  in LOS may help.  

  In your case, some geographic knowledge may help to structure
  the system hierarchically - this is sometimes used to effect
  "area routing."

3. As long as you stay within the confines of a single net,
   24 bits allows some 16 million destination identifiers
   which seem to me to be quite a few for a respectable amateur
   packet radio network. One might artificially use up several
   network numbers if it appeared that 16 million wasn't enough.
   The harder problem is to make these numbers useful for routing
   purposes and to do this, one obviously needs to bind the
   identifiers to some location.  Clearly you have attempted to
  do this with the lat/long strategy.

4. Quite frankly, we didn't envision this particular use when
   we designed IP - and your trick of using an option format
   to provide more detailed information is certainly the kind
  of extension we designed options for - even if it does strain
  your esthetic senses.

5. As to handling true internetting and providing for routing
  THROUGH gateways without losing track of the final net/destination,
   either the amateur packet radio network needs to define a lower
  level addressing structure, or you need to consider another option
  which identifies not only the source and destination but also
  the "next" gateway.  This is really just a form of source
  routing.

6. The hardest problem, really, is going to be handling the
  area routing and dissemination of routing information
  throughout the system. If connectivity changes frequently
  for physical reasons (propagation effects) or because repeaters
  go up and down whimsically, then managing the routing problem
  is going to be quite a challenge.

Tops-20 isn't the only system that has problems with that use of the
period. Multics does also. Notice, for instance, the sender of this
