Subject: Re: Special Hacks vs. Standard Hosts

It is now very easy to turn off both trailer protocols and address resolution
protocol.  The ifconfig program, run at boot time to set the local network
address, allows those options to be set or cleared.  It is possible to
use both ARP and the "old" address mapping dependent on the address range,
but this does require changing the value of a global variable to specify
the boundary between them.  Also, as part of the ARP implementation,
there is a way of asking about the ability to do trailer encapsulation,
and thus ARP hosts that do not do trailers should be handled transparently.
Given that it is so easy to disable trailers, I don't think there should
be any concern about compatibility.  I will be adding a section on this
to the installation and operation manual.

I have been working for about one and a half years on MIT's TCP/IP for the
PC (with the 3COM ethernet interface). The programs work, but we're not set
up to distribute them. We started work on them as a research project, but
there is a lot of demand for this type of program. Unfortunately, we're not
set up to distribute and maintain the programs for a large number of users.
We are currently trying to arrange for the code to be both available and
supported. As soon as we make any progress in this area, we'll make an
announcement here.

Please don't deluge me with requests for the programs or the sources. If you
really MUST have a copy, contact Jerry Saltzer (Saltzer@Mit-Multics). I can
answer technical questions about the programs, though.

Subject: Official Policy or Buggy Procedure ?
To:   TCP-ip@sri-nic

Folks:

The tone of many of the recent messages on gateway routing, pinging,
table updates, etc. seems to take on the feel that certain things have
been done according to a mysterious official policy determined by the
nameless them.

It is much more likely that there are bugs in the procedures, that
information that should have been communicated wasn't, or that someone
forgot to do something.

For example, there is this discussion on the importance of pinging dumb
gateways.  One part of the discussion is concered with the fact that for
a time one dumb gateway was not in the set that the prime gateways know
about.  Part of the discussion is based on the assumption that this will
often be the case and therefore hosts have to keep all dumb gateways in
there tables (and possibly ping them).

I think it is more likely that the gateway in question was left out due
to a error or noncommunication.  I think it is a bug in procedures that
should be fixed once, rather that having many hosts do resource
consuming things all the time.

From: POSTEL@usc-isif
Subject: Some Comments on Gateways & Procedures
To:   tcp-ip@sri-nic

There are currently several types of gateways:

   PRIME - these talk to each other and maintain dynamic routing 
   information and have some information about some non-prime gateways.

      These are the best gateways to use.  Just about all the gateways 
      between long haul networks (ARPANET, MILNET, SATNET) are prime 
      gateways.

   DUMB - these don't do the dynamic routing stuff, so have static 
   routing tables (but maybe not complete tables), but do answer pings.

      These are usually gateways between a long haul network and a 
      "stub". A stub is a dead end, typically a single local net.  
      Usually there is no alternate gateway.

   ALWAYS-UP - these don't do dynamic routing and these don't answer 
   pings.

      Like the dumb gateways only dumber, and usually used in the same 
      way - for connecting stubs.  At least one is not tempted to ping 
      these.

The PRIME gateways use a Gateway to Gateway Protocol (GGP) to exchange 
routing information.  The GGP procedures will not be satisfactory for 
large internets.  In fact, the current number of assigned networks is 
close to the limits of GGP's capabilities.

Because the number of gateways known to the PRIME gateways impacts the 
performance of the GGP there is a motivation not to include gateways 
until they are actually ready to pass data traffic.

   Currently, the procedure for making sure a gateway is known to the 
   PRIME gateways is for the responsible person for the gateway to send 
   a computer mail message to "gateway@bbn-unix".

Changes Are Planned:

Some time in the next few months a specification for the Exterior 
Gateway Protocol (EGP) will be finalized.  Once this is done a schedule 
will be established for conversion of all gateways to this protocol.

This will mean that all gateways will have a level of knowledge about 
that of the current PRIME gateways.

     Yes, it is true that in 1822 type networks the network tells the
host about undelivered messages, so nominally there is no need to ping
on those networks.  The problem is that many implementations of TCP,
including the TOPS-20 and Tenex one, ignore the 1822 level information
at TCP level!  As of this writing, the code to collect 1822 information
doesn't even work in the DEC kernal!

     I fixed those bugs for the Stanford TOPS-20's, but I still haven't
come up with a good way to make the IP or TCP levels use it.  A good
deal of effort is taken to insulate the IP and TCP levels from 1822, with
some justification.  To do it right would require some redesign to allow
a transmission level to communicate network/gateway/host accessibility
instead of concluding the other end isn't there by not getting any answer.

     As of right now, the 1822 information is useless on just about all
TOPS-20's but Stanford, where it's collected enough so that the Telnet
program can report a host's Type 6 status if it is down...

Subject: Only PRIME gateways should ping DUMB gateways
To: tcp-ip@sri-nic
Location:  EJ286    Phone: (415) 859-2774

I ask the question: if you list no DUMB gateways, nor ALWAYS-UP gateways,
would not a normal interaction with a PRIME gateway determine
the proper DUMB gateway, even if there were two alternate routes
to the same place and the first potential gateway were dead?

Are you not then causing your own problems when you list
such gateways, if your software will not robustly pass on to the next
one when the first is down, when you have the alternative
of not listing any at all and achieving correct behavior by depending
on a Prime Gateway?

Could we at least be informed of the DUMB gateways known to the
PRIME gateways, so that we can leave such DUMB gateways out of
our tables and win?  If the PRIME gateways knew all the DUMB
gateways in the current NIC host table, that would fill the bill.
Isn't this already nearly enough the truth to be assumed operant?

And furthermore, doesn't the Prime gateway when-to-ping algorithm
solve the problem of pinging too often, even if TOPS-20's IP
does not, making a good workaround for TOPS-20 sites?  I.e.,
not only can TOPS-20 IP's forego pinging DUMB gateways altogether,
but even the resulting number of pingers ping sparingly.

     Well, then.  We seem to have various needs at odds.  Some of us find
ourselves quite distraught when our users scream at us for not being able
to reach some network.  We find that the Prime gateways won't give us any
info about that network.  We find that the gateway for that network is
registered as "dumb".  In our never-ending attempt to follow The Official
Word, we declare said gateways as Always-Up so we don't ping it.  But, if
there is more than one eligible gateway and an Always-Up gateway is in
fact down, we find ourselves equally unable to communicate as we futilly
send messages to an unpinged dead gateway.

     Confusion is rapidly replaced by disgruntlement, and finally by
anger.  In spite of this some of us still try.  Score pings all the NIC
registered dumb gateways and two prime gateways: its assigned Milnet
gateway and another.  I don't think we're winning, but at least we may
have a chance.  Many sites don't try at all and run the vanilla NIC
gateway file.

     Can you blame us?  We have received NO useful guidelines on how to
configure one's gateway table.  We get told not to ping more than two
prime gateways, but find we can't talk to a lot of places.  We get told
to fix our kernals to not ping until that network is needed; a laudable
idea, but many of us don't have the technical skills and those of us who
do have other things to do.  After all, nobody is funding us to work on
the TOPS-20 TCP kernal; BBN and DEC are.  I thought it was claimed that
the TOPS-20 TCP was "done" over a year ago; maybe the Powers That Be want
to revise that claim?

     I claim that the NIC should provide an Officially Sanctioned gateway
table, or set of tables, with sites assigned to such-and-such a table.
Some effort should also be made to identify all the dumb and always-up
gateways to the prime gateways, so that we don't find ourselves obliged
to ping many gateways to ensure connectivity.

Subject: Gateway pinging

By way of information, I have a recent copy of Steve Cohn's ping
matrix.  It shows the message traffic between hosts and gateways.
It was taken on 1 September.

There has been a minor reduction in host pinging since the test
was run on 7 July.  However, you'll see that a substantial number
of hosts are still pinging to excess.

Subject: On the Bad Effects of Pinging
To:   tcp-ip@sri-nic

The IMPs in the ARPANET do some resource reservation (between the source
and destination IMPs) to support the super job they do of delivering 
messages correctly, in order, etc.

There is a limited ammount of this resource.  An IMP can have only a 
limited number of reservations at a time.

If a host tries to send messages to a lot of other hosts in rapid 
succession, the IMPs have to do and undo their resource reservations 
over and over.

Sometimes it takes a while for the IMPs to complete the resource 
reservations. When this happens the IMP may "block" the host.  This 
prevents the host from sending any messages to any host for a while.

If a host send messages to a set of 10 [*] or more other hosts in quick 
succession, it virtually guarantees the host will get blocked for a 
non-trivial time every time it does this.  If a host does this once a 
minute it is virtually guaranteed that the host is geting very poor 
utilization of the ARPANET for its data traffic.

   [*] I don't know the actual number, but i am sure it is less than 10.

It is important to note that a gateway is a host from the point of view 
of the IMP, and the gateway is subject to the same blocking.  When a 
gateway has to send ECHO-REPLIES to many hosts, it too is virtually 
guaranteed to get poor utilization of the ARPANET for its data traffic.

Subject: Some Ideas On a Reduced Level of Pinging
To:   tcp-ip@sri-nic

It is never useful to ping far away gateways.  Only consider pinging 
gateways on your own networks (networks you are directly attached to).

If background pinging is considered then the gateways to ping (if any) 
differ for each host.

   The "ping load" should be spread evenly across all gateways.

   One should ping independenly operated gateways (e.g., on different 
   powers systems).

   One should ping topologically and geographically nearby gateways.

There should be no background pinging.  Unless a gateway is "in use" 
there is no need to know if it is up or down.  Only when there is 
traffic to a gateway is there any need to consider pinging it.

   In ARPANET type networks (e.g., ARPANET, MILNET, MINET) the network 
   tells the host about undelivered messages, so there is no need to 
   ping in these nets.

   In other types of networks it may be useful to ping the "in use" 
   gateways.

The problem with DUMB gateways having alternates is what happens if
the one you choose goes down while you are using it.  Unless your
monitor tells you when a packet is undeliverable, your connection
will just hang.  The PRIME gateway only helps when you first make
the connection.

   A simple change in the way the NIC handles the gateway table may result
in a lot less pinging over the next few months until EGP gets implemented.
But first some background from a different perspective.

   There are 3 functional types of gateways: 
	- PRIME gateways, 
	- dumb or always-up gateways that are 1) the only path into a network
       	  and 2) known to the prime gateways
	- multiple dumb gateways into a network.

   Of these three types, only 1 PRIME gateway ever needs to be pinged (at a
slow interval, say every 120 secs although I don't want to start that argument 
again).  Dumb gateways known to PRIMEs never need to be pinged (so what if 
they are down, there is no other way).  Dual path dumb gateways need to be
pinged (also at a slow interval).

   The INTERNET.GATEWAY tables should be changed to have 2 types of entries:

	- PRIME gateways, pick EXACTLY 1 to ping SLOWLY
	- multiple-path dumb gateways 

(or there could be 2 tables, PRIME and multiple-path DUMB).

All dumb gateways known to PRIME gateways should be removed from the GATEWAY
table and only be listed in the HOST table with a descriptor that it is really
a gateway.  A host would not normally need to know about simple dumb gateways
that are also known to the PRIMEs (if your host doesn't process REDIRECTS--go
to your room without dinner).

Individual hosts could filter their own table until the NIC gets around
to a new table, except that most people don't know which dumb gateways are
known to the PRIMEs.  To help get the information around, when a new gateway
owner wants to register a gateway, the NIC should notify BBN about the new
gateway.  The user, BBN and NIC should then decide if the PRIMES can know
about the dumb gateway or if it is multiple path gateway that needs to go
in the table to be pinged.

Following gateway lines are from [nic]<netinfo>hosts.txt.307.  I have
prefixed the following codes on these lines to indicate some information
used in the BBN gateways (sometimes called 'core gateways').

I hope this will help table maintainers chose gateways for pinging, and
prompt people to advise of gateways which should not be overlooked.

I have made no attempt to define the meaning or use of the terms PRIME,
DUMB, or ALWAYS-UP.  As far as I can tell from the listing, they have
not been consistent.  There are PSAT 'gateways' which are shown as DUMB,
and others as ALWAYS-UP.  There are PRIME systems listed which do not
participate in GGP routing, do not forward packets, or do not issue ICMP
redirect messages.

Roode's statement that PRIME gateways should know about all DUMB
gateways is laudable.  Many of us assumed it was reality.
Unfortunately, it isn't.  Were it to become reality (and be guaranteed
as such), it would make the pinging problem academic.  Every site could
be given its officially assigned two PRIME gateways and that would be
that.

   The gateway list also needs to be trimmed of gateways that are essentally
useless for general internet routing purposes.  For example, I don't think
the various SIMP and PSAT gateways should be included since those gateways
are essentially for internal test use.  Is there a SATNET/WB NET position
on whether those gateways should be included if we assume that any gateway
not known to the BBN/GGP gateways should be pinged?

Subject: Re: Some Comments on Gateways & Procedures

I think it's great that all this stored up knowledge is finally making
it into the open. I have learned a lot about this by having to figure
it out (I have had some willing tutors, scattered across the internet)
in order to keep my users happy and keep my "worked-all-nets" certificate
up to date.

There is at least one additional type of gateway -- the gateway that 
understands (some) GGP, reroutes packets, and speaks full ICMP, but
isn't one of the "core" gateways supported by BBN and participating
in the full GGP conversation. The gateway that I built for the BBN
VAX TCP is one of these; I believe that the standalone gateway at
CMU is also. The MIT C-Gateway may be as well.

Thus, the people that use "my" gateway at their site list it as both
DUMB and PRIME, depending on their intent. If an errant datagram makes
its way to one of these gateways, bound for a network to which the
gateway is not connected, it will send a redirect and route the
'gram appropriately, if it knows how (if it's in the NIC's table,
it probably knows how). So it's not a true stub gateway. It responds
to both GGP and ICMP Pings, so it's not a DUMB or ALWAYS-UP. But
it doesn't send or receive GGP routing updates, so it's not really
PRIME, either.

I have as many of the gateways listed with NIC installed in my tables
as possible; we don't ping gateways unless we're using them, and 
don't in general seem to have too much trouble getting to networks
far and wide. If the core gateways would update their tables to know
about new stub gateways more quickly, I think we would be saved
an awful lot of grief.

Cheers,
chris

I agree it is not a good idea to be pinging WBnet gateways.  Since these
are, at least for the moment, primarly used for experiments, often
including traffic measurements, pinging could distort the results.
Though the access to the internet could be disabled for most
experiments, the WBnet is not yet available for reliable or even
semi-reliable service, and should not really be known about by any
machines not directly participating in the experiments.
