Dear TCP designers and implementors,

     This mailing list must undoubtably be a forum for many TCP
discussions, complaints, and bugs.  You have probably all heard
more than your share about how much slower TCP is than NCP.  This,
however, is not one of those messages.  This is a simple thank-you.

     I have been working on a TCP/IP connection from Germany over
a satellite link back to the United States.  Unfortunately, the
line has been pretty flakey, and we have had frequent outages.
To my amazement, however, I have found out that when we reestablish
connection, I can pick up right where I left off!  We had one
outage that was about 25 minutes long.  I was in the middle of
composing an electronic mail message at the time the line went down.
When it came back up, I was still in the middle of composing the
message (not even an interrupt!), and the characters that I had
typed between the time that the line went down and the time that I
noticed it was down suddenly echoed to me when the line came back up!

     An associate tells me that this is due to the reliability of TCP.

     Thank you TCP & all involved.

We want to start with networking different UNIX Systems (berkeley, bell,
xenix, munix) in a local area network (ethernet). Who has done this work
and which hardware and software can be recommended? Is there any survey
available?  Is anybody using UNET or 3COM or Net/One ?

Many thanks -Heinz

[ 4.2 BSD comes with a TCP/IP that is quite good.  Presently, Bell System V
  does *not* support TCP/IP, but Bell Labs is working on it, under contract
  to U.S. Army DARCOM.  UNET software is also being used by some people, and
  their latest version is reported to be useable.  -Mike ]

From: Chris Kent <decwrl!kent%Shasta@sumex-aim>

Just wanted to let the community know that I've written a network time
user/server pair for 4.1cBSD Unix. I have submitted it to Berkeley for
inclusion in 4.2, but who knows when they'll finally ship? So if people
need it, I'll be happy to send it out.

You'll have better luck mailing to me as <cak@purdue>.

Subject: 4.2 Berkeley Unix protocol violation
From:	imagen!cpr%Shasta@su-score

I've brought this up elsewhere (Unix-Wizards), but I thought I might
mention it to the TCP/IP world directly.  I'm concerned about the Berkeley
4.2 Unix TCP/IP Ethernet implementation, because this version of Unix
uses a private encapsulation protocol for IP packets on 10Mbit Ether, in
violation of the as-yet-unofficial encapsulation protocol.

In detail, the problem is that this TCP implementation uses a non-standard
(i.e., an extension of RFC 820) type of IP packet encapsulation in certain
circumstances, in an attempt at efficiency improvement (due to Unix internal
structures).  This happens with no warning, and with no negotation
whatsoever with the foreign host.  To the foreign host, it simply appears
that the connection is hung at the point the private encapsulation is first
used.

This ``feature'' can be turned off, if you have sources, or are willing to
patch the kernel binary image, but this seems like a big mistake on
Berkeley's part.  Those people trying to supply a product speaking TCP/IP on
Ethernet to the 4.2 Unix world are thus forced to either support this
extension, or else force the site to turn it off on all their 4.2 machines.

Is there an ``official position'' on this type of encapsulation ``violation''
(admittedly by extension)?  (Postel?  Clark?)

Subject: Re: 4.2 TCP/IP/Ethernet trailers

Philisophically, I don't believe there is anything wrong with the
4.2 TCP/IP Ethernet code, it simply imposes another software layer
(the local net encapsulation) between IP and the Ethernet.
Practically, I think it is rather unfortunate since it destroys
compatibility with the "obvious" implementations of IP on Ethernet.
Having some way of negotiating for the use of trailers sounds nice
but it also sounds like another software layer which won't be
present in the "obvious" implementations.  The same sort of problem
exists with ARP.  Perhaps what is needed is a "standard" for how
to implement IP on Ethernet.

In the Sun 4.2 system we've made it easy to turn off trailers in the
driver, however ARP is mandatory.  We may provide a way to "wire down"
ARP translations (however the ARP translation table is by nature a
cache and therefore small) and I guess it would also be possible
to enable trailers based on the destination address.  As we start
talking to other TCP/IP/Ethernet implementations I suspect we will
have to address these problems more directly.

                FURTHER DETAILS ON THE MILNET/ARPANET SPLIT

Testing the Logical Split

The logical  split  of  the existing  ARPANET  into  the  Experimental
ARPANET and the MILNET  is a major  change which requires  substantual
testing to insure it will be accomplished as an orderly process.

ALL HOSTS AND USERS will be impacted. The ARPANET will change from one
network into two, and communications with hosts on the other net  will
require a knowledge of internet procedures.  MILNET  hosts will use  a
new network number (Network  26).  (Details of procuring  updated host
tables from the Network Information Center will be covered in a forth-
coming newsletter.)

The MILNET and the ARPANET will remain connected via five mail bridges
(internet gateways augmented  with a load-splitting  mechanism and  an
access control filter). The load-splitting mechanism works as follows.
Each bridge will contain  a table assigning  the "default" bridge  for
each host to use in sending traffic  to the other network.  If a  host
sends a  message  via the  wrong  bridge  and its  default  bridge  is
operational, the host will receive an ICMP redirect message telling it
which alternate gateway (i.e., default bridge) to use.  This mechanism
allows the five gateways to  balance the internet traffic.  After  the
initial default  assignment, if  one of  the bridges  is found  to  be
carrying  a  disproportionate  share  of  the  load,  then  the   host
assignment table will  be modified.  No changes to  host software  are
required.  As  long  as a  host  supports  ICMP,  the  host-to-gateway
protocol, it can  make full  use of  the bridges  without knowing  its
default bridge assignment in advance.

A schedule has been developed for  testing prior to the actual  split.
The goals of this testing are to:

     o Verify the mail bridge load-splitting mechanism and
       access control filter.

     o Test host TCP/IP and ICMP implementations.

     o Test the entire system networkwide.

Initial testing will use the testbed environment already available  at
BBN.  BBN has a local  ARPANET-clone network, the BBNNET (Network  8),
which is connected to the ARPANET via a gateway.  During daytime hours
the BBNNET passes about 50% as much traffic as does the ARPANET,  with
the existing gateway passing about 1,000,000 packets during an average
day, with about 80,000 packets per hour passing through it during peak
hours.  This represents  a significantly heavier  load than will  pass
through any  of  the five  mail  bridges, therefore  the  BBNNET  will
provide a realistic test environment.

The testing schedule is:

15 June:  Two additional gateways between the ARPANET and the BBNNET
          are installed.

30 June:  The gateway load-splitting mechanism is operational.

15 June to 15 August:  Gateway load-splitting and routing between
          the ARPANET and the BBNNET are verified.

To aid users in verifying  their capabilities to communicate with  the
MILNET, the  first MILNET  host to  receive net  number 26  will be  a
public news host  implemented  on a C/70,  which will allow  anonymous
logins and  will  contain  information  of  general  interest  to  the
ARPANET/MILNET community.

In addition, to assist TAC users, a TACNEWS service will be  provided.
By typing "@n" to the TAC, a TAC user will automatically be  connected
to the public news host wherever  it may exist without having to  know
its actual internet address.

Following are some of the major milestones of the Split.

1 July - 1 September:  The mail bridges between ARPANET and MILNET
          are installed.

15 July:  The C70 public news host is installed as the first host in
          the  MILNET COI.  Also, a  second MILNET interface will be 
          added to SRI-NIC.  Host managers  and  technical personnel
          should now  try to connect to the  C/70 news host  via the
          mail bridges in order to test their  ICMP implementations.

28 July - 2 August:  Network technical liaison meetings in:
          Los Angeles and San Francisco, Cambridge and Washington DC

1 September - 1 October:  The NIC  maintains the old  (ARPANET-only)
          and  the new  (ARPANET/MILNET)  host tables  in  parallel.
          During  this period  MILNET hosts may  voluntarily  change
          to Network No. 26 provided their changeover is coordinated
          with the NIC to permit timely update of the official  host
          tables.  Two full day  tests will occur, during which  the
          network will enforce the split, and hosts must use the new
          host tables.

4 October:  The logical split occurs.  Network IMPs will enforce the
          proper COI for each host, and network addressing   will be
          updated to reflect the split.

1 Febuary 1984:  Access control filters  are implemented in the mail
          bridges.  Although  this capability has  existed  for some
          time, its implementation is deferred to reduce the problems
          associated with the logical split on 4 October.
