Hi!

The intent of the new RFCs on Telnet (854-861) is to clean up the 
documents on the basic Telnet protocol and to make available current
specifications of the most used Telnet Options.  There is no intent to
change the Telnet protocol at this time.

To:   TCP-IP@Brl.ARPA

Hi!

The intent of the new RFCs 862 - 868 is to document a set of little
service protocols that have existed for many years.  Each of the
protocols is a very simple service, and most are used only for debugging.
In these RFCs, each protocol is defined for use with either TCP or UDP.

Subject:  communication with strange hosts
To: unix-wizards@Sri-Unix.ARPA, tcp-ip@Brl.ARPA

In order to evaluate proposals for a central computing facility,
I need to gather information about the ability of competing vendors
to communicate with our departmental UNIX systems running 4.2bsd.  Many
vendors support HASP and I gather with work one can  do something with this.
I also have the impression that TCP/IP is avaialable for VAX VMS

For the following systems I solicit information about 
known versions of TCP/IP. I would also welcom comments
about the suitabilty of a HASP interface, especially for non-IBM
systems.  Our needs are principally remote login and file transfer
with the alien (non unix) host , secondarily  mail transfer.

Please reply directly to me, not the list. I will summarize unless someone
tells me that such summaries have already appeared.

Mike,

Tom and I have been having an interesting discussion about the
expansion of the internet and how it is going to impact gateways and
protocols. Tom suggested we open up the discussion to a larger forum
and I agree with him; perhaps TCP-IP Digest is the right place. I'll
forward the transcript so far (in a separate note) and you can decide.

Subject: Re: grabbing a bunch of class C numbers

From your recent message to Header-People:

    Along the same lines, there seems to be a recent trend for groups that
    are bringing up private internets to grab a bunch of class C numbers,
    rather than one class B number that they manage privately. I think this
    is wrong. The Internet is cluttered enough with routing packets between
    gateways; why should the rest of the world know that you have, say, an
    10Mb Ethernet, 3Mb Ethernet, Proteon ring, serial line IP, fiber
    optics, and back-to-back parallel interfaces? I certainly don't care.
    It should all be invisible to the outside world. 

It is interesting to me that you think this is happening.  I'd like to
examine what it would mean to manage a class B number privately.  There
are two points of view from which the allocation of Internet network
numbers can be approached:  the point of view of the site that is
bringing up a private internet, and the point of view of the
administrators of the Internet as a whole.

First, the point of view of the site that is bringing up a private
internet.  The site probably already has more than one
local-area-network (LAN) technology:  I would suspect generally you
would find 10mb Ethernet plus some other technology.  The site is
looking for internet as the solution to their local networking problem.
They can get Internet support for lots of their local machines.  Now
part of the Internet support they will get extends down into what
Internet calls the local network interface (LNI).  The local network
interface plugs down into the physical characteristics of the
local-area-network and determines how things such as address resolution
work.  It determines how what Internet calls a local network maps onto
the physical local-area-network technology.  The local network interface
may or may not be modifiable.

Now in all cases I have seen, the local network interface maps the
Internet concept of local network onto the obvious addressing structure
supported by the local-area-network technology.  For example, IPs
running on top of the 10mb Ethernet see an Internet local network which
consists of those stations connected to the 10mb Ethernet cable.  This
is really a reasonable thing to do.  It lets the local network interface
use the hardware directly to fulfill its contract to deliver packets on
the Internet local network, and it lets the IP module worry about
inter-network routing.

So we can expect that a site with several local-area-networks will want
to set up each LAN as an Internet network, with Internet gateways
between them.  This is the most straightforward application of existing
IP implementations.

Second, the point of view of the administrators of the Internet as a
whole.  These people have got to be concerned with the growth in the
number of Internet networks.  If things keep on as they are going at
present, soon we will see the day of 10000 networks.  Jolly-Roger
Flea-Net gateway is going to be displeased when it EGP dials up its
friendly BBN neighbor gateway and gets the list of best-next-step
gateways.  I don't see anything being done about this problem.

So much for the points of view.  What ought to be happening?  As you
point out in your note, the local network structure of a site ought to
be invisible to the rest of the Internet world.  Certainly, the internal
structure of any site that is connected to the rest of the world via
one gateway is irrelevant to the rest of the world.  The trouble is that
the only way to express this irrelevance in IP is to make the entire
site one Internet network; for example, a class B network, as you
suggest.  But then, internal to the site, IP becomes useless as a tool
for tying together all of their different local-area-networks.  The site
will have to implement its own inter-local-area-network routing so that
the Internet local network interfaces can preserve the appearance of
one connected class B network.  This might be difficult keep up as new
machines are introduced.  (Our SUN terminal supports IP on the 10mb
Ethernet!--its version of a local network interface with a certain
encapsulation onto the 10mb Ethernet, of course.)

If an IP/LNI implementation for a local-area-network is designed under
the assumption that the local-area-network directly implements the
Internet local network (as far as I know, this is the case for all
existing implementations), then it will not work if you want the LAN to
be only one component in the Internet local network.  The only
possibility, other than modifying the IP/LNI implementation, is to
attach "leeches" to each LAN.  These leeches suck up raw packets,
encapsulate them up into an inter-LAN protocol, route them around
though some backbone network to the destination LAN, then spit them
back out as raw packets again.  Even this possibility only works where
the LANs have enough addressing space individually to cover the entire
Internet local network and where the leeches can arrange to receive
packets that are addressed to many different destinations.  There are
lots of subtleties involved in the implementation of the leeches, as
well.

I say, this is complicated.  It may, however, be the only way to go.  For
hosts that come ready to plug into a LAN, there may be no possibility
of dividing an IP/LNI implementation--a site will have to take what
comes out on the LAN as a given.  There is nothing in Internet between
the concept of a connected Internet local network and the concatenation
of all Internet networks--either you are at the level of implementing
an Internet local network or you are implementing the entire Internet.

If I were in charge of bringing Internet to Carnegie-Mellon, the use of
many class C network numbers would be one definite alternative.  It
seems more in the "spirit" of IP to map the existing mechanisms in
Internet onto the structure of the problem.  Lots of people are working
on Internet gateways; I'd have natural encapsulations on all of my
LANs; there'd be lots of software to help me out.  I'd also be
contributing to the Internet network number explosion.  The second real
alternative would be to use the "leech" scheme I've outlined.  Even it
wouldn't work in all places--our 3mb Ethernet, for example--so I'd still
have to have either multiple Internet network numbers or modified LNIs
for these cases.  And of course now I'm all alone implementing leeches
with their own routing and updating algorithms to get right.  It would
be lots of fun, to be sure, but one wonders how many times the same
problem has to be solved.

Subject: Re: grabbing a bunch of class C numbers

I agree with your interpretations of the two points of view; but I
think that your choices of solutions are shortsighted.

Organizations (I use this here to mean groupings of private networks
that wish to communicate with the Internet via core gateways) will have
to perform some form of internal routing, no matter whether each of
their wires has a distinct class C network or not. They will have to do
this because of the way EGP is structured; the simplest solution is, of
course, to have one EGP gateway which touches the Arpanet and all the
local wires. This will clearly have severe performance penalties, so
there will be a move to multiple internal gateways and some
gateway-to-gateway protocol, including the EGP gateway.

Yes, most LNIs perform some mapping of Internet addresses to local
network addresses (viz David Plummer's Ethernet address resolution
protocol). That has nothing to do with the way subnets are managed; it
merely describes a mechanism for mapping 32-bit Internet addresses onto
(in this case) 48-bit addresses. How those 32-bit addresses are
organized is strictly arbitrary, as far as the protocol is concerned.

Indeed, the *current* specification of IP does not indicate how one
should manage a subnet. There are clearly several straightforward
extensions to the addressing structure that make this possible; I have
outline and implemented one of them locally; others exist at CMU and
LBL and Linkabit and ... and yes, they all require the ability to
modify the IP implementation(s) at hand.. So far, this has not been a
problem. As the IP catches on and begins appearing in binary form
inside products, there will be problems. That is why I am making a lot
of noise NOW to have extensions made to the IP specifications to cover
these cases.

Specifically, what I propose is that there be added to the
implementation another level of hierarchy, which fits completely within
the 16-bit local portion of a class B address. Sites that wished to use
another mechanism internally could do so; but there should be a default
that appears within the specification, so that different vendors of IP
software could have common ground. My particular implementation of
subaddressing is fairly convoluted because I can't modify my Arpanet gateway.

I don't think that IP need be "useless as a tool for tying together all
of their different local-area-networks", IF A STANDARD IS PROPOSED AND
ACCEPTED. That's the point of all these lists that flood my mailbox and
yours; to discuss and modify and improve our networking environment. I
believe that my proposal is a straightforward, logical, and upward
compatible extension of the current standard.

You will notice that I have ignored your idea of leech machines. To be
honest, I find the idea rather distasteful. I don't like the idea of
promiscuous receivers on my networks. It sounds like it is very subtle,
tricky, and error-prone. 

These are probably religious issues; I hope that I have presented my
views in a scientific and logical, rather than fanatical, manner. Your
comments are welcome, as always.

Cheers,
chris

Subject: Re: grabbing a bunch of class C numbers

Currently, a site either has to set up each of its local-area-networks
as a separate IP network, or it has to cobble together a single IP
network through some conspiracy of local network interfaces and
inter-LAN bridges.  The first alternative contributes to the IP network
number explosion and consequently is distasteful from the point of view
of the IP administrators.  The second alternative requires
implementation at a second level of routing algorithms essentially
identical to those of IP and consequently is distasteful from the point
of view of the site administrators.  In sum, IP as currently defined is
not really a useful tool in solving a multi-LAN site's fundamental
problem of intermachine datagram transport.

I fully agree with your statement that IP could become a useful tool
for solving this problem if a new standard were proposed and adopted.  I
guess that I am less optimistic than you are about the chances of this
coming to pass.  (Although I will admit that the Apranet conversion went
fantastically better than I had expected.)

In order for IP to assist in the solution of a multi-LAN site's machine
interconnection problem without contributing to the IP network number
explosion, the concepts of IP network and local delivery area must be
separated.  Currently it is the case that an IP implementation assumes
that all IP addresses on the same IP network are in the local delivery
area, which is to say that the local network interface takes the
responsibility of delivering datagrams to and from hosts at these
addresses without the need of any further concern from the IP level.
The problem is that information about every IP network has to appear at
every IP gateway.  This would not be necessary if there were some kind
of hierarchy of networks--similar to what has been proposed for name
server domains.  In this case a site could subdivide its campus-wide IP
network into subnetworks corresponding to the physical implementation,
and get local inter-subnetwork IP routing without having to burden the
outside world with knowledge of the subnetwork structure.  This sounds
like a general statement of what you are proposing ought to be done.

I should state that it is possible to conceive of IP implementations
managing the IP network number explosion by deducing clusters of class
C network numbers that had similar routing parameters.  Tricks like this
would have to appear at least in every IP gateway, if not in every
host, and consequently seem very unlikely to come to pass.  Also, as far
as I can tell, it seems that the Internet administration is passing out
IP network numbers in sequence, which means geographically at random,
so eventually I would expect entrophy to catch up with any kind of
smart clustering heuristic.

Now it seems that currently sites are taking one of two approaches to
solving their multi-LAN networking problem.  Some sites are getting a
separate IP network number for each of their local-area-networks.  We
all agree that this in not a desirable solution from the point of view
of the Internet as a whole.  Other sites are locally amending the IP
specification to provide some sort of local subnetwork structure
understood by their local IP implementations.  This approach runs the
risk of setting up all kinds of incompatibilities.

The opinion I have from Postel is that he thinks that all of the
problems of subnetwork structure should be hid inside the local network
interface.  Besides the potential problem this presents to a site of
reimplementing routing in the LNI, there is also the difficulty that no
specification exists for how the local network interface should perform
its duties on popular local-area-networks such as the Ethernet.
Consequently, there is no guarantee that products from two vendors both
claiming to support IP on the Ethernet will even talk to one another.
So far we've been getting by because there exists a pretty obvious
encapsulation for the case that the Ethernet LAN implements one IP
network.

As you point out, any irregularities in local implementations of IP on
a given kind of physical link will increasingly become problems as IP
catches on and real vendor products start to appear.  The question is
whether or not it is too late to amend the IP specification to allow a
subnetwork level in the hierarchy.  My impression is that it is too late
even to amend the implicit agreement on how the LNI uses the Ethernet,
but I have been wrong before.  Anyway, I'm really worried about the
short term problems that will start to come to roost in the next year
or so.

It occurs to me that perhaps the general interest would be better
served if our exchange were published in, say TCP-Digest.  I generally
don't dive into hot debate on the net, but as I have seen virtually no
discussion of this topic, perhaps some interest needs to be kindled.
Your responces are welcome.
