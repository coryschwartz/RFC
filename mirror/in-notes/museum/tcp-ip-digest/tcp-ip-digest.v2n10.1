Subject: looking for a TCP/IP implementation for a IBM 4341.

I am trying to set up a full service communications link between my VAX 
and an IBM 4341 that is about 400 feet away in another building.  The
4341 is running VM/370 and the VAX is running 4.1 UNIX (with BBN TCP/IP).
Ideally I am looking for an implementation of TCP/IP that runs under
VM/370 and network hardware that is compatible with both the VAX and
the 4341 (ethernet?).  When I asked the IBM rep her answer was "What's
TCP/IP?". Oh, Well so much for "No. 1".

It seems we have acquired yet another "strange" machine at Rice.
Does anyone know of a TCP/IP implementation for CMS under VM/SP
on an IBM 4341?  If so, how can I obtain a copy, and what
network interfaces does it support?

	We at Caltech are also concerned about TCP for a 4341 since IBM is
upstairs right now installing one. We have a systems programmer who is
interested in implementing TCP/IP under VM/CMS. Of course, we would rather
port an exisiting implementation. We plan to connect our 4341 to our local
Ethernet through its UNIBUS. Thats right, our 4341 has a UNIBUS. It appears
IBM is now manufacturing a device called a DACU which is an IBM PC with
a UNIBUS that attaches to a channel. Like the others, we'd welcome any
suggestions.
						    Dan Whelan

Our machine is just being installed now, but not all of the hardware
is here yet (including the DACU). I'll have more to add when we've played
around with it. My understanding is that the unit sells for 12-13K.

The Network Graphics Project at Stanford, now called the Partitionable
Computer Systems project, has developed an implementation of the IP/TCP
protocols.  It is structured as an "internet server" within the V
distributed system.  Processes anywhere in the system (on the same or
different workstation) may send it standard V messages using the V I/O
protocol.  The objects manipulated are either raw IP sockets or TCP
connections.  Its major use is virtual terminal communication from
graphics workstations through telnet.  It has been tested with the BBN
Vax/Unix, Berkeley 4.1c Unix, and BBN TOPS-20 implementations of TCP.

The internet server is portable with the rest of the V-System, since it
is all written in C.  Currently the V-System runs on five different
68000 systems based on the SUN CPU board, and is in the process of
being ported to the VAX.  The internet server is mostly the work of
Marvin Theimer, network address mmt@SU-HNV (or mmt%Diablo@Score).  It
is 37K bytes of object code + 7K data including libraries, and about
5000 lines of C source code.  The V-System is being licensed by the
Stanford Office of Technology Licensing, 415-497-0651.

Cc: tcp-ip@brl, bbn-tcp@bbn-unix, jr@bbncd

Certainly in the Unix environment one gets almost all the way there with
a combination of shell scripts and at(1).  The only troublesome aspect
is how to deal with deferring login at the remote site.  Also, FTP may
not in fact return error codes to the shell if the destination is
unreachable (some do, some don't).

Using mail (e.g. smtp) to send files isn't too bad a choice.  One could
add a control line (instead of or in addition to a normal mail header),
and queue the incoming message in a special directory where a daemon
scans the inbox from time to time and breaks the files apart again.
Giving this daemon root priveleges avoids the login issue, but
introduces security holes if it isn't careful (ought to setuid and
setgid before delivering the file).  Probably want this daemon to have
a private file system to avoid filling up /usr when something goes
wrong.

Subject:  TCP/IP for VMS

We are currently running Compion's Access-X product (Access-T which can
be interfaced to your own link level) with no problems.  I have written
a driver interfacing the IP layer to the Proteon PRONET 10-Mbit ring
interface.  As a result, we have telnet and ftp connection to our 4.1A
UNIX host.  I have also interfaced the software tools mail delivery
system to use TCP circuits to support SMTP between the hosts, thus
providing a coherent mail system.  The user-interface utilities for
that mail system are sndmsg and msg clones.

As far as performance, I don't think anyone should expect blinding
speed from Compion's TCP/IP implementation, due to the modularity
employed in their software.  TCP service is provided by an ACP servicing
qio requests to a pseudo-device.  IP service is provided by another ACP
servicing requests to another pseudo-device.  The IP layer simply queues
up multiple read and write requests to the backend device driver.  As a
result, characters typed to user telnet when the remote host is providing
the character echo result in 6 process context switches per packet
(which may be single characters).  Other user protocols, such as ftp and
smtp, which are more block at a time oriented perform better, but still
suffer 6 context switches per request/response pair.  While this
architecture may not be the bottleneck when communicating with the
ARPANET, it is definitely the bottleneck when communicating over a
high-speed local net.

We have experienced none of the system-crashing bugs described above, as
I have been informed by Compion personnel that most of the outstanding
bugs were fixed in the Access-T 1.6 release, with which we share the
user and server utilities.  Our experience has been extremely positive,
not only with the software, but with the Compion personnel who aided us
in our attempts to be the first user site to link to our own network
link level.  It is an extremely easy way to get up to speed on TCP/IP on
VMS.

Subject: FURTHER DETAILS ON THE ARPANET/MILNET SPLIT

[ This message is an excerpt from DDN Newsletter 27, concerning the
  MILNET/EXPNET split.  For more information, contact <NIC@NIC>.  -Mike ]


Introduction

As previously discussed  in DDN  Newsletter 26,  the existing  ARPANET
will soon  be split  into  two separate  networks -  the  experimental
ARPANET and the operational  MILNET.  Hosts on  the two networks  will
intercommunicate  via  mail  bridges,   using  the  internet   gateway
mechanisms to pass  mail traffic  between hosts on  the two  networks.
The mail bridges will,  on a controlled  basis, provide full  internet
gateway services for MILNET hosts that request it.

The Logical Split

Because it takes a large amount of time and effort to physically split
a network  in a  coherent manner,  the ARPANET  will initially,  on  4
October  1983,  be  logically  partitioned  by  the  use  of  existing
mechanisms in the IMPs to enforce  segregation of hosts and TACs  into
separate communities of  interest.  Each community  of interest  (COI)
becomes a virtual network,  i.e., hosts (including  TACS) in the  same
community can fully interoperate as is currently the case, while hosts
in different communities  cannot directly  intercommunicate. This,  in
effect, transforms the ARPANET  into an Internet  in which the  MILNET
will assume  a new  class  A network  number,  network 26,  while  the
ARPANET  remains  network  10.   (Details  of  the  host   renumbering
procedures will  be covered  in a  later newsletter  from the  Network
Information Center (NIC).)

Intercommunication between the MILNET and ARPANET is via mail  bridges
which use  standard internet  protocols and  mechanisms to  pass  data
between hosts in the  two networks.  This is  why the conversion  from
NCP to TCP/IP is  so important; any host  with a fully working  TCP/IP
implementation (including ICMP, the host-gateway protocol), should see
no loss  in  service  because  of  the  split.  However,  hosts  using
incomplete TCP/IP implementations (those that do not include ICMP as a
part of  IP,  or  have  no  provision  for  using  gateways)  will  be
restricted to  communicating  with  other TCP/IP  hosts  in  the  same
network.  In particular, this means that they will not be able to send
(or receive) mail traffic  through the bridges to  hosts in the  other
network.

THERE CAN BE NO EXEMPTIONS TO THE SPLIT!!

Unlike the NCP-to-TCP  conversion which  is still underway  for a  few
hosts, once the  split occurs, there  is nothing that  can be done  to
allow a host with an incomplete TCP/IP to fully intercommunicate  with
the other  network other  than  helping them  to  convert to  a  fully
working TCP/IP as soon as possible.

Future DDN Newsletters will  discuss in greater  detail how the  split
affects the users  and host  software maintainers, and  how the  split
will be tested before it is finally implemented in October.

The Physical Split

Concurrent with  the logical  split the  network is  being  physically
split as  well.  Many  new  trunks are  being  added to  support  each
network, and  a  number of  trunks  will eventually  be  removed  once
replacement trunks have been installed.  The first quarter of CY  1984
has been established as the goal for completion of the physical split,
but this is dependent upon delivery  of new circuits from the  TELCOs,
some of which have very long lead times (over a year in some cases).

To complete the physical split, hosts and terminals which are homed on
the wrong IMP or TAC must be rehomed.  In some cases, a new IMP on the
proper network will be used;  in other cases, a  host may need to  use
HDH (the HDLC-based replacement  for VDH) in order  to gain access  to
its network via a  remote IMP.  In either  case, the host must  change
its network address,  and the TAC  users of these  hosts must be  made
aware of the change. Both host  and terminal rehoming will be kept  to
the absolute minimum possible.
