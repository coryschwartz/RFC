Reliable information has it that IBM Federal Systems Division
has developed a version of TCP/IP for one or more IBM operating
systems.  IBM internally is evaluating the possibility of making
a "real product" of the implementation.

Persons or organizations interested in such a product should talk to 
their IBM marketing reps (who may know nothing about the fact this is
going on...or even what TCP/IP is) and make sure that the rep fills
out a P.S.R.R. on their requirements.  This will help convince IBM
officials that there is indeed a market for such a product.

Subject:  TCP/IP Conversion Date

Based on recent discussions with DCA about the ArpaNet, I offer these tidbits:

Just as a reminder, the 1-Jan-83 date for conversion to TCP/IP only
on the ArpaNet is **rock solid**.  Hosts which do not have the new
protocols running will be unable to access the network.

Also, those sites still running Honeywell H316s as TIPs (not TACs)
will be unable to reach any hosts with those TIPs.

All Honeywell equipment is supposed to be removed from the network
by March 83;  some sites still have not ordered C/30 equipment.

All Pluribus equipment was removed from the net in October of this year.

Subject:  ArpaNet Split

At the ArpaNet Sponsor's meeting yesterday, the following letter
was distributed, with a list of host & IMP alignmets in the new
networks.

---

B610					29 Oct 1982


	The existing ARPANET will be split into a network for operational
traffic (MILNET) and an experimental network which will retain the name
ARPANET.  Current plans are to effect this split in late CY83.
Communications between the two networks will be via mail-forwarding
servers provided by DCA.  The IMP, TAC, and Host alignments on the MILNET
or the Experimental Network are enclosed.

	It is recognized that in some cases the alignment is not as
originally requested by the sponsor.  Alignment decisions were made
following careful consideration of inputs from sponsors, together with
the desire of DARPA to reduce the size of the ARPANET to a more
manageable size for continued network and internetwork experimentation.

	Alignment reclamas should be submitted to DCA Code B610.  Those
reclamas requesting IMP, TAC, or Host participation on the Experimental
Network will be forwarded to DARPA for review and approval.  Reclamas
will be accepted until 15 Jan 83.  Final network alignments and initial
scheduling for the ARPANET split will be announced by 4 Feb 83.

				Sincerely,

				(initialed)
				HEIDI B. HEINDEN
				COL, USA
				DDN Program Manager

----

For those sites unsure of their alignment, check with your
ArpaNet sponsor.  Sites needing Host connections to both networks
must submit an RFS (Request for Service) through regular channels
for the additional connections.

A two-stage approach to accomplishing the split will be employed.
First will be a logical separation using the COI (community of interest)
feature of the IMPs, to take place around July 83.

At that time 4 "special" InterNet gateways will go into operation, 2 on
each cost, at DCEC, BBN, ISI, and SRI.  These gateways will only forward
InterNet packets for the SMTP protocol, permitting only a mail connection
between the two networks.  TAC access control for the MILNET TACs will
be added as soon as feasable after this partitioning.
MILNET will be class A network number 26 (the old AUTODIN II number),
while ARPANET will retain class A network number 10.

The second stage will involve an actual reconfiguration of backbone
circuits, making the separation of the networks a physical partitioning.
This is targeted for Jan 84.  NCC and NIC services will be availible on
both nets, with DCA running the MINET NOC and BBN running the ArpaNet NOC.

At the time of the physical partitioning, DES encryption will be added to
all MILNET trunks, and all MILNET IMPs will have to be relocated to
"restricted" locaions.  DCA has defined a "restricted" location as
(this is NOT an exact quote) an area which can be accessed by authorized
personnel only, all others to be accompanied by an escort, in a
controled access room with either locked doors (card or key access)
or a guarded door with access lists and positive identification.
All authorized personnel will be ADP.II cleared personnel only
as per OPM directive CSC78.

DISCUSSION.  (My own personal opinions).

There are very good engineering reasons for partitioning the network
into two separate pieces.  Simply from the point of view of adding
more bandwidth to the existing network, the additional trunking
provided by the split will improve performance greatly.  This will
also permit expansion of the two networks to proceed without interfering
with each other.  The planned growth for the ArpaNet is low, while
the MILNET is expecting explosive growth.  Something like 50 new
MILNET sites are already in the works.

The InterNet concept makes this split an easily accomplished thing,
thanks to the InterNet gateways.  However, the "special" gateway is
a thing which tends to diminish the value of the split by only allowing
mail traffic across it.  I invite the readers of the digest to
discuss this issue.

The reason for the existance of a restrictive gateway is, of course
that old bugaboo, "security".  Seems like many of the military people
are scared of having University students "at large" on their network.
There are some serious loss-of-service issues which properly concern
users of MILNET.  Discussion?

As a straw-man counter proposal, what would people think about
the following aproach:  when the logical split is performed,
make the gateways FULL internet gateways, to allow the net to
"shake itself down" after having half the host numbers change,
and then add an intermediate step a month or two later where
the gateways are restricted to "special" mail-forwarding gateways
only.  This would, at least, allow the two shocks to the network
to be separated slightly from each other, allowing some time to
recover from any possible errors in net assignment before dropping
service to anybody.

PS:  While on the subject of host numbers changing, Jon Postel pointed out
that host numbering will be changing on almost a daily basis, the growth
of the InterNet being what it is.  Hence, all implementors are urged to
consider having your systems automatically fetch the latest table from
the NIC each time the system is rebooted, and possibly more frequently.

Subject:  "Special" Gateways for Mail (SMTP)

In my earlier message it may seem that I might not care for the
way that the "Special" Gateways were to be implemented.  This
is not true at all!  Given that there are going to be special (restrictive)
interconnections between the networks, what better way to do it
than with a simple modification to the existing InterNet gateway
code?

As the folks from BBN indicated at the meeting, using the InterNet
Gateway is a nice, general solution, built on an evolving mechanism --
rather than a special kludge thrown together just to solve this one
problem.  This choice also admits of possibly increased cross-net
servics as the construction of gateways becomes more developed.
The Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) is a good step in this direction.

Another neat benefit is that, for special purposes (demos, special
projects, etc), an exception table can be wired into the "special"
gateways to permit full access between the nets on a host-pair
basis.  A nice safety-valve which will almost certainly be used
to "fix up" the problems encountered by the MILNET/EXPNET separation
this summer.

All in all, a very nice design, assuming one agrees with the need for
the formal separation of the nets.  And that would seem to be a
political issue.

Subject:  FOUO on the ArpaNet, MILNET, DDN

Yesterday afternoon, at the ArpaNet Sponsor's meeting, Col Heiden
(DDN Program Manager) indicated that it was completely acceptable
to transmit FOUO and Privacy Act data across the ArpaNet, as long
as the machines/terminals at either end were acredited for such use.

It was also pointed out that the buzword FOUO has been decomissioned.
Wonder what replaced it?

[ The end of this message included a shortened form of the agreement DEC
  is requesting everyboyd fill out.  I didn't feel that everybody wanted
  to see all the fill-in-the-blank parts.  If you need a copy of the whole
  thing, send a message to <Miller at SRI-NIC>.  -Mike ]

The message below should be passed on to the appropriate
person at each TOPS-20 site.  Software engineering is very
close to releasing the software so some degree of haste in
getting the signed forms into the U.S. Mail would be appreciated.
We are in the process of providing a test version of TOPS-20 which
has both a DEC developed interface and the BBN interface to TCP/IP.

Before we can release the code to any site we must confirm that the
site has a current TOPS-20 license, has a Support agreement, and
understands that the support of this code during the test period
will be limited.  To make this as easy as possible, we have placed 
the text of the necessary paperwork on our system (DEC-MARLBORO).
Also, it is provided below.

All a licensed site has to do is to print out the form, sign it,
and return it to :

     Trish Wing          MR01/S43
     Digital Equipment Corporation
     200 Forest Street
     Marlboro, MA. 01752

     Attn. TCP

Then notify LCG.TCP@DEC-MARLBORO via the net that your signed form
is in the mail.

The software engineering group will then arrange for distribution
via the net.

Using the net in this way should work to the benefit of the sites.
It is the only way that we could think of to get the software to you
with the minimum delay while meeting our requirements for protection.

                                   ADDENDUM A
                           TOPS-20 LICENSE AGREEMENT
                     FOR ALPHA TEST of TOPS-20 WITH TCP/IP

DISTRIBUTION AND SUPPORT/MAINTENANCE:
 
     TCP/IP and related code in TOPS-20 are being made available to 
     ARPAnet customers with Digital Support contracts and TOPS-20 licenses.  
     The required software will be made available as source updates to the 
     currently supported TOPS-20 monitor which (today is an Autopatched V5.0 
     monitor).  Customers will receive support as follows:
 
     1.  The initial TCP/IP update will be based on the latest Autopatch       
         version of the V5.0 monitor.
 
     2.  Updates will occur following any major releases (V5.1) and all     
         Autopatch releases.
 
     3.  No updates between releases are guaranteed.
 
     4.  QARs should be sent on TCP/IP problems via ARPANET to:

                   LCG.TCP@DEC-MARLBORO
 
     5.  In general, updates in response to QARs will be made available thru   
         the next release and not as a patch.
 
     6.  Non-ARPA problems should be reported via the SPR mechanism.  DDT     
         patches generated for these problems will be for the current field    
         image TOPS-20 release and will not be available as TCP/IP source (or  
         DDT) updates until the next source update.
 
     Maintenance will continue in this way until the shipment of TOPS-20 V6.0. 
     This interim availability and support of TCP/IP is to meet the 
     requirements of ARPAnet.  The TCP/IP software is still very much in a 
     test and evaluation status.  It may not have the quality of a field 
     tested product.  Sites which do not have a requirement for features are 
     encouraged to continue to utilize the supported field image release.
 
TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT:
 
     This test will be terminated with the release of TOPS-20 V6.0.  TCP/IP 
     will be made fully supported by this release.  It is expected that by 
     this time, customers will have converted all their utilities to use the 
     Digital JSYS interface and not the BB&N interface.  Thus the major 
     modification will be that the BB&N JSYS interface will be removed.  This 
     will make the product more reliable and easier to maintain.
