Subject: TCP/IP for Unix v7
From: BNL at BBNC
To: TCP-IP at BRL

Two independent requests:

1) Does anyone have a public domain implementation of TCP/IP for
Unix v7? (Don't laugh, conventional wisdom to the contrary I have
not been able to locate one!)

2) Does there exist VDH code for the above, or that is adaptable to it?

Subject: VDH (Gasp!)
To:      Tcp-Ip at BRL

I have just finished perusing the archive of the TCP-IP list and have
not gotten any clues about whether anyone has or will have a UNIX
IP/TCP implementation that runs VDH.  Yale is connected VDH to the
IMP at Harvard so we are very interested in the status of any VDH
work.

Does anyone have any information on the subject?

Subject:   Re:  PDP11/45 UNIX IP/TCP

I know of three TCP/IP implementations for UNIX, all of which could
potentially fit on an 11/45:

1)  BBN all-user-mode TCP/IP.  Requires many BBN kernel hacks for
asynchronous I/O, etc.  Best price:  free.  Seems to be fairly slow.
Also reputed to be somewhat buggy.  Not used by BBN for some time.

2)  3Com's UNET package.  Kernel mode IP, user mode TCP.  Supposed to
"drop in" to V7 kernels.  Price $5K, performance believed to be very
good, in excess of 200Kbits/sec user-user throughput in early
benchmarks.  May not track ArpaNet version of protocols though.

3)  MIT LCS ringnet project.  Kernel IP, user TCP.  Status and
availibility uncertain.  Progressing fast, but just now
getting TCP running at all.  Speed at least 50Kbits/sec user-user,
full potential rather better than that, but not measured yet.

For your information the NAVY and SRI are (jointly) taking path #1,
BRL is taking paths #2 and #3 simultaneously, and other parts of
the ARMY are taking path #2.  I will report on BRL's results with
the 3Com and MIT software as soon as we have anything to say.

Mike,

	Here, at last, is the information you requested about
our TCP/IP-based "ACCESS-T" product:

DTI VAX/VMS

 Date:	12 Mar 1982
 From:	John Schur <schur at dti-vms>

This TCP implementation is written in C for the VMS operating
system. It uses ACP's for the TCP and IP processes, and supports
user level interfaces to these ACP's.

The implementation fully conforms to the TCP and IP specifications
(RFC 791, 793)  and ICMP (RFC 792). Higher level protocol 
services include user and server TELNET, FTP, and SMTP.

1. Hardware - VAX 11/780 or 11/750 running VMS 2.2 or later,
	and ACC LH/DH-11 interface (other devices will be
	supported in future according to user interest).

2. Software - written in mostly C and some MACRO. Supports a 
	user-definable number of connections.

3. Status - TCP/IP ACP's are currently in testing stages,
	with field test sites to begin use in April.

4. Protocol Features Supported:
	IP:
	    Fragmentation/Reassembly: reassembly is supported,
		but fragmentation is not implemented.

	    Options: all options are generated and interpreted.

	    Reassembly timeout: fixed value. Oldest fragments
		are discarded first when buffers fill up.

	TCP:
	    Options: All defined options are implemented.

	    Urgent, Push: Supported as per specifications.

	    Retransmission: Timeouts employ exponential backoff
		until a limit is reached, at which time user is
		notified.

	    Window strategy: Window size is larger than the actual
		available buffer space by the maximum size of an
		internal buffer.

Please contact DTI for further information.

Xerox Network Systems protocols can be obtained  by writing to:

   Xerox Corporation
   Office Products Division
   Network Systems Administration Office
   3333 Coyote Hill Road
   Palo Alto, California  94304

I have two such protocol manuals.  They are:
  
   1)  Internet Transport Protocols  XSIS 028112
   2)  Courier:  The Remote Procedure Call Protocol    XSIS 038112

Both of which are dated December, 1981.  (Probably hence the xx8112 in the
title, which suggests there is an XSIS 018112, but I don't know.)  In any
case, there probably are other publications on the protocols, get the info
from the Network Systems Administration Office.

For more details, Bob Printis at the Palo Alto facility ( (415) 494-4000 )
is involved in the actual implementation.  DO NOT call him just to request
information, but if you have a detailed technical question . . .

SUBJECT: Service Specifications
Via:  Ucb-C70; 1 Apr 82 2:09-EDT

       I am a member of	the IEEE project 802 High Level	Interface
       subcommittee (HILI).  One of our	concerns is a specification
       of the service provided by the link layer to the	network
       layer.  Our model of interface interaction is based on
       primitives.  These are discrete,	instantaneous interface
       events which convey the information required in order to
       provide a particular service.  This is the same as the model
       that ISO	uses in	their service specifications.  However,	we
       differ from ISO in several important ways, and I	would like
       to solicit comments from	the newsgroup about them.

       The ISO (ISO/TC 97/SC 16	N697) transport	service
       specification uses the "four arrow model" of service
       primitive interaction.  For example, the	user layer passes a
       "CONNECT.request" primitive to the serving layer	to request
       that a connection be set	up.  The serving layer then passes
       an "CONNECT.indication" primitive to the	remote user layer
       to indicate the connection attempt.  The	remote user layer
       evaluates this and then passes a	"CONNECT.response"
       primitive to the	serving	layer to accept	or deny	the
       connection.  The	serving	then passes a "CONNECT.confirm"
       primitive to the	original user layer to convey the results
       of the connection attempt.

	  local	    |	serving	   |   remote
	user layer  |	 layer	   | user layer
		    |		   |
	  --------->|		   |
	   request  |		   |
		    |		   |------------>
		    |		   | indication
		    |		   |
		    |		   |<------------
		    |		   | response
	  <---------|		   |
	   confirm  |		   |
		    |		   |

       The HILI	committee uses a "three	arrow model".  For example,
       the "CONNECT.request" and "CONNECT.indication" are the same
       as above.  However, after the "CONNECT.indication" is passed
       to the remote user layer, the serving layer passes a
       "CONNECT.response" to the original user layer.  Thus the
       purpose of the response primitive is convey to the original
       user layer whether or not an indication primitive was sent
       to its peer.  (The name "response" is unfortunate since it
       conflicts with the ISO primitive, but we	couldn't think of a
       better one)

	  local	    |	serving	   |   remote
	user layer  |	 layer	   | user layer
		    |		   |
	  --------->|		   |
	   request  |		   |
		    |		   |------------>
		    |		   | indication
	  <---------|		   |
	   response |		   |
		    |		   |

       The HILI	committee feels	that the three arrow model is more
       appropriate because:

	 1.  It	makes the layers more independent, because the
	     serving layer does	not have to depend on or wait for
	     the remote	user layer to respond to an indication
	     primitive.

	 2.  The "four arrow model" interaction	is actually a user
	     layer protocol and	should not be the business of the
	     serving layer.  In	the example the	acceptance or
	     rejection of a peer connection is a user layer
	     protocol.	If the remote peer wishes to reject the
	     connection	it should do so	with a user layer PDU
	     and/or disconnect the serving layer connection.  The
	     purpose of	the serving layer should be to set up a
	     communication pipe	between	the "bottoms" of the two
	     user layers.  It should not say whether the user of
	     the pipe accepted the data	or not.

If people want to discuss this on the net thats fine,
otherwise sent comments to me:

IBM ADOPTS TCP
"Tired of Trying to Physicalize Virtual Resources"

4/1/82. Old Teddybear, N.Y. (AFP)  In an unprecedented bout of
corporate clarity, SNA was publicly renounced by the entire
IBM Board of Directors, clad in off-blue sackcloth.  "What a gas,"
said a spokesman for the Ethernet Consortium, while a DECNET
representative was still looking for a few extra cards.  DOD
spokesmen declined immediate comment, indicating that they wanted
time to reassess their position in light of IBM's new posture.
