Subject: TCP/IP "Press Package"

Einar Stefferud <Stef@KA> and Vint Cerf <Cerf@usc-isi> have come up with
the idea of putting together a TCP/IP "Press Package" which we could feed
to Datamation and IBM and everybody else who ought to hear about TCP/IP,
but maybe hasn't.  This would be mostly a cut-and-paste job done to some
of the existing RFCs and IENs, along with descriptive text from previous
digests, and new contributions.  If you submitted something which was
published in a previous digest, and you would not mind having it become
part of the Press Package, please send me a note -- only contributions
specifically designated for public distribution will be included in
the press package.  The same holds true for all new submissions to the
Digest.  Only clearly marked letters will be added to the press package
file;  all others go to the digest only.

Also, anybody who would like to contribute (USMAIL) addresses of people
who ought to get the press package should send them to TCP-IP-Request.

				Thoughts?

Subject: Protocol Documents

It might be helpful to have a list of the documents that specify the
protocols to be used in the TCP environment.

These documents can be copied as public access files from the Network
Information Center Library on the SRI-NIC ARPANET host. The FTP pathname
for a file is <NETINFO>RFCxxx.TXT or <NETINFO>IEN-xxx.TXT where the xxx
is the document number (note the dash in the IEN file names, and no dash
in the RFC file names).  These files can be copied via FTP using the FTP
username ANONYMOUS and password GUEST.

Subject: ARPANET "link" vs "message-id"

With a TCP/IP implementation on ARPANET, the use of the "link" field
in the 1822 leader to identify Internet Protocol precludes the use of
the "message-ID" field for multiplexing independent data streams
between hosts.  It seems that we're reduced to a send message -- wait
for RFNM (or msg type 7-9) before another message can be sent to the
same host.  An alternative, of course, is to ignore RFNM's and let the
higher-level TCP layer handle all retransmissions and let the local
IMP block output from the host after 8 messages.  Am I missing something
or is there to be an RFC replacing the Report 1822 (May 1978 revision)?

Subject: FTP server replies/ (commands)

It appears that most server FTPs use a "255 SOCK port no." reply (command ?).
Where is this documented? I see no mention of this command in RFC764 nor
in the older RFC542 (Arpanet Protocol Handbook, NIC 7104-jan78).
 
The Air Force Systems Command FTP server (SAMNET) for PDP11 RSX11M also
issues the "255 SOCK port no." but always for the default port no. SAMNET
user FTP, assuming all servers will speak on the default port, issues
his "ACCEPT CONNECTION" for the server default port (actually before
issuing his STOR or RETR). FTP servers, such as UNIX and more recently
TOPS20, which issue the SOCK reply (COMMAND ?) for other than the default
port cause us problems. ( SAMNET user FTP times out--DATA connection not
established--).
 
After studying RFC793 (TCP) and RFC764 (FTP) , I am concerned this problem
will follow us to TCP/IP. Is there an RFC that describes "SOCK". 
My interpretation of RFC764 is - server FTP does not issue Commands only
replies and is therefore bound to speak on the DEFAULT PORT. I would
appreciate some comments from the ARPANET community and Protocol designers
on this subject.

Calvin:

Nice to hear from you, and learn of your interest in FTP. You concern for
function to switch off the default data socket (or port in TCP) is well taken,
it is an important function.

I think you had a typo in your message.  You referred to RFC 764 as being
the FTP document for use of FTP on TCP.  Actually the FTP document is
RFC 765 (RFC 764 is the Telnet document).

In RFC 765, there is both a PORT command, and a 227 reply, to support the
selection of a non-default data connection.  There is a brief example of
the scenario on page 41.

You are correct in suggesting that there have been implementation problems
with this procedure in the past.  I think the new description (in RFC 765)
is clear enough that much of the past misunderstandings can be eliminated.

In fact, the documentation of the old NCP based FTP is in a poor state. This
is due to the fact that several of the implementations were based on early
versions of the specification and were not updated to match later 
specifications.  A measure of the confusion that existed can be seen from a
review of RFC 691 which compares two sets of FTP reply codes.

We expect that the past confusion and problems can be left behind as we move
to TCP, with a clearer specification of the FTP procedure.

Thanks again for letting me know your concern.

Subject: TCP in Ratfor

    Mike O'Dell from LBL-UNIX stated that we (teklabs) have written a
TCP in ratfor for Cybers.  That is not quite right.  We have written a
TCP for Cybers in SYMPL (CDC's systems language), a subset of JOVIAL.

    We have been running it for several monbths, and it works well.
Also, Clem Cole in not working at Tek right now, he is attending a
Phd program at Berkely.

From: teklabs!michaele at Berkeley
Subject: Teklabs tcp/ip

    It has been stated that Teklab is writing a version of TCP in Ratfor.
That is not true.  Teklabs has implemeted TCP/IP on a Cyber 175. The
TCP is written in SYMPL, CDC's systems language; IP is written in PP
assembler.  Teklabs is in the process of implementing TCP/IP for VMS and
TOPS.  The TCP is being written in BLISS, and IP will be written in the
appropriate assembler.

    The Cyber version of TCP/IP has been up for several months and works
very well.  The VMS version should be up within a month.  The TOPS version
should be up in about three or four months.  For more information, you can
contact Tim Fallon (Project Leader) at
ucbvax!teklabs!timf, or Rick Krull (implementation programmer) at
ucbvax!teklabs!rickk.

    My familiarity with the network comes from helping Tim and Rick
with The Cyber Systems interface, and doing some small amount of
testing for/with them.

Have a good One!

Subject:   Discussion of SMTP in TCP Digest?

	Because SMTP is one of the "protocols" that is comming with
the TCP/IP package, the TCP Digest seems a good place for this discussion.
It certainly will hit all the designers and implementors, which is good.
You should probably CC MSGGroup or HeaderPeople or whoever else seems
appropriate, but I know of no other list that does any better.  (Of course,
there are probably a few lists bouncing around that I have never run into.
If you find a better forum, please let me know).

Subject: Meta-meta-discussion

I agree that the meta-discussion should be moved to a more appropriate
list, although I have no suggestions for which list is appropriate.  I
have found the TCP/IP discussions to be most interesting, as we are
presently implementing (yet another) version of IP and TCP for UNIX
here.

In regard to this, I have a question about the SMTP protocol as documented
in RFC788.  There appears to be no way for the SMTP user process to abort
a transaction once it has begun to send the data portion of a message.  Is
this correct, or am I simply missing something?

Subject:  *** Spoiler Warning ***   ---   DECNET and UNIX

Bill Shannon at DEC asked me to publish his UNIX/DECNET Communications Survey
in the digest so that it would reach the most number of people.  In light
of his comments below, I felt that this would not be inappropriate, although
a little off the usual topic.  Networking is networking.

The next two messages are the last in this Digest.  Those of you who who
are not interested in DECNET or UNIX can stop here.

Subject: Re:  DECnet/Unix Survey

I sent it to tcp-ip so that if you felt it was appropriate you
could include it in the digest.  If you followed any of the
discussion in net.news recently some people have expressed a
concern that Usenet (and even more so Arpanet) is not the right
place to do something like that.  I of course disagree but for
different reasons than most other people.  I think I needed to
emphasize more that the survey was not done by DEC-the-corporation
as a prelude to coming out with a product, but by Bill-Shannon-a-
member-of-the-DEC-Unix-Engineering-Group before I spend my time
working on such a project.  Of course there would be nothing to
prevent DEC from turning it into a product but that was not the
intent.

Subject: DECnet/Unix Survey

The DEC Unix Engineering Group is considering doing some work
to provide some DECnet capability for Unix.  To make sure that
we do something useful (if we do anything!), we'd like to get
some feedback as to what people would like.  A survey form is
included, please return directly to me with your comments. 
Any general interest messages can be sent directly to the net.

===============================================================================

			DECnet/Unix Survey

1.  Do you require a supported product?  Must it be supported by DEC?

2.  How much would you be willing to pay for both supported and unsupported?

3.  What version(s) of Unix should it run on?  Is VMUNIX enough?  V7?  S3?

4.  Would you be willing to buy hardware (eg, a front end), to support DECnet?

5.  Do you need to talk to all DEC systems, or would VMS be enough?

6.  Is Phase III end-node capability enough, or do you require routing?

7.  What hardware support do you require?  Is DMC/DMR enough?

8.  Is X.25 support required?

9.  Which of the following capabilities do you require: file transfer, mail,
    virtual terminals, transparent remote file access?

10. Should it be integrated with any other Unix networking capability, e.g.,
    Arpanet, uucp, Berknet, or should it be entirely separate?

11. Anything else you would like to say?

Please return to decvax!shannon@Berkeley.
