To:   George at AFSC-HQ

C. K. Norris:

The link field is defined to be the high-order eight bits of the twelve 
bit message-id field defined in the 1822 protocol.  The link field is 
used to distinguish between different host level protocols used in the 
ARPANET (e.g., NCP, IP, NVP; see RFC 790 page 10).  IP uses link 155 
(decimal).  

In the normal case the the low-order four bits of the message-id field 
are sent as zeros and are ignored on reception.  Several times in the 
past the idea of using those bits to identify specific messages has been
put forward (e.g., RFC 534, RFC 663), but there has not been a real 
requirement for that level of error control (the ARPANET is very 
reliable).

There is a misconception in your message about the "IMP Blocking".  The 
IMP will block the transmission of a message to a destination host when 
ever there are eight messages in transit to that particular host.  That 
is, the blocking is on a source host to destination host pair basis, and
independent of what links or message-ids or higher level protocols are 
used.  Also, please note, that the eight messages in transit is an upper
bound, and that the IMP may block the host at a lower number if 
resources are not available.  Once a host is blocked, it can't send 
messages to any destination.  The block is cleared when one of the in 
transit messages is delivered and the RFNM (or other response) is 
returned, or more IMP resouces become available.

A proposal for a more flexible interface called "1822L" has been 
circulated as RFC 802 (Nov-81).  The 1822L interface provides for a 
"short-blocking" operation, and for logical addressing in the ARPANET.  
My understanding is that BBN is currently implementing this proposal, so
any comments should be sent to the author (Malis@BBN-UNIX) at once.

RFCs may be copied from the Network Information Center online library at
SRI-NIC via FTP using the FTP username ANONYMOUS and password GUEST.  
The file pathnames are of the form <NETINFO>RFC802.TXT.  Unfortunately, 
some old RFCs are not online any more and some old old RFCs never were. 
If you really need a RFC that is not online send a message to 
NIC@SRI-NIC requesting what you need.

Larry Allen:

You are correct.  There is no way in SMTP to cancel the message once the
DATA command is issued.  The only way out is to break the connection.

This is true in the current ARPANET mail system, and I am not aware that
any serious problems occur brcause of it.

Subject:  SMTP

	There was recently a discussion about the problems of "@"'s and
"."s in SMTP addresses and routes, and it was considered bad, because some
hosts have special meanings for those characters in user-names or mailboxes.
	Well, no matter what character we pick, some joker will always want
to use it on his system for something special. It seems to me this problem is
understood. Anything in an SMTP route or address is to be interpreted only by
SMTP. If we want SMTP to pass it on to the local system, then we have an SMTP
special character that says just that: quote the next charcetr.
	What is wrong with introducing a quote character into SMTP? In
order for something to be interpreted by a host with  any meaning local to his
system, it must be preceded by the quote symbol. (That includes the quote
symbol!)
	Comments?

Subject:  Validation of reverse path in SMTP

	I think that SMTP servers should validate the reverse-path before
accepting the MAIL command. Right now there is not really a Reply Code for
that that MAIL expects (501 is sort of right, but we want to give something
that says "Mailbox Syntax Incorrect". Maybe a 553?)
	Anyway, it is useful to check this because you may have to use that
reverse-path, (I mean that's the idea of it, isn't it?), and if it doesn't
mean anything to you then it is useless. The time to check it is when you get
it.
	And yes, I think it possible that you can get badly formed
reverse-paths. I already have. Hosts tack on a local name for themselves at
the end, that we don't understand.
	Any comments?

                      DoD Protocol Standardization

The attached memoranda from the Principal Deputy Undersecretary of
Defense for Research and Engineering and from the Assistant Secretary of
Defense (Communications, Command, Control and Intelligence) describe the
DoD plans for standardizing internet protocols.  The first two are the
Internet Protocol and the Transmnission Control Protocol.

The DARPA Internet project will continue to provide technical support
for the DoD standardization effort, including the test and evaluation of
selected proposed standards.

SUBJECT:  Host-to-Host Protocols for Data Communications Networks

A number of data communications networks are operating or under
development within DoD, without adequate provisions for
interoperability.  AUTODIN II is expected to become operational during
FY 1980, to provide common-user data communications service for DoD
computer systems and permit a reduction in the number of specialized
data networks.  Plans are under way to incorporate within AUTODIN II
networks such as the WWMCCS Intercomputer Network (WIN), Intelligence
Data Handling System Communications (IDHSC) and the SAC Digital Network
(SACDIN), among others.  Local networks such as the Community On-Line
Intelligence Network System (COINS) and certain tactical networks must
have effective AUTODIN II interfaces.

AUTODIN II will provide connectivity for a wide range of systems, but
the potential for information exchange beyond narrowly defined
communities will be limited without appropriate standards for internet,
host-to-host, terminal-to-host and other protocols.  As the need to
exchange information across network boundaries increases, lack of common
protocols standards will become a formidable barrier to
interoperability.  Techniques in which the protocols of one network are
translated into the protocols of another will become increasingly
unworkable as the number of protocols and networks requiring
interoperation increases.

To insure interoperability of future data networking, I am directing the
adoption of a set of DoD standard host-to-host protocols based on the
Transmission Control and Internet Protocols (TCP/IP version 4) developed
in the DARPA/DCA internetwork community.  DoD requirements for
precedence, security, and community of interest controls will be
incorporated within the standard protocol set.  Use of these protocols
will be MANDATORY for all packet-oriented data networks where there is a
potential for host-to-host connectivity across network or subnetwork
boundaries.  Case-by-case exceptions will be granted only for networks
that can be shown to have no future requirements for interoperability.
Because the host-to-host protocol being developed for AUTODIN II evolved
from an early version of TCP and is unsuitable for internetwork
operation, the AUTODIN II TCP will have to be upgraded to the standard
protocol set.  Recognizing that there may be cost and schedule impacts
on the AUTODIN II program, the Defense Communications Agency should
perform a cost tradeoff analysis to determine the optimum time for this
transition.  DCA should provide the results of this analysis by April
1979.

To address these and future protocol issues and promulgate appropriate
standards, I am forming an OSD Protocol Standards Working Group chaired
by the Director, Information Systems.  I ask each addressee to nominate
a representative.  Names should be provided by 8 January 1979 to LTC
Wilcox (695-3287).  The first task of this group will be to finalize
details of the standard host-to-host protocol set.  Draft specifications
for these protocols will be available in January 1979.  Final
specifications should be distributed by April 1979 following review by
the working group and testing by DCA and DARPA.  At that time, I expect
to promulgate these standards and set dates for their adoption.

The Defense Communications Agency is designated as DoD Executive Agent
for computer communications protocols and will manage the implementation
and development and evolution of standard host-to-host protocols, as
designated by the Protocol Standards Working Group.  The DCA will
forward to this office within 120 days a management plan for carrying
out this role.

SUBJECT:  Host-to-Host Data Communications Protocols

The revised Management Plan for Standardizatioan of Host-to-Host Data
Communications Protocols (enclosure 1) is approved.  The plan has been
modified to emphasize DCA's direct responsibilities as Executive Agent.

The DoD Standard Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol
Specifications (enclosure 2) are hereby ratified.  Use of these
protocols is MANDATORY for all packet-oriented data networks where there
is a potential for host-to-host connectivity across network or
subnetwork boundaries.  In order to facilitate rapid implementation of
these protocols on DoD networks, the Defense Communications Agency, as
part of its Executive Agent role, will prepare a series of
workshop/seminars and implementation support documents to assist the DoD
activities in implementing these protocols.  The AUTODIN II
implementation of these protocol standards will take place as soon after
AUTODIN II IOC as possible.

I would like to thank all those who participated in the OSD Protocol
Standards Working Group during the past year.  That Working Group is
hereby disestablished and its responsibilities are transferred to the
various DCA panels as defined in the Executive Agent Charter.

Subject: Sperry Univac TCP-IP Implementation
From: TMPL at BBNG
To: TCP-IP at BRL

I have just learned that we are in the  process  of  implementing
TCP-IP  on  the  Sperry Univac DCP-40 Communications Processor on
behalf  of  NUSC,  for  connection  to  the  ARPAnet,  completion
approximately  January  1983.  I was called by George Blankenship
of our Federal Systems operations in McLean, Va.,  who  has  been
reading  the  Digest.  He would like me to ask the Digest readers
if  anyone  knows  of  anyone  else  (outside  Univac)   who   is
implementing TCP-IP for Sperry Univac systems.
