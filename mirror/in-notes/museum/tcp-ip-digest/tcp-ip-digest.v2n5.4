Subject:  The Purpose of the TCP-Digest

Just in case you were wondering what this is all about...

	The TCP Digest is a moderated network mailing list.  Sort of a
"do it yourself Letters-to-the-Editor" column.

	The audience is fairly large, mostly protocol implementors,
system managers, communications specialists, various types of management,
and some onlookers.  The intention is to have a forum to discuss
implementation details and current problems of networking (especially
the Dod Standard TCP/IP), in a much more concrete fashion than the often
"blue sky" HUMAN-NETS Digest.

	Keep those cards (ugh) and letters comming!

From: Gail Rubin <grubin@Bbn-Unix.ARPA>
Subject: VAX Arpanet software
To: TCP-IP@BRL

The company mentioned in Joel Goldberger's message, DTI, has changed its
name  to  Compion. We (BBN) are currently running their software on some
of our VMS systems - the version for VMS >3. It sounds much better  than
the  version  Joel  used,  but  it  still  has a few problems - the most
serious ones are in ftp. When running from the vms  as  a  host,  it  is
incredibly slow - you should always run it from the other machine (if it
isn't also a vms!). This may be just the way things are  with  VMS,  I'm
not sure this is something Compion can get around.  Also in ftp, you can
only GET one file from vms at a time - subsequent files give  you  error
messages  so  you  have  to  re-establish  the connection for each file.
Compion is working on these problems; they have already fixed one  other
problem  that we reported to them.  On our vax unix machines here we run
our own software - that of Rob Gurwitz of our company, as also mentioned
in  Joel's  message.  The  hardware  is  the  same in both cases - ACC's
LHDH-11.

[ Due to the "Maximum Distribution Requested" on the front of this, I am
  reproducing portions of the DEFENSE DATA NETWORK NEWSLETTER here which
  concern subscription and information-distribution details, for those
  who may not have seen this in a direct mailing.  For those who don't
  have ARPANET access, the NIC may be telephoned at (415)-859-3695.  -Mike ]

                       DEFENSE DATA NETWORK NEWSLETTER

   (Maximum Distribution Requested.  The DDN Newsletter is published by the 
   Network Information Center under DCA contract.  For subscription, contact
   NIC@SRI-NIC.  Back issues obtainable by FTP from the directory <DDN-NEWS>
   at SRI-NIC [10.0.0.73].)

SUBSCRIPTIONS WANTED.

Along with the change in name and format, the DDN Newsletter gains a greatly 
expanded role as the official means by which the DDN Program Management Office 
communicates with DDN and ARPANET users.  To this end, a significant increase
in circulation is sought.  Two means of accomplishing this are feasible.

The first means of increasing circulation is by remailing at the host level.
This clearly is the more efficient method, and avoids building the mailing list
at the NIC into something unmanageable.  Host Administrators and Technical
Liaison personnel are therefore requested, where feasible, to remail the DDN 
Newsletter to all account holders on their host.  Remailing is particularly 
solicited for this edition of the DDN-NEWS.

The second means is by direct mailing from the NIC.  Although not the desired 
approach, an increase in size of the NIC mailing list is feasible within 
limits.  Users with accounts at hosts which cannot provide remailing of the 
newsletter may, therefore, obtain a copy directly from the NIC by submitting a 
request for subscription directly to NIC@SRI-NIC.

DDN-DIGEST.

Our thanks to Steve Nelson and Pete Vayda for their timely and excellent
suggestion that we begin a DDN-DIGEST, similar to the TCP-IP Digest published
by Mike Muuss, to keep you, the users, informed about the DDN and to get 
feedback from you as well.  To this end, we have established the mailbox 
DDN-NEWS@SRI-NIC to receive questions, comments, and the like which you want
to send us.  These we will incorporate in the UNOFFICIAL section of the 
Newsletter (allowing for duplication) along with an answer from an appropriate
person.  More on this in future Newsletters, but in the meanwhile, the mailbox
is there and ready for your use.
