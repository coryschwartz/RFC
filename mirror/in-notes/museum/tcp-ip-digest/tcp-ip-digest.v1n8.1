Subject: TCP/IP for CDC CYBER Mainframes
From: SITNIK at OFFICE-8

Tektronix has implemented TCP/IP on their CDC CYBER mainframe.
The project is being directed by Tim Fallon, (415) 627-5471.  Tim
doesn't mind being contacted and in fact, would like to
distribute TCP to anyone who is interested with the understanding
that there is no committment of future support by Tektronix.  He
is currently exploring the distribution issue with the Tektronix
legal department.

The Tektronix implementation of TCP/IP runs at a System Control
Point (SCP) under the NOS operating system.  Interface with the
user is through SCP macro calls.  Interface to the network is via
a Hyperchannel device drive which runs in a peripheral processor.

Tim is not aware of anyone working on a NOS/BE version of TCP.

Subject: mail among tcp/ncp hosts

A while ago, the following question was asked and I didn't see an
answer to it in this digest.  Can someone answer it.  Thanks.

As TCP/IP becomes the standard, many hosts are coming online with
only TCP/IP protocols.  Can someone explain where and how one uses
mail gateways to get mail to/from hosts which are using NCP
protocols with those using TCP/IP protocols while the transition
is taking place?

--charley

[ I believe that the plan for transition is well detailed in RFC801,
  which is availible for FTP from the NIC using account "anonymous",
  and your name for the password.  File is <netinfo>rfc801.txt
  I have included pieces here for everybody to see.   -Mike ]

Subject:  RFC801 Excerpts about NCP <-> TCP Mail and File Transfer

Network Working Group                                          J. Postel
Request for Comments: 801                                            ISI

      For FTP, there will be provided one or more relay hosts.  An FTP
      relay host will implement both the NCP and TCP environments, both
      user and server Telnet, and both user and server FTP in both
      environments.  Users requiring FTP service between hosts in
      different environments will first connect via Telnet to an FTP
      relay host, then use FTP to move the file from the file donor host
      to the FTP relay host, and finally use FTP to move the file from
      the FTP relay host to the file acceptor host.  (See Appendix B.)

      For Mail, hosts will implement the new Simple Mail Transfer
      Protocol (SMTP) described in RFC 788.  The SMTP procedure provides
      for relaying mail among several protocol environments.  For
      TCP-only hosts, using SMTP will be sufficient.  For NCP-only hosts
      that have not been modified to use SMTP, the special syntax
      "user.host@forwarder" may be used to relay mail via one or more
      special forwarding host.  Several mail relay hosts will relay mail
      via SMTP procedures between the NCP and TCP environments, and at
      least one special forwarding host will be provided.

Subject:   Relating ArpaNet Protocols to the ISO Reference Model

Whilst reading a copy of "FY80 Final Report:  Cable Bus Applications
in Command Centers" from the Mitre Corporation which was kindly provided
to me by Steve Holmgren <Steve@Mitre>, I discovered a most interesting
comparison between the TCP/IP based ArpaNet, and the ISO Reference Model.
Included is basically the following picture:

    ISO Reference Model	|    ArpaNet Environment
------------------------|-------------------------------------
	Application	|
------------------------|
	Presentation	|	Virtual Terminal Protocol
------------------------|
	Session		|-------------------------------------
------------------------|
	Transport	|	Transmission Control Protocol/
------------------------|	     InterNet Protocol
	Network		|-------------------------------------
------------------------|
	Data-Link Cntrl	|	Variety of Low-Level Network
------------------------|	     Access Mechanisms
	Physical	|
------------------------|-------------------------------------

Also there is the following descriptive text:

"At the lower protocol levels there is no natural intersection of the
DARPA-like architectures with the ISO Reference Model (RM), but
above layer four in the RM and the end-to-end transport layer in
the DARPA model an eventual mergins of models is possible.

TCP contains some session layer mechanisms and our Virtual Terminal
Protocol (VTP) contains both session and presentation functions, but
the splitting out of these functions in the VTP model is possible and
would not significantly change the protocol itself.  Naturally, a VTP
that fits within the open systems architecture would need to utilize
certain data transformation services of the presentation layer and data
transfer controlling services of the session layer.  This could be done
by using appropriately constructed presentation and session protocols."

Milestones							When
----------							----

   First Internet Service                                        already

      A few hosts are TCP-capable and use TCP-based services.

   First TCP-only Host                                           already

      The first TCP-only host begins use of TCP-based services.

   Telnet and FTP Relay Service                                  already

      Special relay accounts are available to qualified users with a
      demonstrated need for the Telnet or FTP relay service.

   Ad Hoc Mail Relay Service                                     already

      An ad hoc mail relay service using the prototype MTP (RFC 780) is
      implemented and mail is relayed from the TCP-only hosts to
      NCP-only hosts, but not vice versa.  This service will be replaced
      by the SMTP service.

   Last NCP Conversion Begins                                     Jan 82

      The last NCP-only host begins conversion to TCP.

   Mail Relay Service                                             Jan 82

      The SMTP (RFC 788) mail service begins to operate and at least one
      mail relay host is operational, and at least one special forwarder
      is operational to provide NCP-only host to TCP-only host mail
      connectivity.

   Normal Internet Service                                        Jul 82

      Most hosts are TCP-capable and use TCP-based services.

   Last NCP Conversion Completed                                  Nov 82

      The last NCP-only host completes conversion to TCP.

   Full Internet Service                                          Jan 83

      All hosts are TCP-capable and use TCP-based services.  NCP is
      removed from service, relay services end, all services are
      TCP-based.

Mike,

There is a lot of things one can say about the INDRA project.  What level, and
what length interests you.  The project has been going in some form for
eight years, and we are deeply involved in providing services for UK groups
to have terminal, file   and mail connectiviity with US groups who are
both on ARPANET or TElENET in the US, and on SRCNET or PSS in the UK. Thus
the project is like CSNET, but also as a considerable research congent.

We are active in various Internet and satelite projects as well.
