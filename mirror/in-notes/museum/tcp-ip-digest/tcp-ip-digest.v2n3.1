To: tcp-ip@Brl.ARPA, dan@Sri-Tsc.ARPA

I inquired about this a long time ago, to all the mailing lists I could
think of including Unix-Wizards and Info-Vax.  The silence was deafening.
An ECC from ACC is the only way to go.  (Two of these boxes at either
end of a transmission line of arbitrary length make each end think it
is talking a LH/DH protocol.)

[ Actually, one alternative to consider is an HDH (HDLC Distant Host)
  connection to the IMP.  ACC has a UNIBUS interface for HDH, and
  Rob Gurwitz of BBN is reported to be building a driver.  HDH uses
  the same type of access lines as VDH did (synchronous modems),
  and is less expensive than ECUs.  As HDH is still brand new, there
  may be some bugs left to find for a little while.  -Mike ]

To: TCP-IP@Brl.ARPA

Does anyone know of a TCP/IP implementation which will run under UNIX
V7 or 2.xBSD on an LSI-11/23?  The machine will be used as a network
print server on a 10Mb Ethernet using a specialized user-level
protocol, so no protocol software is necessary, although some flavor of
FTP would be nice during the development phase.

[ The only PDP-11 UNIX implementations I know of fit only into split-I/D
  PDP-11s, although the MIT-CSR one might fit, as might the early
  "all in user code" TCP implementations.  -Mike ]

Subject: tcp on 68000's
To: tcp-ip@Brl.ARPA

Unisoft has ported the UCB IP/TCP code to UNIX System III running on
various incarnations of the 68000.  The kernel code running now is derived,
in truth, from the Croft port of 4.1a+ to the pdp-11.  User programs
running now are rcp, rlogin, and mail -- based on "delivermail".

Buffer-to- buffer performance to date:

	Ethernet, 3com multibus controllers, 2 8-mhz "Sun"-type cpu boards,
	on-board memory (no wait-states).

	With Checksums		580,000+ bits/sec.
	Without Checksums	680,000+ bits/sec.

Future plans:  Merge in UCB 4.1c/4.2 kernel changes; bring up arpa standard
ftp, telnet, mail;  Bring up various random hacks such as rwho, etc.

We have experienced no "stuttering", a recent complaint about this code when
it runs on the 11 -- but of course we aren't on the Arpanet (sigh).

This code will be available to all oem's of Unisoft, some of which include
Wicat, Codata, Dual, Pixel, Callan, Corvus, Cosmos, CYB, Heurikon, Ampex,
Microbar, Megadata, Momentum, NCR, Pacific Micro, Victory, Xyvision.  Sun
Microsystems is an oem of Unisoft also; rumor has it that they have
some networking software of their own.

Whether any of these companies choose to make this code available to their
customers is up to the companies.

To:       tcp-ip at BRL-VGR
Subject:  XNS:  A Real Standard?

Recently, a very good question was raised about XNS,
Xerox's new network protocol:

	"Is XNS becoming the commercial [network] standard?"

Two statements about this question were made that bear repeating
(published by permission):

Chris Kent <CAK@Purdue> said:

	"XNS may well become a standard for Ethernet based networks;
	 what happens when you want to talk to someone else?"

Chris Ryland <CPR@MIT-XX> said:

	"Yes, it does appear that XNS is gaining the momentum needed
	 to become a true standard (vs. a paper standard).  I say this
	 because there are a lot of companies offering or about to offer
	 XNS-based networks (Network Research, ACC, 3Com, Bridge, are
	 a few)."

I would like to see a discussion of:

1)  the technical merits of XNS -vs- TCP/IP, and
2)  some speculation on their futures in the commercial arena

in future issues of the TCP Digest ("The INTERNET Digest").

				Best,
