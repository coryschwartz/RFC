Subject: for TCP-IP digest

I would like to obtain information from anyone who has (or knows of)
a TCP-IP implementation for RSX11-M, the machine in question
is an 11/70. Any help gratefully received.

[TCP] TELNET is available on all ISI hosts; FTP is available on the
VAX and is being worked on for the TOPS-20 by BBN (Charles Lynn).

A list of TCP-capable hosts is in [ISIF]<internet-notebook>TCP-IP-STATUS.TXT.

TN runs on the TOPS-20 ("TelNet") and can be used to go from ISIC to
the VAX.

Vint
The file at ISIF is in need of updating - Jon Postel will be pulsing
the TCP implementers for new info, but you may find the current version
of some interst.

	MMDF- swd has done some looking into it as well, and thinks
	it's the way to go.  We've heard from farber and crocker at
	udel that we will probably be the next csnet site to go online,
	so we'll be getting the most up-to-date version of MMDF
	sometime this month (or maybe early December).

I'm rapidly coming to that conclusion as well, and the sooner I see
some manuals and some code, the happier I'll be.  I just read RFC754
and RFC799, and it's becoming apparent that the ARPAnuts are setting
standards which we'll have to adhere to if we're to talk to them.  And
the whole uucp addressing mess is getting out of hand -- and that says
nothing of changing topologies (what do we do with wolfvax's mail when
they hook in to MCNC instead) or the distinction users here have to
make between pnet mail and uucp mail.  Add in ARPA, CSnet, and maybe
Berknet among the duke machines, and you have a royal mess.  I'm
inclined to start a new net newsgroup to discuss mail, networking,
addressing, etc., from a UNIX/uucp point of view -- say, net.net
(fa.tcp-ip appears to be too specialized, though I'll route a copy of
this to the moderator).

Having a newsgroup to discuss nets is different than discussing mail.
I propose net.net and net.mail.  I'm not sure net.net is needed -
does fa.tcp-ip subsume it?  There will probably soon be a net.csnet, too.

Subject:   Networking Discussions in TCP-IP Digest?

Steve -
	While the masthead "TCP-IP Digest" is really rather specialized,
I had intended the Digest as more of a discussion on IMPLEMENTATION
issues of networking (as opposed to Philosophical discussions as
get found in HUMAN-NETS).  The troubles with multiple networks, and
the variety of message formats (for mail), and routing problems in
general are all fair game for the TCP-IP digest.  You are welcome
to have this networking discussion in the TCP digest -- if the volume
becomes too great I would be willing to clone a new digest later on.

	BRL polls Duke via UUCP, so messages addressed to ...!duke!bmd70!tcp-ip
should make it to the digest (no need to go through Berkeley).  Give it
a try.  Our RMAIL is smart enough to prevent accidental gatewaying;  sorry.

					Cheers,
					 -Mike

Subject: TCP/IP and the CYBERS
From: Richard Sitnik

     In a recent message Mike Muuss mentioned that there are
plans to install a version of TCP-IP on the CYBER.  Also, in
Issue 6 of the TCP-IP Digest Mike mentioned that Tektronix has
implemented TCP under NOS.

     I would like to find out more about plans regarding
TCP-IP.  In particular, do you know of anyone who is working on a
NOS/BE version?  I have spoken to Tektronix and their
implementation will only work with NOS and requires a HYPER
channel.  They are not aware of any NOS/BE efforts.  I will
prepare an item for the TCP-IP Digest detailing my discussion
with Tektronix.
