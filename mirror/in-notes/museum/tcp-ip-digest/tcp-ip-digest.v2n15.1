Subject: IP on Ethernets & Berkeley Hacks
To:   tcp-ip@brl

I have been told repeatly by the people from Berkeley (Bill Joy, Sam Leffler)
that the special hacks in the transmission of IP datagrams on the Ethernet
would only be used between consenting hosts and would never appear in a
packet addressed to a standard IP host - even on the same Ethernet.

I would like very much to have an RFC on the proper encapsulation of IP
on an Ethernet (or any other net).  If someone send me a reasonable draft
of an RFC on this i will get it "published".

IBM marketeers are speaking to one of us with a forked tongue.  We in
the DDN PMO have identified at least 250+ customers for the IBM
interface to DDN, and have made it clear to them that we are not
interested in a one of a kind special product.  Granted we have been
dealing with Federal Systems Division people for the most part, but we
have also talked to some of their private sector types as well.  We have
been told that they are moving to market DDN interfaces as "field
service products" initially, and are having internal corporate
discussions re full product line support.  We are closely monitoring
both their VM and MVS efforts, and we are directing every DoD IBM user
to hound his local IBM rep to the grave.

We had an in-depth meeting with IBM people here in the DC area, and they
expressed concern for the strength of DoD's committment to TCP-IP.  More
importantly, they indicated they had recently particippated in a
corporate bloodlet in which ISO vice SNA was touted as the long range
architecture for IBM.  They indicated great reservation for a premature
move to tcp-ip when ISO finals appeared to be imminent.  I think
therefore, that efforts to clarify the ISO situation, and demonstrate
simularities between ISO and the DoD protocols would be more beneficial
in encouraging IBM than demands from readers of the digest.

Subject: A Nearly Elegant Solution to a Gateway Problem
To:   tcp-ip@brl

By a curious coincidence, the very day I read the request for "TCP"/SNA
"Gateway" info was the same day I (earlier) invented the solution.  As
those of you who have read my paper on Gateways (RFC approx. 875) know,
I think so-called Translating/Mapping Gateways are a Very Bad Thing.  As
only one or two who weren't at Vint Cerf's "Futures" panel at INFOCOM
'83 know, I've come to realize
that at a sufficiently far point in the future the way to do
"interoperability" will be by running parallel protocol suites at all
the end points (preferably in suitable Outboard Processing Environments
[formerly known as NFE'S, but nobody paid enough attention to the "N"]).
That is, eventually--unless, contrary to all expectations, one protocol
suite prevails--you'll just go off to a desired application in the
appropriate suite for that appl., and to another appl. in its "home
suite"....  In the meantime, however, something more clever that trying
to yoke heterogeneous mind-sets together by the magic of the strong
assertion that it can be done is needed.

The general near-term solution that makes sense to me is what I've
called a "Janus Host".  (Two-"faced", that is; in other words it looks
to each of two different suites as if it's a "normal" Host.)  It has the
nice property of terminating each suite rather than attempting the
unattractive-in-practice "concatenation of logical connections", which
resolves probably conflicting flow control expectations, and the
additional nice property of allowing for/demanding where necessary
human/"user" intervention to resolve addressing problems.  The trick is,
in essence, to go from one suite's equivalent of User Telnet (from
anywhere) to its Server Telnet (on the Janus Host), then, via a Janus
Host application/process-level program (a "command", even) out the other
suite's generic User Telnet to the desired (generic) Server Telnet.  The
program might be thought of as a sort of transducer; anyway, if the
generic Telnets are anywhere near rightly done, all the de- and
re-virtualizing ought to happen "for free".  Indeed, FTP and Mail ought
to be doable in like manner.

Now that's all so concise as to be terse at best (and cryptic at worst),
but it does seem to me to be theoretically sound.  What good it is in
the ARM/SNA context is much more straightforward:  I know of a company
(called Spartacus Computers, actually) which is doing the Amdahl Trick
to/with VM (i.e., making a different hardware base for "the same"
software), only their box is quite inexpensive.  It also comes with
TCP/IP for their own LANning.  And there's allegedly SNA software for
VM.  Need I say any more (other than that I wish I could claim
royalties--especially when Compion realizes it could easily do the same
trick for ARM/ DECNET Janus Hosts, and whoever else is out there with
the appropriate pieces [including Dave Vinograd with HISI's own
high-rise] realizes...)?

To: tcp-ip@BRL.ARPA

Could someone explain some of the details of the MILNET split.  E.g.
since people have been talking about "mail relays/gateways" am I to
understand that you will not be able to have TCP connections between
hosts in the new MILNET network and the hosts in the present Internet
networks?  Is is the case that the new network will be an IP network,
having a unique IP network number, but will NOT actually be connected
to the current Internet via IP gateways?

[ The NIC <NIC@NIC> has some very good materials discussing the
  split in the latest DDN Newsletters.  If you are not getting copies
  contact them for a subscription.  -Mike ]

On a somewhat related topic:  have people thought out the issue of
Internet access control?  I.e. suppose I have a local net running
IP/TCP and I have all these undergraduates on machines on this net;
according to Arpa policy, only "authorized" people are supposed to
have access to the "Arpanet".  Now what does "Arpanet" means?  Just
network 10?  Any Arpa-funded networks?  Am I obliged to make my IP
gateway to network 10 prevent IP packets coming from the process of
an "unauthorized" user from leaking out?  How would such filtering
be implemented?

Planning to implement high-level protocols on a 68000-based card
attachef to a 10 Mb/s Ethernet, I would like to get in contact with
people who have implemented eihter TCP-IP or XNS protocols on 
similar hardware (preferably in C).  We could exchnage experiences and
possibly programs.

We here at UCB are trying to interface a couple PC's to a vax running
4.1c BSD unix.  We plan on using a 3com board to do this, but they
use XNS software and we'd prefer to keep everything TCP/IP.  I talked
to their dealer here at the PC faire, and they said MIT has the software
we need.  Anyone here know where we can get access to the software?

Chris Kent's recent message that Rice was supporting Berkeley TCP/IP under
Phoenix, our Unix emulator for VMS, was incorrect; Phoenix currently offers
no TCP/IP support.  We are, however, working on a VMS-only TCP that does not
require Phoenix to run, either by bringing up somebody else's implementation
or perhaps writing our own.  We are considering, also, sometime in the future
supporting the Berkeley 4.2 TCP/IP user interface in Phoenix by interfacing
Phoenix to this VMS TCP.  Any comments or experiences with any of the
versions of TCP/IP currently available for VMS would be welcome.

From: Linda Seamonson <ljs@bbn-unix>
Subject: TCP/IP Correctness Testing
To: tcp-ip@brl
Cc: ljs@bbn-unix

Over the last month, several experiments were run at BBN to determine
the correctness of Arpanet host TCP/IP implementations.  Each test was
run several times to minimize the probability that a host was down
during each test; however, it is possible that some hosts scored lower
than they deserved because they were off the network during all tests.

The first experiment was conducted entirely within the Arpanet.  The
second and third experiments, however, required another network attached
to the Arpanet by more than one gateway (since the purpose of the
experiments was to test hosts' abilities to talk through gateways; see
below).  BBN has its own Arpanet-like network called the "BBNNET" which
is currently connected to the Arpanet by three gateways.  One of these
gateways, the BBN-GATEWAY, is known to the rest of the internet; it is
the gateway which is normally used by traffic between the BBNNET and the
Arpanet.  The combination of the Arpanet, the BBNNET, and the three
gateways was used as the testbed for these inter-network experiments.

There were three experiments.  The purpose of the first, Experiment A,
was to determine which hosts are unable to talk TCP even in the simplest
circumstances.  From an Arpanet host, an FTP connection was opened to
every Arpanet host (not including TACs, gateways, or secure hosts).  The
remote FTP server was then asked for "help", which causes half a screen
or so of text to be sent from the remote host to the testing host.  The
purpose of this was simply to cause a little traffic to flow on the FTP
connection.  Then the connection was closed.  This test is the simplest
possible in that it does not require the hosts to talk through a gateway
or to use ICMP.  Hosts which failed this test are labelled "4" in the
following list.  These hosts were excluded from other experiments.

The purpose of Experiment B was to determine which hosts are unable to
talk TCP to a host in another network.  From a BBNNET host, the same FTP
experiment was repeated.  Hosts failing to sustain the FTP conversation
required by this test are labelled "3" in the following list.  These
hosts can talk to hosts in their own network, but not to hosts in other
networks.  These hosts were excluded from Experiment C.

The purpose of Experiment C was to determine which hosts deal
incorrectly with redirect messages.  This experiment was just like
Experiment B, with one complication.  The BBN gateway was told to
redirect all Arpanet hosts to another gateway, "Bridge", that also
connects the Arpanet and the BBNNET.  A program called "HTM" (Host
Traffic Matrix) was run in the Bridge during this experiment.  HTM
records the source and destination of every datagram that passes through
the gateway.  Thus, after running Experiment C, the HTM results in the
Bridge listed every host that obeyed the redirects.  HTM was also run in
the BBN gateway during this experiment, and the results were used as
further proof that some hosts disregarded the redirects altogether.
Some hosts failed this test because even though they did not "choke" on
the redirects and could carry the FTP exchange to completion, they did
not pass any traffic through the Bridge (they ignored the redirects).
Other hosts failed this test because they died or hung the FTP
connection after receiving one or more redirects.  Hosts failing this
experiment are labelled "2".  Hosts passing this experiment are labelled
"1".

In summary, of 190 hosts tested, 98 scored "1" (51%), 28 scored "2"
(15%), 23 scored "3" (12%), and 41 scored "4" (22%).  Since these tests
were very simple and did not exercise all capabilities of TCP (for
example, retransmission of lost datagrams) these results are in no way
proof that all "1" hosts have perfectly correct TCP implementations.

[ The actual table was very large, and has not been included here.
  People who don't know the outcome for their host(s) should write
  to Linda.  -Mike ]
