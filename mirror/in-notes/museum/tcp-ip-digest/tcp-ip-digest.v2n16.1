Some time ago, the Authorities recommended that we should cut down our
gateway files to include only a few prime gateways.  I tried this,
together with a couple of other recommendations, and found that our
Arpanet service totally disappeared.  I did not have time to figure out
which thing I did caused the problem, so I just went back to normal
(i.e. using the whole NIC INTERNET.GATEWAYS file, and removing the other
things I had tried).  Recently I got a complaint from some folks at NYU
that we could not talk to their local hosts because we didn't know about
their gateway.  I just brought up a new gateway file that includes their
gateway.  Immediately before doing this I could not talk to NYU-CMCL1.
Immediately after, I could.  This casts serious doubt on the theory that
prime gateways are enough. Some other authority recommended that people
on the east coast might want to try the gateways file used at BBN.  I
took one from BBNB. Sure enough, it includes only a few gateways, most
of which are prime. I couldn't get through to NYU-CMCL1 with this one
either.

Once again, what gateways file should I be using?  If it is anything
other than the full table from NIC, have you really verified that you
can get to all the hosts?

Part of the problem seems to be that the prime gateways don't 
learn about "new" networks and gateways for a long time after the
nets come up. If they would be updated regularly, then using any
prime gateway would be fine; this is the theory behind the advice
you've received.

The fact is that it sometimes takes months for prime gateways to learn
about new networks, and if you don't explicitly know about the gateway
to a particular gateway, you, ahem, can't get there from here. That's
why you need a large gateway file.

When all gateways speak EGP, this problem should go away. Funny, I haven't
heard much about EGP lately. Does anyone know the status?

There seems to be an assumption in the air that the bbn gateways will
automatically and often update the portion of the routing devoted to
gateways which do not use Gateway Protocl (GGP).  The timing of the
update is not often, and only when I notice changes in the GATEWAY
lines of HOSTS.TXT (not HOST lines with more than one address),
or upon receiving a call or msg from someone close to that gateway.

Non-routing gateways have been handled rather informally in the past,
but I would appreciate information from people about their gateways and
software contacts (mail and telephone numbers).

As the MILNET split approaches, hosts on one side of the split will not
be able to reach nets on the other side if the mailbridges do not know
directly or indirectly about the gateways which reach those nets.

Chris,

EGP gateways are running now at BBN, MIT and Linkabit. Speaking for
those of us who are rummaging around in the innards, it is probably
premature to proliferate any of these three implementations. ALthough
the EGP model seems simple enough, it has turned out to be surprisingly
hard to put into practice, with all the operational constraints and
lackadasical toplogy we have come to expect. Our own implementation
(DCN-GATEWAY) os [art pf the Fuzzball code and probably is not useful in
other systems. Liza Martin's version (MIT-GW?)  is written in C and may
be readily portable. Mike Brescia's version (BBN-TEST) is part of the
standard core-gateway code and may represent what all the rest of f to
talk to.

I think a fair summation of the progress is that a lot of details
important to implementors, such as packet formats, protocol functions,
etc., have been stabilized; however, the "meaning" of some of the packet
fields is yet in dispute, as is the express or implied topological
constraints.

Regards,
Dave

I made no particular assumption about BBN.  Some expert or other
took a number of Tops-20 sites to task for using the entire NIC
gateway table.  It was asserted by a number of expets that every
prime gateway knew about every other gateway.  There was no
suggestion that this was done by informal hand updating.  I got
the impression that somehow the low-level protocols were such that
whenever a site came on the net all the prime gateways heard about
it.  Anyway, the proposal was that instead of using the NIC gateway
table, Tops-20 sites should use a short list of prime gateways, and
that this would be sufficient to let us find any other gateway.
There are serious performance reasons for wanting Tops-20 sites
to start with a short list of gateways.  The only way BBN came into
it specifically was a suggestion that BBN's Tops-20 systems had
list of prime gateways that might be useful for East-coast Tops-20
systems.  Unless somebody can point me to some prime gateways whose
management policies involve automatic updating from the NIC tables,
it looks like I will stick with using the full NIC table myself.

The crucial question here is whether the "gateway system" knows about
the NYU gateway. Prime gateways sufficent only if gateways communicate
with each other. Prime gateways are not sufficent for finding "dumb"
gateways that the core gateways don't know about.

When I try connecting to "NYU-CMCL1" I get a "network unreachable"
message back.  Assuming the NYU gateways is dumb, the right short term
solution was for you to add ONLY that gateway to your file. The right
long term solution is either for them to bring up a GGP|EGP gateway,
or to tell the core gateway maintainers how to get to their net
(although I've heard a rumor that eventually the core gateways will
not support routing through "dumb" gateways).

This doesn't change any of what was said before about gateways files.
To repeat Charlie Lynn's earlier message: you should have a file with
a few prime gateways PLUS any dumb gateways you need to communicate
through.

Well, this all is a surprise.  I've been led to believe that all I
have to do to get something anywhere is to pass it off to a prime gateway.
I'm so convinced of this that the tops-10 implementation does no
routing whatsoever outside its own network.  Now, from what I'm hearing,
not only do I have to do routing for networks with dumb gateways, I
have to provide a source route option on the IP packets if the dumb
gateway is on another network (as of today, no longer a hypothetical
situation).

	It's a cinch my users won't be talking to any dumb networks
any time soon.

Subject: my conclusions from the discussion
To: tcp-ip@SRI-NIC.ARPA

I have read all of your replies very carefully, and read back over the
original discussions from a few months ago.  Let me tell you what I have
concluded about pinging from all of this.  Then somebody can correct me
if I am wrong.  These comments apply only to Tops-20.  The Unix
approach, where they only ping gateways when connections actually  are
using them, seems much better and gets around these problems.

1) Claim: on Tops-20, it is never necessary to ping.

I conclude that this is false.  If the monitor uses a gateway that
happens to be down, there seems to be no way for it to know that without
pinging.  It may continue to use that gateway forever.  I conclude that
it is only necessary to ping gateways where there is an alternate
gateway that could be used to get to the same place.  If a gateway is
the only gateway and it goes down, you might as well continue trying to
use it.  Also, unless you are using source routing, it seems not to
do any good to ping gateways that are not directly attached to the
same network you are on.  It is the first gateway's job to keep track of
the rest of the route.

2) Claim: 37 sec is too often.

Well, this is a matter of taste.  However if it takes 4 times this long
to discover that a gateway is down, and if you want dynamic recovery
to occur, it does seem that this is about as long as one should ask
people to wait.  After this, programs will start timing out.

3) Claim: You only need to put prime gateways in your table.

This seems to be false.  We got responses from one manager of a prime
gateway, and he does not seem to update his tables from the NIC
tables on a regular basis.  Also our own experience suggests that
this is not happening.  Until we hear from a prime gateway that
guarantees to keep its tables up to date, we conclude that prime
gateways are only guaranteed to know about each other.

4) Claim: People on the East Coast should copy BBN's gateway
file and those on the West Coast should copy ISI's.

This is a matter of taste. The only thing is, BBN's lists only BBN
gateways and ISI's lists only ISI's gateways.  What I want is about 3
gateways scattered around the country, that are known to be reliable.
This doesn't seem a very promising start.

I conclude therefore that on Tops-20, my gateway table should
include the following:

 - a selection of prime gateways.  The others are safe to omit because
	prime gateways know about each other through GGP.  Is this
	really true?
 - all dumb and host gateways.  However it is safe to treat most of
	them as always-up (i.e. not to ping them - from the code it
	appears that the only different between dumb, host, and
	always-up is that always-up does not ping).  You only need to
	ping where there are alternate gateways, and the gateway
	involved is directly connected to your network. If you have no
	choice, you might as well not ping, since there is nothing you
	can do if you find out the gateways is down.
 - all always-up gateways

I have just written a program that traces the topology of the network
and changes gateways to always-up if there is no alternative gateway
going to the same place, or if the gateway is not directly
attached to the Arpanet.  It also purges Arpanet/Milnet gateways other
than our designated gateway, (The theory is that the others won't talk
to us.) and all prime gateways other than our designated Milnet gateway
and 2 other selected gateways. (I am using BBN-C and SRI-R2D2, for no
particular reason.  Note that I have chosen gateways that have
alternates, so that my algorithm treats them as really being prime.) The
result is that we are pinging 3 prime, 4 dumb, and 1 host  gateway,
rather than the 38 that we would do with the unaltered host table.
Furthermore, all of them are directly on the Arpanet.  This number will
go up temporarily by one when we go back to the old topology.

I have one point to make prompted by a peripheral issue in your message.
Someone correct me if I am wrong, but I believe even after we revert to
the old topology, it will be safe to continue to use the new TOPS-20
INTERNET.GATEWAYS file. The world has gained 5 more BBN-maintained PRIME
gateways for this test day, but they are planned to be around from now
on. Naturally connections to net 26 will fail, but use of other
functions of the gateway will succeed.

I would appreciate a list of which PRIME gateways are maintained from
BBN, besides the new ARPANET/MILNET Gateways.

Subject:  MILNET/ARPANET SPLIT

Network service to the local nets BRLNET (128.20.x.x) and BRLNET1
(192.5.21.x) was unavailable during the ARPANET/MILNET split test.
Despite planning made to switch over the BRL-GATEWAY to do the
proper things we could not pass traffic to a majority of the hosts
on the net.  The reason for this problem was that even though the
gateway was prepared to be moved to MILNET (net 26) and the host port
on the imp was assigned to that COI, the BBN gateways continued to
route the subnets to the old ARPANET (net 10) address.  When BBN was
informed that the gateway was switched to the MILNET, they switched
it back for the interim.  This didn't help much because the network
topology no longer corresponded to the HOST/GATEWAY tables available
from NIC.  Hosts who derived explicit routing to the BRL-GATEWAY (or
would have liked to PING it for whatever routing) from the tables,
had their traffic turned back with the "administratively prohibitted"
message.

This demonstrates that the network split may not be transparent even to
those who load host tables regularly and fully support the Internet
Protocols.

-Ron

[ Ron informes me that as of this writing, BBN has been alerted to the
  error.  However, if there are any other dual-homed hosts or Gateways
  on the MILNET side of the split, you need to talk to Mike Brescia
  of BBN *quickly*.  -Mike]
