  Three questions on availablity:

1)  Is anyone implementing, or planning to implement, 4.2 BSD Unix on
    a micro - besides Sun Microsystems?

2)  Is anyone selling/implementing/planning to implement TCP/IP on
    Ethernet for the IBM-PC - besides MIT?  I believe the 3Com stuff uses XNS.

3)  Is there a commercially available Unix microsystem running TCP/IP
    on Ethernet, or can one be *easily* (no kernal hacking) put together?

  Thanks for any advice or pointers.

Subject:  TCP/IP on Perkin/Elmer

	We have a Perkin/Elmer here at BRL, and we had also heard that
TCP/IP was available for the 32xx series.  Indeed it is, but only on
RS232 lines!!  They won't talk to an Ethernet, 1822 interface, or
even a direct HDLC line between two hosts.  Essentially there is no
good way to talk to them.  TCP/IP over RS232 lines is a poor excuse
for networking for a machine like that.  I rattled their cage that
something should happen in time, but I don't know what form it will
take.  If you hope to hook you PE to the ARPANET or even a local
net with TCP/IP, good luck.  While the software is probably good
enough (or at least close), the hardware just isn't there and interfaced
to the network code.

Subject: low cost ethernet terminal cluster controller
To: tcp-ip@brl
Cc: croft@BRL.ARPA

Does anyone sell an "inexpensive" box that allows RS232
terminals access to internet hosts via a local ethernet?
These boxes typically contain a CPU, some number of
UARTs (8 to 16) and an ethernet interface.  In PROM
(or downloaded by PROM) would be code for IP/TCP/TELNET
and simple terminal driving software.

Boxes like this are currently on the market, but with
protocols other than TCP.  It seems to me that using
single board construction and the new Ethernet chip-sets,
it should be possible to get the cost of a connection
to the internet down to a few hundred dollars.
Such a box would even be a good way to connect local
terminals to local hosts, being cheaper than a
"port selector" or running hardwired lines all over
your campus.

Stanford has a SUN based "Ethertip", but it
is currently: (1) somewhat expensive (around $6000?)
since it uses multiple boards.  (2) PUP based (instead
of TCP) at the moment.

Subject:  The MILNET Split: One Perspective

I write this letter almost a full week from the initiation of the MILNET
split, after having spent yet another night riding shotgun on the mail
queues, trying to make sure that we re-establish connectivity before our
11-day "failed mail" timer goes off.  Most of the effort lies in running
endless series of tests to determine which hosts STILL have non-functional
routing tables between them and us.

Sadly, this digest will only be received by people who are doing things
right, so I have to resort to other techniques for getting routing tables
updated.  Perhaps if we all apply enough gentle persuasion, things
can get tidied up in a hurry.

The problem, you see, is that we at BRL have really, truely *believed*
in the viability of the InterNet concept.  Of course, we still do,
although we certainly have felt rather lonely in our little corner of
the InterNet here, only being able to communicate with a "select few".
A good thing that ONE of our machines remains connected to the backbone
(MILNET, in this case), or we would not even had any place to send
our complaints from!  All of our machines save that one are safely tucked
away behind our own local gateway, so that we can engineer our own
solutions to our communications difficulties.  And, therein lies the
rub.

To begin by giving credit where credit is due:  Mike Brescia and the
PRIME Gateway crew at BBN had their act together.  Pop a packet for
BRLNET off to a BBN Prime gateway, and things work perfectly
(except for the MILARPA IMP blowing up unexpectedly, but that's another
story).

A great deal of the difficulty seems to be that absolutely nobody
expected to find a GATEWAY on MILNET!  Ho hum;  well, here we are.
About the only people who could talk to BRLNET after the split were
hosts which didn't bother making routing decisions, and instead
use the rather pragmatic "wildcard routing" algorithm:

  "Gee, this packet isn't for anybody I know -- let's send it to BBN!"

Worked splendidly.  Now, for the rest of the world.  When half the "10"s
became "26"s, everybody diligently updated their host tables.  But,
not so many sites remembered to (usually manually) extract the
current network topology from the GATEWAY section of the NIC tables,
and to reflect those changes in their routing table entries.
I suppose that it was easy to be lulled into a false sense of security,
because most gateways stayed put.  Only about 5 moved from the ARPANET
to MILNET, and the BRL-GATEWAY was probably one of the more noticable
ones.

  "Where did our UNIX-Wizards mail go? ...."

We heard the cries, and noticed the megabytes of accumulation in our
mail queues.  (And noticed our packet counts down by more than 50%).
Want to know how Ron Natalie (my "partner in packets") and I spent
our week?  Phoning and writing to host administrators, trying to help
them figure out how to update their routing tables (a startling number
needed a good deal of help to discover what to change).  Running
tests:  Can we hit them from BRLNET2?  BRLNET?  A MILNET host?
A MILNET TAC?  How about an ARPA host?  Humbug.

(A big round of thanks to Jake and the crew at the NIC -- without the
network directory and WHOIS service, we would have been sunk.
ThankYouThankyouthankythankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou.)

TCP and IP work.  We know that, it's a fact.  But, there seems to
be an almost totally manual mechanism involved when it comes time
to "program" the IP routings.  Disapointing.  (I'd like to note in
passing that, except for loading new host tables into all our hosts,
the only thing Ron had to do was pop a new routing table into our
Gateway.  Our part was easy).  If somebody ever 'nukes the InterNet
until it glows, nothing will work.  Not unless we all take a serious
look at improving the IP routing mechanisms that exist in each and
every host.

BBN-supplied PRIME gateways for everybody probably is not the answer;
either is the long awaited EGP protocol.  But, hopefully, someday,
somebody will work it out.

I'd like to see the next few issues of the digest concentrate on
how the InterNet as an integrated communications system should
"become aware" of changes in the underlying communications configuration,
so that in the future the configuration of the network can undergo
rapid changes (planned and unplanned) and still continue operating.
Think of the flexability this affords: responding to administrative
edicts.  Government foolishness.  Natural disaster.  And yes, even *war*.

(Pardon the rather flippant tone of this message, but I've been chasing
packets across the network all night, and this is my therapy.)

As I was istalling the new host table, I noticed for the first time
that the NIC is going to be on "the other side" of the net from me.
Does this mean that, once the mail bridges are installed, I won't
be able to make TCP connections for host tables and such? Or will
there be a net 10 NIC, too?

The NIC's ARPANET interface has just recently arrived and is
undergoing testing, so please do not try to connect to us at
10.0.0.51.  When we are up on both nets, our entry in the host table
will contain both net addresses.  In the meantime, there should be no
problem connecting to SRI-NIC to get tables or other files, whether
you are on net 10 or net 26.

Thanks to all who wrote and told me that 10.0.0.51 (ST-NIC) will be the
Arpanet connection to the NIC, and that the interface just arrived and
isn't available for use yet, but when it does, it will appear as a

Charles,

I  have been reading the 'pinging' dialog as it goes along and
in your message of 8-sep-83 you state "our experience suggests that
this [updating one's tables from the NIC tables on a regular basis]
is not happening". Our experience here at the NIC is just the opposite.
We logged several thousand accesses to the NIC host name server in
August and we expect September and October to be heavier due to the
need to refresh tables due to the network split.  If you are a recipient
of the DDN-News you are aware that DCA has requested that all hosts
implement the Hostnames Server protocol (RFC 811) and the RFC is included
in the Protocol Handbook.    Further, DCA has asked BBN to register all
gateways with the NIC and to make sure that they do not assign any names
to gateways that have not been registered first.  The NIC has been designated
the official registrar for naming entities on both MILNET and ARPANET
and we are tasked with providing name service to users.  We have also
registered any information from 'foreign' nets that has been provided to
us.

There has been a lot of confusion about host name tables, and I am the
first to admit that in the past the whole issue of gateway names and
addresses and whether they were prime or dumb was very murky.  Also,
we have just gotten our new equipment installed, and once the second
interface is in place (hopefully in a couple of weeks) we will be
accessible from both MILNET and ARPANET.  I believe some of the issues
have been resolved, that our tables are the most current with respect
to ARPANET and MILNET hosts, that FTPing host name files is more tedious
than using the host name service, and that we are now providing good
service.  I urge you to use our table as the reference table for local
tables and to collaborate with us to make the service and the information
even better.  

One other piece of information in case it was missed by some of you.
We now have set up a mailbox called HOSTMASTER@SRI-NIC so that host name
info goes directly to Mary Stahl without stopping off in my mail or
in the NIC mail.  This has helped speed up the addition of new data
tremendously.  There is also a template called 'Host-approve' for persons
making changes to host names or addresses on MILNET or ARPANET.  All
changes should be reported using this template.  New hosts will not
be enabled until this template has been approved by DCA.  Although this
adds some formality to the process, it has actually worked reasonably
well in that there is now a known and published procedure and we no
longer get the info on the back of envelopes or scribbled on someone's
business card.  It also means that DCA, BBN, and the NIC are in much
better sync than was true in the past.

I hope this update of where things stand has been useful to the 
community with respect to host names in general and gateway names
in particular.  Ken Harrenstien (KLH@SRI-NIC) is the NIC contact for
the Host Name Server and Mary Stahl (Dyer) (STAHL@SRI-NIC) is the
Hostmaster (or actually mistress).  We appreciate the feedback and
discussion we have received from many of you and request that you
keep those cards and letters and host names coming in.

Regards,

Jake Feinler/NIC

P.M. (for post mortem)  Yesterday was the day the network split into
two networks - ARPANET and MILNET and I am pleased to report that
things went rather well.  The major problem we saw with respect to
host naming, etc., was that TAC users had not been informed to use
the net number in trying to log in which meant that sometimes they
could not get in.  The NIC is currently 26.0.0.73 and will also be
10.0.0.51 in the near future.  We will keep you posted on this.

cc: tcp-ip@SRI-NIC.ARPA, klh@SRI-NIC.ARPA, stahl@SRI-NIC.ARPA

The claim was not that you were out of date but that apparently some
gateways were.  I concluded this for two reasons:
  - that NYU's gateway was not known by the prime gateways when I
	last tested it.  (Presumably it is now, but I am no longer
	depending upon prime gateways for routing.)
  - that one of the managers of a prime gateway (I think a BBN gateway)
	described the problem from his end, and he did not seem to be
	using the NIC host tables.
  - I said that I would be happy to hear from the manager of any gateway
	that was in fact updating itself regularly from the NIC tables.
	I have not heard from any, nor have any sent mail to the
	mailing list.
I believe I am justified in concluding from this that the gateways
do not automatically update themselves from your tables.  As I am sure
you know, N thousand accesses to your host tables does not prove that
any particular set of systems (i.e. the prime gateways) are using them.
Rutgers does update its tables regularly from yours.  We use FTP, as we
want to have the rest of the <NETINFO> directory, i.e. the RFC's and
other random stuff.  Our host and gateway tables are based on yours.  To
the host tables we add 3 additional nicknames that you did not accept
but are essential for local operation.  We change most of the entries in
the gateway table to always-up, to minimize pinging.  But we certainly
are using your work.  I have no complaints about your service.  I know
you have been working very hard to track all of the changes that are
going on.  The only question is whether the gateways are using your
work.

By the way, it turns out that this issue is not really crucial to us. We
ping only 3 selected prime gateways and other gateways that are on
alternative routes.  We would have to ping these even if the prime
gateways were completely up to date.  The purpose of pinging is not to
find routes, but rather to see whether routes are in service or not. The
only way prime gateways could help us is if they would somehow tell us
whenever another gateway went down.  This is probably not a reasonable
request.

Subject:  On the Undesirability of "Mail Bridges" as a Security Measure

Seeing the last few messages brings back to mind the ugly prospect
looming ever larger:  that we will not have ONE InterNet, and we will
not have TWO InterNets, but we will in fact have One-and-a-Half
InterNets, stuck together with mail-only "bridges" (ie Data Fences),
which will prevent the ARPA EXPNET and the MILNET communities from
exchanging data with each other.  In my nightmares, I see things
degenerating to much the same level of service as where the InterNet
touches on "foreign" (non-TCP) networks today.  Unable to retrieve
files, important data will be shipped as mail, and will suffer the
indelicacies of having headers and trailers slapped on it, spaces and
dots and tabs munged with, etc.  Reprehensible kludges like
UUENCODE/UUDECODE will have to become commonplace again.  It's bad
enough having to mail files to USENET, CSNET, etc; but between the
EXPNET and MILNET?  Come on!

I'm entirely in favor of separating the backbones of the two networks;
in addition to giving DCA a much greater degree of control over engineering
the MILNET portion, it also permits the ARPANET portion to do horrible
things to their IMPs, to play partitioning experiments, and generally
have enough of a reprieve from operational considerations to be able
to do meaningful experiments again.  All this is good.

Forcing the split was a good thing, too.  It polished off NCP once-and-for-all,
and it demonstrated that the IP protocol really *does* operate as claimed.
Funneling all IP communications through ``n'' gateways (n=5 at present)
is good, too.  Gets people thinking about multi-path routing algorithms,
and provides a good "safety valve", just in case there should ever be
valid military reasons for separating the networks.

I even believe that TAC access controls (TACACS) are a good thing; I
look forward to the day when (most) all the TAC phone numbers are
published, and freely availible.  But it is important not to be lulled
into a false sense of "security" by measures like TACACS and the
mail-only bridges.  Every host on the network is still required, by
regulation, to take a comprehensive approach to system security.  (The
relevant Army regulation is AR 380-380, similar regulations exist for
the other services).  Every military host is obligated to observe
sercurity procedures as carefully in normal operations as if 50,000
TACACS cards had just been issued to the public school system.  Hiding
ourselves behind mail-only bridges is only asking for trouble, later on.
Being on the MILNET isn't significantly different from offering commercial
(or AUTOVON or FTS) dial-up service, in terms of the threat posed by an
outsider trying to get in.  Now the CLASSIFIED community, that's different.
But there's none of that sort of information on the MILNET, right?

So, here is a loud plea from one (military) researcher who says
"Don't cut the lines of communication!"  An emphatic YES to
security.  Do it by the regulations!  But don't depend on partial
network connectivity as a security measure -- it won't help, and it sure
can hurt.  (Ouch!).
