RFC stands for Request For Comments.  It is not at all clear that
comments were really wanted.  If there were such a thing as an
acceptance vote on 822, I guess I would have to vote against it -- too
many of the changes seem to be capricious and without agreement by a
large number of the people impacted.

In fact, I am not sure why 822 even exists.  Why not leave things as
they are until we can agree upon a complete (not incremental) overhaul
of mail protocols?
