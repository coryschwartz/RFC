Subject: Decrease in submissions

Due to a serious decrease in submissions, this issue and subsequent
issues will be sent out as soon as possible, rather than waiting for
a while to "batch" together messages.  I suppose everybody is too busy
setting up their TCP code to send messages....

			Good Luck....TCP only day is near!

Does anyone have the system interface code and drivers for Unix v7 to
fit between 3COM TCP/IP and an LH/DH 11?  Obviously we need it before

Just wanted to post a short note to let folks running the BBN TCP/IP
for the VAX that we've written finger and echo servers, and that
anyone who wants a copy is welcome to them.

Cheers,

I would like to find out the following information about TCP implementations.

   - How many different implementations of TCP exist.

   - In which language have they been implemented.  Approximately how many
     lines of code are there in the implementation.

   - On which computers have they been implemented.

   - How much memory and processing power do they require.

If  you  send  the  replies  directly to me I will post my findings back on the
list.  Thanks in advance Sesh

Subject: TCP-IP Digest Archive

I have been informed by the NIC that they now have a directory
	[SRI-NIC] <TCP-DIGEST>
where they have complete archives of the digest to date.

The NIC is host 10.0.0.73 and supports anonymous NCP FTP.
