Another purpose is\r\nto demonstrate that the security measures described in this document\r\nare sufficient to protect a VPN.  Finally, this document encourages\r\nreplication of the experiment.","pub_date":"August 2025","keywords":["IPv6","Destination Option","VPN"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9837","errata_url":null}
