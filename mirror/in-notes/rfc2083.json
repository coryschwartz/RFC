PNG provides a patent-free replacement for\r\nGIF and can also replace many common uses of TIFF.  Indexed-color,\r\ngrayscale, and truecolor images are supported, plus an optional alpha\r\nchannel.  Sample depths range from 1 to 16 bits.\r\n\r\nPNG is designed to work well in online viewing applications, such as\r\nthe World Wide Web, so it is fully streamable with a progressive\r\ndisplay option.  PNG is robust, providing both full file integrity\r\nchecking and simple detection of common transmission errors.  Also,\r\nPNG can store gamma and chromaticity data for improved color matching\r\non heterogeneous platforms.\r\n\r\nThis specification defines the Internet Media Type image\/png.","pub_date":"February 1997","keywords":["PNG","file","format","bitmap"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC2083","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc2083"}
