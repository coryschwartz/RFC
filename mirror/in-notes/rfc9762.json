The flag is used to\r\nindicate that the network prefers that clients use the deployment\r\nmodel in RFC 9663 instead of using individual addresses in the\r\non-link prefix assigned using Stateless Address Autoconfiguration\r\n(SLAAC) or DHCPv6 address assignment. \r\n\r\nThis document updates RFC 4862 to indicate that the Autonomous flag\r\nin a PIO needs to be ignored if the PIO has the P flag set.  It also\r\nupdates RFC 4861 to specify that the P flag indicates DHCPv6 prefix\r\ndelegation support for clients.","pub_date":"June 2025","keywords":["ipv6","slaac","pio","dhcpv6-pd"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC4861","RFC4862"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9762","errata_url":null}
