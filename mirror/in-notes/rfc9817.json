While such functionality can be beneficial,\r\nit has to be carefully placed into the context of the general\r\nInternet communication, and it needs to be clearly identified where\r\nand how those benefits apply.\r\n\r\nThis document presents some use cases to demonstrate how a number of\r\nsalient COIN-related applications can benefit from COIN. \r\nFurthermore, to guide research on COIN, it identifies essential\r\nresearch questions and outlines desirable capabilities that COIN\r\nsystems addressing these use cases may need to support.  Finally, the\r\ndocument provides a preliminary categorization of the described\r\nresearch questions to source future work in this domain.  This\r\ndocument is a product of the Computing in the Network Research Group\r\n(COINRG).  It is not an IETF product and it is not a standard.","pub_date":"August 2025","keywords":["COIN","in-network computing","VR","XR","Industry 4.0","Industrial IIoT","Performing Arts","CDN","P4"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9817","errata_url":null}
