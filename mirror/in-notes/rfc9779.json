SR\r\nenables the forwarding of packets through an ordered list of\r\ninstructions, known as segments, which are imposed at the ingress\r\nnode.  This document defines the procedures and extensions necessary\r\nto perform accurate measurement of packet loss and delay in SR-MPLS\r\nenvironments, ensuring that network operators can effectively measure\r\nand maintain the quality of service across their SR-based MPLS\r\nnetworks. This includes coverage of links and end-to-end SR-MPLS\r\npaths, as well as SR Policies.","pub_date":"May 2025","keywords":["Delay Measurement","Loss Measurement","Link Measurement","SR-MPLS Policy Measurement"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9779","errata_url":null}
