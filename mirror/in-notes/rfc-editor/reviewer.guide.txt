GUIDELINES FOR REVIEWERS OF
RFC INDEPENDENT SUBMISSIONS

17 Jan 07


______________________________________________________________

DISSEMINATION OF REVIEWS

All reviews (perhaps in summary) will be shared with the author(s), and
many will be shared with the RFC Editorial Board for their information.

By default, we will identify you the reviewer to the author.  However,
you may request reviewer anonymity (except in the case of an
unsolicited review).  TO REQUEST ANONYMITY, YOU MUST TELL US WHEN YOU
SUBMIT THE REVIEW.

Reviews may be posted publicly on the RFC Editor web site, with
author approval.  In this posting, your anonymity will be respected
if you requested it.

CONTENTS OF REVIEWS

Questions we would like you to answer:

A. Is the subject of this document relevant to the RFC Series?

	Although the series was originally broadly scoped to include
	any aspect of computer networking, its scope has become
	centered on the Internet.  This includes all Internet protocol
	technology as well as related hardware issues (e.g., how to run
	IP over X hardware).  More speculative are documents specific
	to particular link layer or physical layer technologies.
	Your opinion here will be useful, although the RFC Editor,
	in consultation with the Editorial Board, will make the final
	decision.

B. Is this document technically competent, as far as you can tell?

C. Is this document in reasonable (not necessarily final) editorial shape?

D. Are the Abstract and Introduction of this document reasonably clear
	for those Internet techies who may not be experts in the particular
	subject matter?

	Do the Title and Abstract fairly and accurately summarize the
	contents?

E. Does the document make clear up front how the specification
	does/does not relate to past or current IETF activities?

Any additional suggestions that you can make to improve the quality
and clarity of the document will be welcomed by us and in most cases
will be welcomed by the author(s).
