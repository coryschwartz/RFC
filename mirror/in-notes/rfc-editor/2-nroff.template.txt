1. Introduction

   This document is a template for preparing an nroff source file for an
   Internet Draft or an RFC.  It contains instructions for applying
   nroff to this file to create a correct Internet Draft.

   This document summarizes and embodies the simple nroff subset that is
   used for markup by the RFC Editor, and it provides guidelines for
   authors who are able to submit nroff source to the RFC Editor.  This
   document also includes some RFC style guidelines in addtion to those
   listed in http://www.ietf.org/ietf/1id-guidelines.html.

   With very rare exceptions, an RFC should begin with an Introduction
   section that is numbered 1.  The introduction should provide enough
   background so that any reasonably informed Internet person can
   quickly and clearly understand the purpose, scope, and assumptions
   behind the document.  This may require some *brief* background beyond
   that required by a person working directly on this particular
   technical topic.

2. Using Nroff


2.1.  Features Used by RFC Editor

   The RFC Editor generally uses the simplest nroff features, basically
   the "-ms" macro package and the following few basic nroff directives:

   DIRECTIVE        FUNCTION

   .ce              Center following line.

   .ti #            'temporary indent' -- # is number of spaces.
                    Indents only the line immediately following.

   .in #            Change indentation to # spaces

Internet Draft     2-nroff.template   October 25, 2006


   .nf              'No fill': begin block of text to be displayed.

   .fi              Fill (i.e., left-justify, line wrap)

   .ne #            'need' -- Keep following # lines on same page

   .bp              Break page

   .br              Break line

   .KS              'Keep Start' -- lines up to .KE on same page

   .KE              'Keep End' -- end of 'keep' block

   Nroff also has a '.sp' (space) directive to insert a blank line.
   However, it is far easier (and more readable) to use the fact that
   each blank line in the nroff source creates a blank line in the
   output.

   Nroff includes many variations on the trivial commands shown above.
   For example, indentation can be specified relative to the current
   indentation, using '.in +#' or '.in -#'.  Authors are welcome to use
   such features, but for simplicity this template uses only the
   simplest set of commands.

   Some authors who are proficient in nroff will wish to use more
   advanced features, including perhaps their own macros.  This is a
   private matter for the author, unless and until the document is
   submitted to the RFC Editor for publication as an RFC.  Upon document
   submission, the RFC Editor will request the nroff source, if any.  If
   the source is sufficiently straightforward, it will be used by the
   RFC Editor to speed the publication process.  If not, the RFC Editor
   will generate a new nroff source, generally using the simple subset
   above.

   The considerations here are as follows:

      o  Defined macros (beyond the -ms package) must be in-line at the
         front of the source.  The RFC Editor is currently prepared to
         maintain only one source file for each published RFC.

      o  Some of the editors are not nroff experts, and even those who
         may be do not have the time to figure out some complex/obscure
         macro.  If any special knowledge about these macros is needed
         to modify the text for editorial purposes, the RFC Editor will
         find it more expedient to generate a new .nroff source for the
         document.

Internet Draft     2-nroff.template   October 25, 2006


      o  The RFC Editor does not keep a distinct Make file for each RFC,
         so it is not helpful to send us a tar file or shar script that
         magically makes a directory and builds an RFC.  Our primary
         input is a .txt file, with a .nroff file as a possible
         secondary input.  When the RFC is published, the RFC Editor
         will archive a .txt file and a corresponding .nroff file.

   In other words, keep it simple and you can help us a lot; don't show
   off your programming prowess and waste our time.

2.2.  Formatting End of Page

   The Unix command to create a formatted Internet Draft is:

         "nroff -ms input-file.nroff > output-file.txt"

   However, nroff will not follow the RFC standard format for a page: a
   Form feed (FF or Control-L)) after the last visible line on the page
   and no extra line feeds before the first visible line of the next
   page.  We want:

           last visible line on page i
           ^L
           first visible line on page i+1

   We invented hacks to fix this.  The original hack was a "sed" script
   that called a "C" program called "pg".  More recently, we have been
   using a simple Perl script (see Appendix A).  Then the command to
   process the nroff source file becomes:

         nroff -ms input-file.nroff | fix.pl > output-file.txt

   For example:

         nroff -ms 2-nroff.template | fix.pl > 2-nroff.template.txt

3.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations relevant to this document.

4.  IANA Considerations

   No actions are required from IANA as result of the publication of
   this document.

5.  Appendix A: "Perl" Script for Pagination


#! /local/bin/perl

# fix.pl  17-Nov-93  Craig Milo Rogers at USC/ISI
#
#       The style guide for RFCs calls for pages to be delimited by the
# sequence <last-non-blank-line><formfeed-line><first-non-blank-line>.
# Unfortunately, NROFF is reluctant to produce output that conforms to
# this convention.  This script fixes RFC-style documents by searching
# for the token "FORMFEED[Page", replacing "FORMFEED" with spaces,
# appending a formfeed line, and deleting white space up to the next
# non-white space character.
#
#       There is one difference between this script's output and that of
# the "fix.sh" and "pg" programs it replaces: this script includes a
# newline after the formfeed after the last page in a file, whereas the
# earlier programs left a bare formfeed as the last character in the
# file.  To obtain bare formfeeds, uncomment the second substitution
# command below.  To strip the final formfeed, uncomment the third
# substitution command below.
#
#       This script is intended to run as a filter, as in:
#
# nroff -ms input-file | fix.pl > output-file
#
#       When porting this script, please observe the following points:
#
# 1)    ISI keeps perl in "/local/bin/perl";  your system may keep it
#       elsewhere.
# 2)    On systems with a CRLF end-of-line convention, the "\n"s below
#       may have to be replaced with "\r\n"s.

$* = 1;                                 # Enable multiline patterns.
undef $/;                               # Read whole files in a single
                                        # gulp.

while (<>) {                            # Read the entire input file.
    s/FORMFEED(\[Page\s+\d+\])\s+/        \1\n\f\n/g;
                                        # Rewrite the end-of-pages.
#    s/\f\n$/\f/;                       # Want bare formfeed at end?
#    s/\f\n$//;                         # Want no formfeed at end?
    print;                              # Print the resultant file.
}
