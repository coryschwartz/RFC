File: ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc-editor/copyright.23Jan01

This file is essentially the "copyright-story" file created by Jon
Postel sometime before 1988.  It was slightly reformatted and clarified
in January 2001, but its essential content and style were unchanged,
and it therefore reflects the historical rules for RFC Editor
copyrights.  It was written in Postel's characteristic style: concise,
direct, and functional.

RFC COPYRIGHTS

To protect the integrity of RFC publication, all RFCs are published 
with an ISOC (Internet Society) copyright statement.  The text of
the standard copyright statement is appended below.

This copyright notice was designed to ensure that Request For Comments
(RFC) documents will have the widest possible distribution.  The following
general guidelines control the reproduction and modification of RFCs.

1. Copying and distributing an entire RFC without any changes:

  1a. The copying and free redistribution are generally encouraged.

  1b. The inclusion of such RFC copies in other documents and
      collections that are distributed for a fee is also encouraged.
      However, in this case it is a courtesy (i) to ask the RFC author and
      (ii) provide the RFC author with a copy of the final document or
      collection.

        Anyone can take some RFCs, put them in a book, copyright the
        book, and sell it.  This in no way inhibits anyone else from
        doing the same thing, or inhibits any other distribution of
        the RFCs.

2. Copying and distributing the whole RFC with changes in format,
   font, etcetera:

  2a. The same as case 1, with the addition that a note should be made
      of the reformatting.

3. Copying and distributing portions of an RFC:

  3a. As with any material excerpted from another source, proper credit
      and citations must be provided.

4.  Translating RFCs into other languages:

  4a. Since wide distribution of RFCs is very desirable, translation
      into other languages is also desirable.  The same requirements and
      courtesies should be followed in distributing RFCs in translation as
      would be followed when distributing RFCs in the original language.
