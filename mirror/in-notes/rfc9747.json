This\r\n\"Unaffiliated BFD Echo\" mechanism allows rapid detection of\r\nforwarding path failures in networks where establishing BFD control\r\nsessions is impractical or undesirable. By decoupling the Echo\r\nfunction from the control plane, network devices can utilize BFD's\r\nfast failure detection capabilities in a simplified manner, enhancing\r\nnetwork resiliency and operational efficiency. \r\n\r\nThis document updates RFC 5880 by defining a new Unaffiliated BFD\r\nEcho mechanism.","pub_date":"March 2025","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC5880"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9747","errata_url":null}
