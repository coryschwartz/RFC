Issues concerning multipacket messages,\r\nHost retransmission, duplicate detection, sequencing,\r\nand acknowledgment are discussed. Simplifications\r\nto the IMP\/IMP protocol are proposed on the assumption\r\nthat new Host level protocols are adopted. Familiarity\r\nwith the current protocol designs is probably necessary\r\nsince many of the arguments refer to details in the\r\npresent protocol design.","pub_date":"April 1974","keywords":["Theoretical and practical motivation for redesign","multipacket messages","host retransmission","duplicate detection","sequencing","acknowledgement"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC0635","errata_url":null}
