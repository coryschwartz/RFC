Such IPv6 prefixes are called \"Colored Prefixes\", and this\r\nmechanism is called \"Colored Prefix Routing\" (CPR). In SRv6 networks,\r\nthe Colored Prefixes are the SRv6 locators associated with different\r\nintents. SRv6 services (e.g., SRv6 VPN services) with a specific\r\nintent could be assigned with SRv6 Segment Identifiers (SIDs) under\r\nthe corresponding SRv6 locators, which are advertised as Colored\r\nPrefixes.\r\n\r\nThis operational methodology allows the SRv6 service traffic to be\r\nsteered into end-to-end intent-aware paths based on the longest\r\nprefix matching of SRv6 Service SIDs to the Colored Prefixes. The\r\nexisting IPv6 Address Family and Color Extended Community are reused\r\nto advertise IPv6 Colored Prefixes without new BGP extensions; thus,\r\nthis mechanism is easy to interoperate and can be deployed\r\nincrementally in multi-Autonomous System (AS) networks that belong to\r\nthe same trusted domain.","pub_date":"May 2025","keywords":["intent-aware routing"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9723","errata_url":null}
