This document advances that recommendation to a standards\r\nrequirement in BGP; it prohibits the use of the AS_SET and\r\nAS_CONFED_SET path segment types in the AS_PATH.  This is done to\r\nsimplify the design and implementation of BGP and to make the\r\nsemantics of the originator of a BGP route clearer. This will also\r\nsimplify the design, implementation, and deployment of various BGP\r\nsecurity mechanisms. This document updates RFC 4271 by deprecating\r\nthe origination of BGP routes with AS_SET (Type 1 AS_PATH segment)\r\nand updates RFC 5065 by deprecating the origination of BGP routes\r\nwith AS_CONFED_SET (Type 4 AS_PATH segment). Finally, it obsoletes\r\nRFC 6472.","pub_date":"May 2025","keywords":[],"obsoletes":["RFC6472"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC4271","RFC5065"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9774","errata_url":null}
