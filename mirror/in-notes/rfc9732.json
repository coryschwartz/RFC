Typically, an NRP-based\r\nenhanced VPN will be used to underpin network slicing, but it could\r\nalso be of use in its own right providing enhanced connectivity\r\nservices between customer sites. This document also provides an\r\noverview of relevant technologies in different network layers and\r\nidentifies some areas for potential new work.","pub_date":"March 2025","keywords":["network slicing","traffic engineering","performance guarantee"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9732","errata_url":null}
