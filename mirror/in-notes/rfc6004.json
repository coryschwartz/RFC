This document supports the types of switching corresponding\r\nto the Ethernet services that have been defined in the context of the\r\nMetro Ethernet Forum (MEF) and International Telecommunication Union\r\n(ITU) G.8011.  Specifically, switching in support of Ethernet private\r\nline and Ethernet virtual private line services are covered.  Support\r\nfor MEF- and ITU-defined parameters is also covered.","pub_date":"October 2010","keywords":["Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching","Metro Ethernet Forum","MEF"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6004","errata_url":null}
