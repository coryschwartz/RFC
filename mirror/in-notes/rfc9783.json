This specification describes the claims used in an\r\nattestation token generated by PSA-compliant systems, how these\r\nclaims are serialized for transmission, and how they are\r\ncryptographically protected.\r\n\r\nThis Informational document is published as an Independent Submission\r\nto improve interoperability with Arm's architecture. It is not a\r\nstandard nor a product of the IETF.","pub_date":"June 2025","keywords":["Remote Attestation","EAT profile","Evidence","RATS","IoT"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9783","errata_url":null}
