TreeDN enables operators to offer\r\nReplication-as-a-Service (RaaS) at a fraction of the cost of\r\ntraditional, unicast-based CDNs -- in some cases, at no additional\r\ncost to the infrastructure.  In addition to efficiently utilizing\r\nnetwork resources to deliver existing multi-destination traffic, this\r\narchitecture also enables new types of content and use cases that\r\npreviously were not possible or economically viable using traditional\r\nCDN approaches.  Finally, TreeDN is a decentralized architecture and\r\na democratizing technology that makes content distribution more\r\naccessible to more people by dramatically reducing the costs of\r\nreplication.","pub_date":"January 2025","keywords":["multicast","SSM","AMT","LISP","CDN","PIM-SSM"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9706","errata_url":null}
