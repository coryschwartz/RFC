The\r\nTransport Services Application Programming Interface (API) is based\r\non an asynchronous, event-driven interaction pattern. This API uses\r\nMessages for representing data transfer to applications and describes\r\nhow a Transport Services Implementation can use multiple IP\r\naddresses, multiple protocols, and multiple paths and can provide\r\nmultiple application streams. This document provides the architecture\r\nand requirements. It defines common terminology and concepts to be\r\nused in definitions of a Transport Services API and a Transport\r\nServices Implementation.","pub_date":"January 2025","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9621","errata_url":null}
