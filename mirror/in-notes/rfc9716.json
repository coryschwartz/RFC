A Segment\r\nRouting over MPLS (SR-MPLS) network may consist of multiple IGP\r\ndomains or multiple Autonomous Systems (ASes) under the control of\r\nthe same organization.  It is useful to have the Label Switched Path\r\n(LSP) ping and traceroute procedures when an SR end-to-end path\r\ntraverses multiple ASes or IGP domains.  This document outlines\r\nmechanisms to enable efficient LSP ping and traceroute procedures in\r\ninter-AS and inter-domain SR-MPLS networks. This is achieved through\r\na straightforward extension to the Operations, Administration, and\r\nMaintenance (OAM) protocol, relying solely on data plane forwarding\r\nfor handling echo replies on transit nodes.","pub_date":"February 2025","keywords":["OAM","EPE","BGP-LS","BGP","SPRING","SDN"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9716","errata_url":null}
