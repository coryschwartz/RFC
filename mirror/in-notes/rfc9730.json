This helps to tackle challenges arising from multiple\r\ndomains, vendors, and technologies. An example of such a centralized\r\narchitecture is the Abstraction and Control of Traffic-Engineered\r\nNetworks (ACTN) controller hierarchy, as described in RFC 8453.\r\n\r\nBoth the distributed and centralized control planes have their\r\nrespective advantages and should complement each other in the system,\r\nrather than compete. This document outlines how the GMPLS distributed\r\ncontrol plane can work together with a centralized controller system\r\nin a transport network.","pub_date":"March 2025","keywords":["architecture","ACTN","control plane"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9730","errata_url":null}
