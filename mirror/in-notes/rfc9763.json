The use of the relatedCertRequest attribute in a\r\nCSR and the inclusion of the RelatedCertificate extension in the\r\nresulting certificate together provide additional assurance that two\r\ncertificates each belong to the same end entity.  This mechanism is\r\nparticularly useful in the context of non-composite hybrid\r\nauthentication, which enables users to employ the same certificates\r\nin hybrid authentication as in authentication done with only\r\ntraditional or post-quantum algorithms.","pub_date":"June 2025","keywords":["certificate","certificate request","hybrid","authentication","post-quantum","X.509","digital signature","quantum resistant"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9763","errata_url":null}
