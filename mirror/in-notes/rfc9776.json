Version 3 of IGMP (IGMPv3) adds\r\nsupport for source filtering, that is, the ability for a system to\r\nreport interest in receiving packets only from specific source\r\naddresses, or from all but specific source addresses, sent to a\r\nparticular multicast address.  That information may be used by\r\nmulticast routing protocols to avoid delivering multicast packets\r\nfrom specific sources to networks where there are no interested\r\nreceivers.\r\n\r\nThis document specifies IGMPv3.  It is a revised version of RFC 3376\r\nthat includes clarifications and fixes for errata, and it is backward\r\ncompatible with RFC 3376.\r\n\r\nThis document updates RFC 2236 and obsoletes RFC 3376.","pub_date":"March 2025","keywords":[],"obsoletes":["RFC3376"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC2236"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["STD0100"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9776","errata_url":null}
