The RFC Editor makes a brief report to the plenary of each IETF
meeting.  Each report includes a brief summary of the RFC publication
process, including the state of the queue and a breakdown of the
reasons for any long delays in the publication process.  The report
also may include recent changes in policy and improvements in tools or
procedures.
