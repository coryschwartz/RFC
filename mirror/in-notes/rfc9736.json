Most of these are structured as Type,\r\nLength, Value (TLV). One message type, the Peer Up message, lacks a\r\nset of TLVs defined for its use, instead sharing a namespace with the\r\nInitiation message. Experience has shown that this namespace sharing\r\nwas a mistake, as it hampers the extension of the protocol.\r\n\r\nThis document updates RFC 7854 by creating an independent namespace\r\nfor the Peer Up message. It also updates RFCs 8671 and 9069 by moving\r\ndefined codepoints into the newly introduced registry. Compliant\r\nimplementations of RFCs 7854, 8671, and 9069 also comply with this\r\nspecification.","pub_date":"March 2025","keywords":["IDR","GROW","BGP","BMP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC7854","RFC8671","RFC9069"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9736","errata_url":null}
