This helps servers to control resource usage\r\nwhen performing various IMAP operations.  This helps clients to know\r\nthe message limit enforced by the corresponding IMAP server and avoid\r\nissuing commands that would exceed such limit.","pub_date":"March 2025","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9738","errata_url":null}
