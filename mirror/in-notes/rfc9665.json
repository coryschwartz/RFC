This makes it possible to deploy\r\nDNS-SD without multicast, which greatly improves scalability and\r\nimproves performance on networks where multicast service is not an\r\noptimal choice, particularly IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) and IEEE 802.15.4\r\nnetworks.  DNS-SD Service registration uses public keys and SIG(0) to\r\nallow services to defend their registrations.","pub_date":"June 2025","keywords":["Multicast DNS","DNS-Based Service Discovery","DNS Update","SIG(0)"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9665","errata_url":null}
