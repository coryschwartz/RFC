The SR-based\r\nBGP-EPE solution allows a centralized controller, e.g., a\r\nSoftware-Defined Network (SDN) controller, to program any egress\r\npeer. The EPE solution requires the node or the SDN controller to\r\nprogram 1) the PeerNode Segment Identifier (SID) describing a session\r\nbetween two nodes, 2) the PeerAdj SID describing the link or links\r\nthat are used by the sessions between peer nodes, and 3) the PeerSet\r\nSID describing any connected interface to any peer in the related\r\ngroup. This document provides new sub-TLVs for EPE-SIDs that are used\r\nin the Target FEC Stack TLV (Type 1) in MPLS Ping and Traceroute\r\nprocedures.","pub_date":"December 2024","keywords":["OAM","EPE","BGP-LS","BGP","SPRING","SDN","SID"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9703","errata_url":null}
