The proposed extensions improve the handling of host\r\nmobility and duplicate address detection in EVPN-IRB networks to\r\ncover a broader set of scenarios where a host's unicast IP address to\r\nMedia Access Control (MAC) address bindings may change across moves. \r\nThese enhancements address limitations in the existing EVPN-IRB\r\nmobility procedures by providing more efficient and scalable\r\nsolutions. The extensions are backward compatible with existing\r\nEVPN-IRB implementations and aim to optimize network performance in\r\nscenarios involving frequent IP address mobility.","pub_date":"April 2025","keywords":["ES","Ethernet Segment","Peer-Sync-Local","Overlay","NVO","NVO3","RT-2","RT-5","MAC-IP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9721","errata_url":null}
