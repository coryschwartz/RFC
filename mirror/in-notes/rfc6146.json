One or more public IPv4 addresses assigned to a NAT64\r\ntranslator are shared among several IPv6-only clients.  When stateful\r\nNAT64 is used in conjunction with DNS64, no changes are usually\r\nrequired in the IPv6 client or the IPv4 server.","pub_date":"April 2011","keywords":["NAT64","IPv6"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6146","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6146"}
