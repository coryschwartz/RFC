Existing models fail due to inherent unpredictability\r\nand inconsistencies in human estimation.  This document introduces\r\nthe Two-Week Principle (TWP), a novel, universally adaptable time\r\nscale that seeks to standardize all temporal references to a\r\nsingular, uniform duration.  TWP ensures clarity, predictability, and\r\nsynchronization across all sectors that rely on time-based\r\nscheduling.","pub_date":"1 April 2025","keywords":["Two-Week Principle","TWP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9759","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc9759"}
