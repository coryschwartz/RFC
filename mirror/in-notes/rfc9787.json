However, the standards for providing cryptographic\r\nprotection are extremely flexible. That flexibility can trap users\r\nand cause surprising failures. This document offers guidance for Mail\r\nUser Agent (MUA) implementers to help mitigate those risks and to\r\nmake end-to-end email simple and secure for the end user. It provides\r\na useful set of vocabulary as well as recommendations to avoid common\r\nfailures. It also identifies a number of currently unsolved usability\r\nand interoperability problems.","pub_date":"August 2025","keywords":["cryptography","encryption","signature","signing","usability","MIME","confidentiality","integrity","authenticity"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9787","errata_url":null}
