A PLI does not need a PIM\r\nHello message to accept PIM Join\/Prune messages, and it can signal\r\nmulticast states over networks that cannot support full PIM neighbor\r\ndiscovery, such as Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) networks\r\nthat connect two or more PIM domains.  This document outlines the PIM\r\nLight protocol and procedures to ensure loop-free multicast traffic\r\nbetween two or more PIM Light routers.","pub_date":"March 2025","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9739","errata_url":null}
