These procedures have been enhanced further by\r\napplying the Highest Random Weight (HRW) algorithm for DF election to\r\navoid unnecessary DF status changes upon a failure.  This document\r\nimproves these procedures by providing a fast DF election upon\r\nrecovery of the failed link or node associated with the multihomed\r\nEthernet Segment.  This document updates RFC 8584 by optionally\r\nintroducing delays between some of the events therein.\r\n\r\nThe solution is independent of the number of EVPN Instances (EVIs)\r\nassociated with that Ethernet Segment, and it is performed via a\r\nsimple signaling in BGP between the recovered node and each of the\r\nother nodes in the multihoming group.","pub_date":"May 2025","keywords":["EVPN","Designated Forwarder","Convergence","Recovery"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC8584"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9722","errata_url":null}
