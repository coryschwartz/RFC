Facility backup\r\nmethod allows one or more LSPs traversing a connected link or node to\r\nbe protected using a bypass tunnel. The many-to-one nature of local\r\nrepair technique is attractive from a scalability point of view. This\r\ndocument enumerates facility backup procedures in RFC 4090 that rely\r\non refresh timeout, hence, making facility backup method\r\nrefresh-interval dependent. The RSVP-TE extensions defined in this\r\ndocument will enhance the facility backup protection mechanism by\r\nmaking the corresponding procedures refresh-interval independent, and\r\nhence, compatible with the Refresh-Interval Independent RSVP\r\n(RI-RSVP) capability specified in RFC 8370. Hence, this document\r\nupdates RFC 4090 in order to support the RI-RSVP capability specified\r\nin RFC 8370.","pub_date":"March 2025","keywords":["ri-rsvp-frr","RI-RSVP-FRR"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC4090"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9705","errata_url":null}
