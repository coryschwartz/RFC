The objective of MC-LAG is to enhance\r\nboth network availability and bandwidth utilization through various\r\nmodes of traffic load balancing. RFC 7432 defines an EVPN-based\r\nMC-LAG with Single-Active and All-Active multihoming redundancy\r\nmodes. This document builds on the existing redundancy mechanisms\r\nsupported by EVPN and introduces a new active\/standby redundancy\r\nmode, called 'Port-Active'.","pub_date":"June 2025","keywords":["Port-Active","EVPN","Multihoming"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9786","errata_url":null}
