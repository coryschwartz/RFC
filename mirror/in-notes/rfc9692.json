These topologies were initially\r\nused within crossbar interconnects and consequently router and switch\r\nbackplanes, but their characteristics make them ideal for\r\nconstructing IP fabrics as well. The protocol specified by this\r\ndocument is optimized towards the minimization of control plane state\r\nto support very large substrates as well as the minimization of\r\nconfiguration and operational complexity to allow for a simplified\r\ndeployment of said topologies.","pub_date":"April 2025","keywords":["Routing protocol","IGP","Anisotropic routing","Clos","Fat tree","Cloud","Distance vector","Link state","Optimized flooding","Zeroconf","disaggregation","fabric","ZTP","LIE","TIE","TIDE","TIRE","KV-TIE","multi-plane","ToF"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9692","errata_url":null}
